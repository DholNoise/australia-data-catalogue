    "description": "Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are millisecond-duration radio bursts of extragalactic origin. Since the discovery of the first FRB in the archival Parkes/Murriyang multibeam data, a broad dichotomy in population has emerged. Some FRBs have been seen to be repeating, while others are not, despite a significant amount of follow-up using different radio telescopes. The repeating FRB 20240114A was recently discovered by CHIME/FRB, which has been seen to have an exceptionally high burst activity. Such extreme burst activity has not been seen in any other source. The repeating FRBs, such as FRB 20240114A, provide an unparalleled window into their circumburst environment due to their repeating nature, which can be used to constrain possible progenitor models and test underlying emission mechanisms. The previous Parkes/Murriyang source follow-up has also revealed intriguing spectro-polarimetric properties, such as frequency-dependent evolution of burst central frequency or chromaticity, a possible activity window, significantly large circular polarisation (CP), and frequency-dependent CP. These properties hold the key towards understanding the circumburst environment of the FRBs, and test possible progenitor models. A large bandwidth instrument with reliable polarimetry has been critical in uncovering these properties. The ultra-wideband low (UWL) receiver on Parkes/Murriyang is ideally suited to explore the source's wideband spectro-temporal and polarimetric behaviour. We propose a campaign to regularly follow up FRB 20240114A to ascertain its long-term evolution of spectro-temporal properties.",

    "description": "The Climate Vulnerability Assessment was designed to provide an overview of the impact of future climate change on all stages of production for the commodities and biosecurity risks assessed. The project used multicriteria analysis (MCA) models to produce assessments for the commodities and biosecurity risks in a consistent and comparable way, and a framework was developed to provide a rigorous, flexible and transparent process for assessing vulnerabilities and opportunities to climate change. Details of the approach and the climate data used in the assessments can be found in the Methodology Report which also details model exclusions and assumptions.\nAssessments were undertaken on commodities grouped into 6 nodes: Horticulture and Viticulture, Broadacre Cropping, Forestry, Extensive Livestock, Marine Fisheries, as well as for a set of biosecurity risks related to these primary industry sectors. The Summary Report gives details of the chosen commodities and biosecurity risks and summarises the high-level results.\nResults Reports for each commodity and biosecurity risk are being released. Visit the project's web pages to access these reports and for further information.\nThis dataset contains maps of modelled climate suitability for the beef cattle model in the Extensive Livestock node of the DPIRD Climate Vulnerability Assessment. Maps are provided (in GeoTIFF format) for each element of the model: the overall climate suitability, climate suitability maps for each phenophase and also for each phenophase/climate variable combination in the model. Data is provided for each of the eight global climate models (GCMs) used in the project, as well as the climate suitability derived from historical observations, along with the ensemble median for each map.",

The data spans the year of 2015 and is aggregated to 2015 Department of Health Primary Health Network (PHN) areas, based on the 2011 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nThe data is sourced from the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare (AIHW) National Perinatal Data Collection (NPDC) and historical data for time trends. Where the term 'teenage mother' is used the analysis is based on women who gave birth aged under 20. Teenage mothers and their babies are more likely to experience broader disadvantage, have antenatal risk factors and have poorer maternal and baby outcomes during and after birth, than older mothers and their babies. \nThe Teenage Mothers in Australia data accompanies the Teenage Mothers in Australia 2015 Report.\nFor further information about this dataset, visit the data source: Australian Institute of Health and Welfare - Teenage Mothers in Australia 2015 Data Tables.\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data using the Department of Health - PHN Areas.\n\n\nExcludes women not usually resident in Australia or whose usual residence was 'Not stated'.\n\n\nValues assigned &lt;5 or n.p. in the original data have been set to null.\n\n",

The Future Reef MAP project is funded by Rio Tinto Alcan and administered by the Great Barrier Reef Foundation, with an equal co-investment by CSIRO. The project is the first large-scale CO2 observing system established on the Great Barrier Reef using the Rio Tinto ship, RTM Wakmatha. The research is targeted at providing information on the CO2 uptake and the controls on ocean acidification change in the region. It is providing foundation data needed to assess the vulnerability of the GBR reefs to ocean acidification. This dataset contains quality controlled underway measurements of the fugacity of CO2, atmospheric pressure, and sea surface temperature and salinity. The data management and distribution of these data were supported by the CSIRO Carbon Collaboration Cluster and the Australian Coastal Ecosystem Facility.",

    "description": "This dataset presents information and locations related to The Super Tuesday Bike Count event in Palmerston for 2018. The counts are presented as individual points which relate to the location where the counts were undertaken by volunteers.\nThe Super Tuesday Bike Count collects annual figures of bicycle riders and their movements on roads and bike paths. Since 2007, Bicycle Network has conducted bicycle counts at key intersections and corridors selected by local governments. The data is available for researchers and policymakers to plan and build cycling infrastructure to promote increased cycling activity, and to gather longitudinal insights of cycling volumes and trends.\nSuper Tuesday count data is collected visually by volunteer counters at intersections along popular commuter routes, as well as subsidiary routes with lower rider volumes. The count is conducted in southern states (VIC, NSW, SA, WA) between 7:00-9:00am on the first Tuesday of March; and in northern states (QLD, NT) between 6:30-8:30am on the first Tuesday of September. Count locations are nominated by traffic engineers, transport planners, and other transport officers from participating councils. Counters record all movement directions, rider gender, and bicycle volume per fifteen-minute increments on standardised count sheets. \nFor more information please visit the Norther Territory Government Open Data Portal or view the Bicycle Network Super Tuesday Count Report.\nPlease note: \n\nWhere there was no data available (\"no data\", \"NA\", \"#N/A\" in the original data) the values have been set to NULL.\n",

The size of a class is defined as the number of students that exist in a class grouping. Where schools have varying class sizes the following definition is used: -count the class as that which exists for the majority of the time and -which includes the time spent teaching literacy and numeracy and -which the school community regards as a class grouping. Decisions on the class size profile for a school are made at the school level and take into account a number of factors such as the number of teachers available, the balance of enrolments across year levels and class room availability.\nAverage class size is NOT the same as the student/teacher ratio.",

    "description": "This report provides a description of the activities completed during the Outer Darwin Harbour Mapping Survey, from 28 May and 23 June 2015 on the RV Solander (Survey GA0351/SOL6187). This survey was undertaken as a collaboration between Geoscience Australia (GA), the Australian Institute of Marine Science (AIMS) and Department of Land Resource Management (Northern Territory Government) and was funded through the INPEX Offset Habitat Mapping Program for the Darwin Harbour region. The intent of this four year (2014-2018) program is to improve knowledge of the marine environments in the Darwin and Bynoe Harbour regions by collating and collecting baseline data that enable the creation of thematic habitat maps that underpin marine resource management decisions. The specific objectives of survey GA0351/SOL6187 were to:\n\n1.\tObtain high resolution geophysical (bathymetry) data for outer Darwin Harbour, including Shoal Bay;\n2.\tCharacterise substrates (acoustic backscatter properties, grainsize, sediment chemistry) for outer Darwin Harbour, including Shoal Bay; and \n3.\tCollect tidal data for the survey area.\n\nData acquired during the survey included: 720 km2 multibeam sonar bathymetry and acoustic backscatter; 96 sampling stations collecting seabed sediments, underwater photography and video imagery and oceanographic information including tidal data and 54 sound velocity profiles.\n\nYou can also purchase hard copies of Geoscience Australia data and other products at http://www.ga.gov.au/products-services/how-to-order-products/sales-centre.html",

Fourtytwo sources have been discovered in targeted observations of Fermi unidentified point sources, two towards Supernova Remnants, 19 in the Magellanic Clouds, 105 in Globular Clusters and 81 in a survey of the Galactic plane. A large fraction of the new discoveries are recycled pulsars (including a few relativistic systems and several 'spider' binaries), or young pulsars. Timing observations have an essential role in exploiting the full potential of any pulsar discovery, allowing for the precise measurement of rotational, astrometric and orbital parameters which, in turn, give us powerful tools to improve our understanding of the physics in extreme environments as well as of the population of neutron stars as a whole. The UWL receiver of the Parkes telescope is a sensitive, versatile instrument that is allowing us to successfully time these new sources, in the bright-end of TRAPUM discoveries.",

    "description": "Paper presented at the Australian Agricultural and Resource Economics Society (AARES) 2016 Conference. \r\n\r\n Achieving an efficient allocation of fishery resource stocks between commercial and recreational fishers is often hampered by incomplete information about the economic value of these fisheries to the community. Economic data for Australia's recreational fishing sector are currently not readily available in a form that can be used for resource allocation decisions. The little data that are available provide a limited picture of the economic value of the sector. This is largely due to the non-market nature of goods produced by recreational fishing. \r\n\r\n This paper provides a theoretical framework for how non-market values associated with recreational fishing can be derived using the travel cost method. It then combines this with economic information from the commercial sector to assess the effect of changes in allocation of a fish stock between recreational and commercial fishers. The framework assumes that the commercial and recreational catch is regulated via a total allowable catch. The paper also highlights some of the impediments of using this framework in applied analysis. The description of the travel cost method in a recreational fishing context is supported by a summary of some recent work undertaken by ABARES in valuing game fishing activities in eastern Australia. \r\n",

Captured by digitizing a line along the centre of a linear geographic feature. Includes the waterway name, a unique asset identifier, EPMS/asset section number (to link the object to associated drawings) and key attributes to assist with its intended purpose. When used in conjunction with the constructed waterways centreline and waterway connector centreline layers, this layer completes the waterway/hydrology linear network (complete centreline) for Melbourne Water’s non-underground drainage assets. Data set is used to indicate the location and types of natural waterways for asset management and maintenance works, to assess buildover or planning applications, for waterway rehabilitation works and flow management (helping maintain the flow of water and reduce the impacts of floods), ongoing condition monitoring and hydrologic modelling and analysis and to assist with the planning and design, construction of new waterway corridors, stormwater management (WSUD) options.Waterway (Reach) layer created from original FIS 1:50K (Vicmap Hydro) streams data set which included only those waterways within catchments of greater than 60ha. Waterways (Reach) Rectification project undertaken 2001 to 2003 to review and correct the extent of the waterways reach network to ensure a complete data set exists (using the Drainage Metropolis Boundary, 50K data, 1:2500 Drainage Record Plans, Drainage Limits data, orthophotos, as constructed and/or design drawings, contour data and Melway Street Directory). Waterway (Reach) extents defined and attributes populated in GIS and AMIS for all records including assigning nodes and node numbers (for start / end points) and removing any reaches less than 100 metres in length that are predominantly channel assets. Waterways in extended area incorporated in 2005 using Vicmap Hydro data and aerial imagery, then updated in 2009/10 using Lidar survey data (contours). Data is maintained using Lidar survey data (contours) and 60 ha limits. Please refer to metadata for each record in dataset for specific source / accuracy information.NOTE: Whilst every effort has been taken in collecting, validating and providing the attached data, Melbourne Water Corporation makes no representations or guarantees as to the accuracy or completeness of this data.

    "description": "Sediment traps (IMOS platform code:SAZOTS) are cones which intercept and store falling marine particles in collection cups. The particles consist of a range of material including phytoplankton, zooplankton, faecal pellets, and dust. Each trap collects a time series of samples. The sediment traps are from deep moorings in the Southern Ocean, typically at 47S, 54S, and 61S and at around 140 degrees East. Each mooring typically has 2-3 traps between 800m and 3800m below sea-level.\n\nThe samples are size fractionated into <1mm and >1mm fractions using a 1mm sieve. Various chemical analyses and observations have been made on the <1mm fraction. Analysis methods are described in the attached document \"SAZ PROJECT MOORED SEDIMENT TRAPS: RESULTS OF THE 1997-1998 DEPLOYMENTS\".\n\nPhotographs of the >1mm fraction from 1998 to 2012 are available here for download. After processing, data from IMOS deployments will be made available.\n\nPreliminary biogeochemical data for the sediment traps on the 2008/09 mooring are available. These preliminary data are indicative only and have not been quality controlled. Analysis of the samples is ongoing. A full dataset for this sediment trap deployment will be made available through the IMOS Ocean Portal when analysis is complete.",

    "description": "This dataset contains status, location and directional information for each pedestrian sensor device installed throughout the city.  The sensor_id column can be used to merge the data with related datasets. \nSince the inauguration of the Pedestrian Counting System in 2009, some sensor devices have been removed or relocated. This may be for various reasons such as construction works. Others may be inactive due to a temporary issue. This is detailed in the notes column.  Any changes to sensor locations are important to consider when analysing and interpreting historical pedestrian counting data.\nSensors are typically installed under an awning or on a street pole to form a counting zone on the footpath below. They record bi-directional pedestrian movements through the zone, 24 hours, every day. Locations are selected based on three criteria – retail and event activity, regular pedestrian use and the egress and entry flow to these areas. The system records movements, not images, so no individual information is collected.  New sensor devices have been recently installed, with more to come in the near future as part of the city’s commitment to expanding the system. \nStatus field:\nThis field indicates if the sensor is expected to be active and is manually maintained as needed. A pedestrian sensor with an active value ('A') may be unavailable in some situations. \nA representation of pedestrian volume which compares each location on any given day and time can be found in our Online Visualisation.Related datasets: Pedestrian Counting System – 2009 to Present (counts per hour)Pedestrian Counting System – Past Hour (counts per minute)",

    "description": "This dataset presents the footprint of the percentage of tobacco use, alcohol risk and recent illicit drug use for people aged 14 years and over. The data spans the year of 2016 and is aggregated to Statistical Area Level 4 (SA4) geographic areas from the 2011 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nThe data is sourced from the 2016 National Drug Strategy Household Survey (NDSHS). The NDSHS is the leading survey of licit and illicit drug use in Australia. The 2016 survey was the 12th conducted under the auspices of the NDS. Previous surveys were conducted in 1985, 1988, 1991, 1993, 1995, 1998, 2001, 2004, 2007, 2010 and 2013. The data collected through these surveys have contributed to the development of policies for Australia's response to drug-related issues.\nThe NDSHS data accompanies the National Drug Strategy Household Survey 2016: Detailed Findings Report.\nFor further information about this dataset, please visit: \n\n\nAustralian Institute of Health and Welfare - National Drug Strategy Household Survey 2016 Data Tables.\n\n\nNational Drug Strategy Household Survey 2016 - Data Quality Statement.\n\n\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data.\n\n\nThe calculation of alcohol risk was updated in 2013. 'Abstainers' no longer equate to 'never' and 'ex-drinkers' combined because the calculation now excludes drinkers who did not indicate the quantity of alcohol they consumed. Trend data will not match the data presented in previous reports. Refer to technical notes for further details.\n\n\nRecent illicit drug use is defined as illicit drug use in the previous 12 months.\n\n",

    "description": "Since the 1980s the managers of alpine resorts have collected information on visitation numbers.  Information on the number of visitors and the number of visitor days (visitors X length of stay) is collected on a weekly basis, based on entry pass sales information.  Visitation by visitors entering on single or multiple day passes is readily determined from actual pass sales, whilst visitation by the holders of season entry passes is based on estimates.\nCommencing in 2006, the Alpine Resorts Co-ordinating Council and the Alpine Resort Management Boards have conducted a consistent survey of visitation by season entry pass holders at all resorts, to better estimate visitation.  Each season entry pass holder is sent a survey card and asked to fill in details of their visits (including length of stay and passenger numbers) and return their survey cards to the Council.\nAt the end of the winter season, following analysis of the survey returns, Council adjusts the figures from the final week of the winter season to produce the annually-published ‘End-of-Season’ results.",

    "description": "Study Area\n\nThe study area is located in south west Sydney and covers most of the suburbs of Chullora and Potts\nHill and small parts of the suburbs of Yagoona, Greenacre and Bankstown. It is an urban catchment\nthat drains through a stormwater pipe network and Freshwater Creek in a north-easterly direction to\nthe Cooks River. The catchment is bounded by the Hume Highway to the south and east, and the\nrailway line to the north. The Rookwood Road catchment is wholly within the Bankstown City local\ngovernment area (LGA).\n\nOutcomes from the Study\n\nThe main outcomes from this study include:\n<ul>\n<li>A database of all Council drainage assets within the study area;</li>\n<li>Establishment of a computer model capable of assessing flood behaviour;</li>\n<li>Information on flood behaviour under existing catchment conditions;</li>\n<li>Predicted change in flood levels due to the potential impacts of climate change; and</li>\n<li>A model that can be used to assess flood mitigation options and future development proposals.</li>\n</ul>\n\nDatabase of Drainage Assets\n\nAll drainage asset data collected by Council for the study has been incorporated into a GIS database.\n\nThis allows the data to be spatially represented across the study area and easily retrieved as\nrequired. Information in the database includes data for some 550 stormwater pits and 680 stormwater\ndrainage pipes.\n\nOther catchment data, including aerial photography, property cadastre, building footprints and the\nterrain surface (based on ALS survey) is also incorporated into a GIS database.\n\nComputer Modelling\n\nA numerical computer model was developed for the catchment to simulate flood behaviour, using the\nsoftware TUFLOW. Surface flows are represented in the model through a two-dimensional grid\ncovering the entire study area. The stormwater pit and pipe network is included as one-dimensional\nelements within this grid. Full details of the modelling approach, modelling parameters and other\nassumptions are outlined in the Rookwood Road Catchment Flood Modelling Report, which is\nincluded as Appendix C.\n\nExisting Flood Behaviour\n\nDesign flood behaviour has been computed for a range of floods, ranging from relatively frequent\nevents to more extreme floods.\n\nThe model produces a grid of results over the study area providing data on flood levels, flood depths\nand flood velocities. Flood level contours have also been prepared showing contours of flood heights\nthroughout the study area. This data is provided digitally and can be overlaid on base mapping such\nas aerial photos and cadastral plans showing property boundaries.\n\nAll flood model results have been provided to Council for incorporation into their GIS database. Much\nof this information is also included as A4 sized plans included in Appendix C.\nIt is understood that once the Flood Study has been adopted by Council, the GIS information\nresulting from this Flood Study will be used for floodplain management purposes, including\nassessment of flood-related development constraints on properties. Potential flood mitigation options\nwill be assessed in the subsequent Floodplain Risk Management Study phase of the floodplain risk\nmanagement process.",

    "description": "The atomic interstellar medium shows tiny-scale optical depth fluctuations on the scale of 0.1~10,000 AU, whose origin and nature are poorly understood. The existence of this Tiny-Scale Atomic Structure (TSAS) has significant implications, potentially calling into question our fundamental understanding of heating, cooling and dynamical processes in the interstellar medium. Yet observations remain sparse. This long-term project plans to search for temporal variations in HI absorption spectra seen against background pulsars to characterise TSAS in the Milky Way interstellar medium (ISM). These observations constitute the largest number of sightlines and densest temporal sampling ever performed in a single experiment, and will test predictions that TSAS is the tail end of a turbulent cascade, constrain its minimum size scale (down to resolutions of ~0.05 AU) and potentially provide the first direct measurements of pressures in \"large\" TSAS features of &gt; 1000 AU. We make use of the phase-resolved spectral line mode that we have recently implemented on Parkes, which has cut data rates and processing times by factors of ~1000 compared to past studies. This is an expansion of our pilot P1321 to a long term study.",

The survey follows an established method to collect relevant, timely and valid health information which is applied to policy development and strategic planning.\nInformation is collected via computer assisted telephone interview on overall self-rated health status, level of psychological distress, body mass index (to determine weight status), the presence of chronic diseases, nutrition, physical activity, smoking and alcohol consumption. Information is also collected on participation in screening for bowel cancer, breast cancer, high blood pressure, cholesterol and high blood sugar in addition to community participation, levels of social support and connections with others.\nInterviews are also conducted in the major non-English languages in Victoria to ensure people of culturally and linguistically diverse backgrounds are included.",

    "description": "This dataset is a component of the 'Jervis Bay Baseline Studies' project conducted by the Department of Defence, CSIRO and the Australian Defence Force Academy. \n\nApproximately once per month between 1988-1991, temperature-salinity surveys were conducted within Jervis Bay and out across the continental shelf. Measurements were made using a Neil Brown 'Smart' CTD. On each day of sampling, ~10 stations were chosen across the shelf, with the CTD recorder measuring salinity, temperature and sigma-T through the water column.\n\nThis record describes CTD data collected in 1989. For each day of sampling three resources are provided: 1) A text document providing details of sampling locations, as well as a CTD summary collected from each of the stations every 4-10 metres down the water column, 2) A map showing the location of each sampling station and, 3) An excel file providing the raw CTD data collected.\n\nThis is one of nine child records that relate to the parent, 13391430-2ae8-11dd-a735-00188b4c0af8. A pdf outlining the structure and hierarchy of all metadata records relating to this project is available to download through this record. Also available is a pdf of a published working paper documenting this experiment and the results.",

    "description": "The Polynya2 (Mertz region) deepwater mooring was deployed on 2011-01-22 at (-66.20 S, 143.21 E) off the Adelie Land Coast in Antarctica, and was recovered in January 2015. In February 2014 a second array was deployed in a new location near the Totten Glacier.\n\nInstrumentation includes 75kHz Acoustic Doppler Current Profilers (RDI longranger ADCPs), Seabird SBE37s (SM and SMP) and 16plus V2.\n\nThe mooring will collect a time series of full-depth profiles of water velocity and discrete temperature and salinity measurement at four depth on each mooring, between the seafloor and 300m depth (the mooring are limited to this depth to avoid contact with icebergs).\n\nThis Polynya mooring array will re-continue the time series of bottom water export begun in 2008, using observation strategy, modified as required following recovery of the array in 2009.\n\nThe aim of the IMOS Polynya mooring array is to measure the export of dense Antarctic Bottom Water from the Adélie Land coast. Sinking of dense water near Antarctica supplies the deep branch of the global overturning circulation, a pattern of ocean currents that strongly influences climate. Several studies have recently shown that the properties of the bottom water in the Australian Antarctic Basin are changing. Monitoring the temperature, salinity and oxygen of bottom water will provide observations to detect how the Southern Ocean limb of the overturning circulation is responding to changes in high latitude climate forcing. The goal of the new Totten region location is to obtain measurements of \"warm\" inflow to, and (if possible) outflow from the Totten Glacier system. As it happened, access right to the Totten was not possible, and moorings were sited closer to the Dalton Iceberg Tongue and Moscow University Ice Shelf, possibly part of the Totten inflow story.",

    "description": "Overview  \r\n Research, development and extension (RD&E) is central to the competitiveness of Australia's agriculture industry. Growth in investment pushed the value of RD&E funding in Australia to $3.3 billion in 2014-15. Funding for rural R&D increased from $2.6 billion ten years before, in real terms. This includes public and private investment related to primary production, sustainable resource use, agricultural inputs and the processing sector. \r\n\r\n\r\nKey Issues \r\n Public sector delivering the R&D building blocks  \r\n\r\n• The public sector remains the largest overall source of rural R&D funding. Public funding for rural R&D increased from $1.4 billion to $1.54 billion (in real terms). This growth was driven by growth in funding from the Australian Government and universities, which offset a decline in funding from the state and territory governments. The public sector plays an important role in funding R&D particularly longer-term fundamental research. \r\n\r\n Private sector funding boosting R&D investment  \r\n\r\n• The private sector funding grew strongly over the ten years examined and now plays a greater role in funding rural R&D. Total private R&D funding increased from $912 million in 2005-06 to $1.46 billion in 2014-15 in real terms. Greater private funding stemmed from private firms increasing investment in their own R&D, with slower growth in contributions to the rural Research and Development Corporations (RDCs). \r\n\r\n Based on recent trends in Australia and internationally, the private sector has the potential to play a greater role in Australian R&D investment. The private sector concentres on marketable technologies like those related to seeds or chemicals that are more likely to generate additional profits. However, growth in private sector investment is not guaranteed and will depend on both the expected return on R&D investment and the international competitiveness of our R&D providers. \r\n\r\n Extending the ideas  \r\n\r\n• Getting innovations out of the laboratory and in to the field and factory is also essential to lift producer efficiency. Total rural extension funding is estimated at $316 million in 2014-15. Just under half of this funding was provided by the private sector through farm advisors to boost farm profitability. \r\n",

We acknowledge here the traditional custodians of this land, Kay-ye-my (denoting 'manly') clan of the Guringai people, and pay our respects to their elders past and present.\nMHL was established in 1944 under the then NSW Department of Public Works (now Public Works Advisory), to undertake hydraulic studies of the Oberon Dam. MHL is now a business unit within the Water Division of the Department of Planning and Environment.\nSince its establishment, MHL has developed specialist capabilities and experience in a range of coastal, water and environmental management areas to become NSW Government's specialist professional advisor in its core capability areas, which include:\n- flow and water quality measurement and investigations\n- oceanographic, coastal, estuarine and riverine process studies\n- investigation and design of hydraulic, coastal and maritime structures.\nMHL's recognised capabilities include the use of physical and numerical models integrated with our extensive coastal data collection and management experience to maximise public value in the solutions and advice we provide.\nMHL's experienced hydrographers operate one of the world's most comprehensive coastal and environmental data collection networks on behalf of NSW Government, hosting over 16,000 station years of continuous data extending from the 1980s.\nProfessional engineers and scientists utilise both numerical models and scaled physical hydraulic models in a broad range of studies. Our irregular and multi-directional wave modelling facilities and NATA accredited flow meter calibration capability are unmatched in Australia. MHL's commercial boats and registered divers offer scientific reconnaissance and maritime structure assessment capabilities.",

    "title": "South Australia - National Intertidal-Subtidal Benthic NISB Habitat Map (PLUS)",
    "description": "The NISB Habitat Map was created by the University of Tasmania for a partnership between the Department of Climate Change and the National Land and Water Resources Audit. It supports the DCC/Audit partnership by providing a nationally consistent set of the available mapping data for those habitats that occur between the approximate position of the highest astronomical tide mark (HAT) and the location of the outer limit of the photic benthic zone (approximately at the 50-70 m depth contour). This area is broadly equivalent to the 'inner' and 'mid-shelf' regions identified by Geoscience Australia. The resulting map data set forms a core component of the ECM National Habitat Map Series. The habitat classes include: coral reef, rock dominated habitat, sediment dominated habitat, mangroves, saltmarsh, seagrass, macroalgae and filter feeders (e.g. sponges), as defined in the NISB Habitat Classification Scheme. The scheme is designed to support the development of marine 'ecoregions' or bioregional subregions. Details of the scheme and the process of its development are available in National Intertidal/Subtidal Benthic (NISB) Habitat Classification Scheme Version 1 (Mount, Bricher and Newton, 2007). The NISB Habitat Map consists of two layers for each state. _NISB.shp consists of the entire available habitat mapping at a resolution finer than 1:50 000 (with a few exceptions, outlined in the data quality section below). _NISB_PLUS.shp consists of all the data in _NISB.shp along with coarser resolution data, including NVIS and OzEstuaries data. These layers were used to produce the National ECM Key Habitat Distribution Map Series 10 km and 50 km tile maps.\r\n\r\nNote: This data is labelled as “NISB_plus”, indicating that it is the NISB Habitat layer plus other lower quality layers.",

    "description": "The <strong>Climate Vulnerability Assessment</strong> was designed to provide an overview of the impact of future climate change on all stages of production for the commodities and biosecurity risks assessed. The project used multicriteria analysis (MCA) models to produce assessments for the commodities and biosecurity risks in a consistent and comparable way, and a framework was developed to provide a rigorous, flexible and transparent process for assessing vulnerabilities and opportunities to climate change. Details of the approach and the climate data used in the assessments can be found in the <a href=\"https://www.dpi.nsw.gov.au/dpi/climate/climate-vulnerability-assessment/publications-and-reports\">Methodology Report</a> which also details model exclusions and assumptions.\n\nAssessments were undertaken on commodities grouped into 6 nodes: <em>Horticulture and Viticulture</em>, <em>Broadacre Cropping</em>, <em>Forestry</em>, <em>Extensive Livestock</em>, <em>Marine Fisheries</em>, as well as for a set of biosecurity risks related to these primary industry sectors. The <a href=\"https://www.dpi.nsw.gov.au/dpi/climate/climate-vulnerability-assessment/publications-and-reports\">Summary Report</a> gives details of the chosen commodities and biosecurity risks and summarises the high-level results.\n\nResults Reports for each commodity and biosecurity risk are being released. Visit the <a href=\"https://www.dpi.nsw.gov.au/dpi/climate/climate-vulnerability-assessment\">project's web pages</a> to access these reports and for further information.\n\nThis dataset contains maps of modelled climate suitability for the <strong>dryland wheat</strong> model in the Broadacre Cropping node of the DPIRD Climate Vulnerability Assessment. Maps are provided (in GeoTIFF format) for each element of the model: the overall climate suitability, climate suitability maps for each phenophase and also for each phenophase/climate variable combination in the model. Data is provided for each of the eight global climate models (GCMs) used in the project, as well as the climate suitability derived from historical observations, along with the ensemble median for each map.",

    "description": "This dataset presents the footprint of the percentage of adults who saw a GP more than 12 times in the preceding 12 months. The data spans the years of 2015-2017 and is aggregated to 2015 Department of Health Primary Health Network (PHN) areas, based on the 2011 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nThe data is sourced from the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) 2016-17 Patient Experience Survey, collected between 1 July 2016 and 30 June 2017. It also includes data from previous Patient Experience Surveys conducted in 2013-14, 2014-15 and 2015-16. The Patient Experience Survey is conducted annually by the ABS and collects information from a representative sample of the Australian population. The Patient Experience Survey is one of several components of the Multipurpose Household Survey, as a supplement to the monthly Labour Force Survey. The Patient Experience Survey collects data on persons aged 15 years and over, who are referred to as adults for this data collection.\nFor further information about this dataset, visit the data source:Australian Institute of Health and Welfare - Patient experiences in Australia Data Tables.\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data using the Department of Health - PHN Areas.\n\n\nPercentages are calculated based on counts that have been randomly adjusted by the ABS to avoid the release of confidential data.\n\n\nAs an indication of the accuracy of estimates, 95% confidence intervals were produced. These were calculated by the ABS using standard error estimates of the proportion.\n\n\nSome of the patient experience measures for 2016-17 have age-standardised rates presented. Age-standardised rates are hypothetical rates that would have been observed if the populations studied had the same age distribution as the standard population.\n\n\nCrude rates are provided for all years. They should be used for understanding the patterns of actual service use or level of experience in a particular PHN.\n\n\nThe Patient Experience Survey excludes persons aged less than 15 years, persons living in non-private dwellings and the Indigenous Community Strata (encompassing discrete Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities).\n\n\nData for Northern Territory should be interpreted with caution as the Patient Experience Survey excluded the Indigenous Community Strata, which comprises around 25% of the estimated resident population of the Northern Territory living in private dwellings.\n\n\nRows that contain a \"#\" in \"Interpret with Caution\" indicates that the estimate has a relative standard error of 25% to 50%, which indicates a high level of sampling error relative to its value and must be taken into account when comparing this estimate with other values.\n\n\nNP - Not available for publication. The estimate is considered to be unreliable. Values assigned to NP in the original data have been set to null.\n\n",

    "description": "Address2 is a variant of the ADDRESS product and splits address vertically to overcome the 2 Gigabyte DBASE limit when delivering address in a MapInfo or Shapefile format.\nThe layer and table names are:-\nADDRESS_MAIN\nADDRESS_SUP\nUsers should use VICMAP_ADDRESS in all other circumstances. See metadata record VICMAP_ADDRESS (Vicmap Address) ANZVI0803002578\n\nVicmap Address is Victoria's authoritative geocoded database of property address points.  The data includes predominately, but not exclusively, locational property address identifiers assigned by Local Government, considered to be the primary creator and custodian of property address.  If accessible, other 'real life' property addresses created and used by the community, but not recognized by Local Government including retirement villages, assisted care facilities, industrial and public housing estates etc. are included. The 2011/2012 audit against Local Government addressing revealed a 97.41% match rate, increased from 92.43% in 2008/2009 following the 2009 Address Completion Initiative. Key validation fields are 'source' and 'source_verified', respectively indicating the address source and date last validated against that source. The minimum address attributes required for a property address to be included in Vicmap Address are road name and locality. However, the principal address details include the unit/house number(s), road name (including any type or suffix) and locality (town/suburb/rural district). Vicmap Address is jointly maintained with Vicmap Property (VMPROP), with every address relating to a VMPROP  record, joined through a property_pfi link. Many additional attributes are included, where available, to facilitate use and relevance to the user community.\nN.B. Specifically excluded are non-property related, and electronic address details such as email, post office (PO) boxes, roadside delivery points (RSD's), roadside mail boxes (RMB's) and the like.\nCurrent data model: Version 6.1 (Oct 2016)",

    "description": "Based on Landgate’s high resolution aerial imagery, CSIRO generate the Urban Monitor mosaic from which vegetation height strata of endemic and exotic species has been calculated and reported as an area for each height strata of 0 – 3 m, 3 – 8 m, 8 – 15 m and 15+ m. The area of grass covered areas falling into the 0 – 50 cm range has also been calculated and recorded in square metres. Vegetation coverage greater than 3 metres in height has been deemed tree canopy. The canopies have been aggregated and reported as total canopy coverage in square metres. Urban Forest Mesh Blocks have been published for the following years: 2009, 2014, 2016, 2018.\n\nParcels to be analysed were sourced from the 2016 Integrated Land Information Database (ILID) and supplied to CSIRO by the Department of Planning, Lands and Heritage. The results were assembled into Urban Forest features where the Urban Monitor coverage was complete.\n\nLand parcels were assigned locational data (2016 ABS meshblocks, suburbs, local government authority (LGA) and planning sub-region) based on the parcel centroid. They were then attributed with the following land use categories: • Street Block: residential, commercial, industrial, hospital/medical, educational, and some agricultural and transport land uses • Parks: public parks, open space, private recreation grounds and State Forest • Roads: roads including road reserves • Other Infrastructure: rail, airports and utilities infrastructure • Other: land uses in transition that have not progressed sufficiently to be Street Blocks or do not conform to urban form • Rural: primary production land that does not fall in categories above • Water: ocean and other waterways, including reservoirs\n\nThe vegetation height strata areas and total canopy coverage values were calculated for each land parcel. The statistics were then aggregated by the field MB_MonitorCategory, a concatenation of the fields MB_CODE16 and MonitorCategory. Canopy coverage percentages and ranges were calculated based on the sum of the area of parcels within each MB_MonitoryCategory. As parcels with sufficient Urban Monitor coverage for Urban Forest analysis may vary between years making comparison difficult, a field called MBPercentage was added which shows the percentage of the total MB_MonitorCategory area (MBArea) covered by parcels with Urban Forest values for that year. Corresponding MBPercentage values for all published years were also added to inform users.\n\nNOTE: As mesh block attributes were assigned based on parcel centroid, aggregated mesh block boundaries based on the parcels may not match ABS mesh block boundaries, and MBAreas will not match ABS mesh block areas.",

    "description": "Mating signals are often directed at numerous senses, and provide information about species identity, gender, receptiveness, individual identity and mate quality. Male fiddler crabs of the species Uca mjoebergi typically have an enlarged yellow claw which they use for fighting and attracting a mate using a waving action. \n\nExperiments were conducted between Sept 03' to Jan '04 in the vicinity of the mangrove boardwalk in the East Point Reserve, Darwin, NT. \n\nThe experiment was designed to demonstrate the use of claw colouration as a species recognition signal in the fiddler crab Uca mjoebergi. To test this, females were given a choice between size-matched, and handed matched U.signata and U.mjoebergi males. The colour of the males claw was manipulated using Dulux Tinytin gloss enamel paint.\n\nClaw colour was found to be the dominant morphological feature in identifying conspecific males in U.mjoebergi.\n\nMeasurements taken during every trial included: carapace size (males and females), treatment (males), claw size (males), claw side (males), number of trials, trial arrangement, and female choice.",

    "description": "Stands of remnant trees are important for conservation of biodiversity in the Urban District of Hornsby Shire. Particularly important are the stands of Blue Gum Shale Forest, Blue Gum Diatreme Forest and Turpentine-Ironbark Forest trees, because even in the absence of a native understorey, these are recognised as critically endangered or endangered communities under the NSW legislation (but not under the Commonwealth legislation).\nTwo separate studies of remnant trees were carried out - the urban district and the southern rural district.\nFor the urban district, a total of 569 stands of remnant trees were mapped, ranging in size up to about 2.9 ha, although predominantly less than 1 ha. The total area of the stands was about 130 ha in March 2007. The stands are remnants of 15 different native vegetation communities. Three of the communities are listed as critically endangered under either Commonwealth or NSW legislation; four others are listed as endangered; one is considered significant at regional level (Sydney region); and two are considered locally significant (Hornsby Shire).\nFor the southern rural district, A total of 866 stands of remnant trees were mapped, ranging in size up to about 6 ha. The total area of the stands was 408.8 ha in March 2007. The stands are remnants of 14 different native vegetation communities. Two of the communities are listed as critically endangered under Commonwealth legislation; three others are listed as endangered under NSW legislation; two others are considered significant at regional level around Sydney; and two others are considered locally significant in Hornsby Shire. Two of the communities (Shale Gravel Transition Forest and Angophora-Red Mahogany Forest) appear to be represented in Hornsby Shire only by remnant trees; these communities have not been recorded in the bushland areas of Hornsby Shire.

    "description": "This dataset estimates human mobility through origin destination (OD) movement flow among the Statistical Area 2 (SA2) regions in Queensland (QLD), connected by public transport (PT) networks. The SA2 regions of Queensland connected by buses, trains, trams and ferries have been used to evaluate OD movement flows. The passenger OD movement data among different stations (or the station-based OD flow) are first estimated using a statistical estimation methodology. The stations-based OD flow data are then translated into region-based OD matrices using the state-of-art method. For more information please see the original metadata file here.\nHuman mobility data is a key ingredient in various areas and domains of research including epidemiology, policy and administration, criminology, transportation, logistics and supply chains, environmental management and, pollution and contamination. High quality human mobility data provided by telecommunication companies collected from call data records (CDRs) is available at prohibitive cost with restrictive licensing, keeping it out of reach for the majority of research community. On the other hand, there is an abundance of high-quality public data, reporting different aspects of mobility. Examples are the public transport patronage and information about the usage of the Australian road network. These datasets are collected by different organisations and government departments and are presented in various formats. For instance, data may be collected at different spatial (e.g. at state or postcode levels) and temporal scales and be presented in the form of passenger counts or aggregated movement flows. This dataset addresses the general lack of national scale comprehensive human mobility dataset in Australia by transforming available mobility data into a consistent format that is suitable for analysis in a broad range of research areas. Merging the various individual datasets into Australia's first comprehensive, national-scale human mobility data asset drastically improves the quality and coverage of existing datasets.\nThe Mobility Australia project received investment (https://doi.org/10.47486/DP702) from the Australian Research Data Commons (ARDC). The ARDC is funded by the National Collaborative Research Infrastructure Strategy (NCRIS).\nThe original data tables were structured in a matrix-like format. AURIN employed a methodology to merge diverse datasets into a comprehensive one, categorising based on transportation types (e.g., trains, buses, rails, ferries), years (e.g., 2019, 2020, 2021, etc.), and temporal scales (e.g., weekly, monthly, yearly). Subsequently, AURIN spatially enabled the original data by employing the 2021 edition of the Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS). The flow between origin and destination pairs is visually represented using line geometry.",

    "description": "This dataset represents the intrinsic aquifer vulnerability to contamination evaluated for unconfined aquifers in Fitzroy, based on the DRASTIC method (Aller et al. 1987). This semi-quantitative but spatially distributed method is especially suited for regional investigations with limited data availability. The DRASTIC index is calculated based on seven components: Depth to groundwater, net recharge, Aquifer media, soil media, topography (slope), impact of vadose zone and hydraulic conductivity of the aquifer (Aller et al. 1987). Areas with unconfined aquifers or with shallow water tables receive a high index and, vice versa, area with fractured rock aquifers and deep water tables have a low index.\n\nFor the Fitzroy region, based on the spatial distribution of the index values, unconfined aquifer contamination due to a spill at the surface is considered not possible if the DRASTIC index is less than 70. In grid cells with a DRASTIC index between 70 and 100, unconfined aquifer contamination due to a spill at the surface is considered possible but not material. In areas with DRASTIC indices above 100, unconfined aquifer contamination due to a spill at the surface is considered material and avoidance and mitigation strategies are considered.\n\nFurther information about the DRASTIC map and the development of this map is described in Holland et al. (2024) [Securing water for an emerging Australian hydrogen industry - Methods report].",

    "description": "A gravity core (GC10) was collected from a depth of 335 mbsl within the Capricorn Channel, southern Great Barrier Reef (GBR). Analysis of other parameters revealed the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) sitting at a depth of ~130cm into the core. Three samples were collected for X-ray Diffraction (XRD) analysis; at the sediment surface (GC10-0) representing interglacial sediment, 100cm depth (GC10-100) and 270cm (GC10-270) - both of which represent glacial sediment. XRD analysis shows that during the interglacials aragonite increases relative to calcite, presumably as a result of shelf carbonate transported down the channel. During the glacials there is a higher percentage of quartz and feldspar, but reduced clay content in the non-carbonate fraction. This suggests that the terrigenous fraction is dominant within the sediments, however the energy in the environment is possibly too high for the clays to settle.",

The upper 140cm of the core was used in this study and was composed of very fine yellow-brown coloured clay. The sediments are slightly laminated, indicative of a low energy deposition regime. The core also shows 'black specks' in different concentrations, which is indicative of the appearance of a darker, non-carbonate fraction.",

    "description": "This data was collected in February - March 2013 by the IMOS Ship of Opportunity Underway CO2 Measurement research group on RV Aurora Australis (IMOS platform code: VNAA) voyage AA1213V4.\n\nDeparted: \tHobart, Tasmania, February 28, 2013\nArrived:  Hobart, Tasmania,  March 14, 2013\n\nCO2 System Overview:\nThe fugacity of carbon dioxide (fCO2) in surface seawater was measured using a General Oceanics Inc. automated system (Model 8050; Pierrot et al 2009). Seawater is sprayed into an equilibration chamber and CO2 in the headspace gas equilibrates with the seawater. The headspace gas is pumped through a thermoelectric condenser followed by a nafion drying tube before flowing through a Licor 7000 non-dispersive infrared gas analyser used to measure the CO2 mole fraction (XCO2) of the dried air. The gas flow is stopped temporarily for the CO2 measurements, which are made at atmospheric pressure. A set of four CO2 standards that cover the range of CO2 values expected in the ocean are analysed about every three hours to calibrate the gas analyser.  Atmospheric XCO2 (dry) is measured after the standards by pumping clean outside air from an intake on the forward mast of the ship. \n\nSeawater intake and ancillary data:\nThe seawater intake is at about 6 m depth. A remote temperature sensor (Seabird Electronics SBE38) located at the intake is used to measure sea surface temperature (SST). Sea surface salinity is measured using a thermosalinograph (Seabird Electronics SBE21) mounted in the oceanographic lab next to the pCO2 system. The travel time between the intake and CO2 system is typically about 70 seconds with warming usually less than 0.7ºC in cold waters near freezing. The thermosalinograph water is from the same intake and supply line. \n\nMeteorological data, salinity, SST, and ships position and time are taken from the ship’s logging system.",

    "description": "This dataset is a component of the 'Jervis Bay Baseline Studies' project conducted by the Department of Defence, CSIRO and the Australian Defence Force Academy. \n\nApproximately once per month between 1988-1991, temperature-salinity surveys were conducted within Jervis Bay and out across the continental shelf. Measurements were made using a Neil Brown 'Smart' CTD. On each day of sampling, ~6 stations were chosen across the shelf, with the CTD recorder measuring salinity, temperature and sigma-T through the water column.\n\nThis record describes CTD data collected in 1991. For each day of sampling three resources are provided in the compressed (zipped) folder: 1) A map showing the location of each sampling station, 2) A word document providing vertically averaged CTD data over depth bins of 4m, and 3) An excel file providing the raw CTD data collected, as well as coordinates of the stations.\n\nThis is one of nine child records that relate to the parent, 13391430-2ae8-11dd-a735-00188b4c0af8. A pdf outlining the structure and hierarchy of all metadata records relating to this project is available to download through this record. Also available is a pdf of a published working paper documenting this experiment and the results.",

    "title": "North West Margin Transects : Cruise Proposal",
    "description": "The North West Margin Transects Cruise is part of a program being undertaken by AGSO to determine the structural architecture of the north-western margin of Australia and the influence of structuring on the location, migration and trapping ofhydrocarbons in the region. An important aspect of this program is the acquisition ofa series of full margin 'dip' transects extending from unrifted cratonic basement tobeyond the continent-ocean boundary, and at least two 'strike' transects that willextend along the full length of the shelf from the eastern Timor Sea to North WestCape. The major objective of the proposed cruise is to extend previous AGSO deepseismic surveys across the Browse (Survey 119), offshore Canning (SNOWS-3/Survey 120) and northern Carnarvon Basins (SNOWS-/Survey 101, SNOWS-2/Survey 110) to complete these margin transects. Specific objectives of theproposed survey are:\n*Determine the regional structural framework of the Scott Plateau area and itsrelationship to adjacent features such as the Argo Abyssal Plain, the BrowseBasin and the Rowley Sub-Basin of the offshore Canning Basin;\n*Determine the regional structural framework of the Exmouth Plateau and itsrelationship to adjacent features such as the Barrow-Dampier Sub-basin, and theArgo and Gascoyne Abyssal Plains.\n*Define the broad deep-crustal structure of the region and develop a modelexplaining the tectonic, subsidence and thermal history of the Scott Plateau andthe Exmouth Plateau in relation to the development of the continental margin andadjacent ocean basins.\n*Assess the effects of the deep crustal structures and their reactivation phases onthe development of known petroleum accumulations.\n\nTo address these objectives it is proposed that RV Rig Seismic be used to acquireabout 3276 km of deep crustal (16 second record length) multichannel seismic andother geophysical data along 9 transects across the outer margins of the Browse,offshore Canning and northern Carnarvon Basins. The survey will tie into the 1991SNOWS-1 (101), 1992 SNOWS-2 (110), 1993 Browse Basin (119) and SNOWS-3(120) surveys.\n\nYou can also purchase hard copies of Geoscience Australia data and other products at http://www.ga.gov.au/products-services/how-to-order-products/sales-centre.html",

The dataset contains laboratory analyses of chemistry and environmental tracers on surface water samples collected from a subset of perennial waterholes along Cooper Creek during two targeted field sampling campaigns. The processes undertaken to produce the dataset are described in the 'History' field of this metadata statement.\n\n\n## **Attribution** \nGeological and Bioregional Assessment Program\n\n\n## **History** \nThis dataset contains laboratory analyses of chemistry and environmental tracers on surface water samples collected from a subset of perennial waterholes along Cooper Creek during two targeted field sampling campaigns. Specific perennial waterholes targeted for water sampling were identified using a combination of spatial data (specifically the COO_Lakes_WH_WFS.shp dataset) to obtain accurate locations of perennial waterholes and cadastre data for both QLD and SA to identify the property associated with each waterhole. The sub-set of perennial waterholes sampled in this dataset were the waterholes that the GBA Program negotiated permission to access for sampling. Water samples were collected using a custom submersible electric pump and following strict sampling protocols using specialised sampling vessels depending on each sample type. The chemistry data includes general field and laboratory chemistry (i.e. pH, EC, alkalinity) as well as major and minor ions analysed using a combination of ion chromatography, inductively coupled plasma - optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES) and inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). Environmental tracer data contained in this dataset includes 222Rn, 2H, 18O, 87Sr/86Sr, He, Ne, Ar, Kr and Xe which were analysed using a range of specialised analytical equipment at a variety of laboratories.",

    "description": "A unique relationship exists between neighbouring males and females in the fiddler crab Uca capricornis. This experiment was designed to determine if males and females are unable to associate with multiple partners because their partners aggressively repel same-sex intruders. Experiments were conducted in the East Point Reserve, Darwin from November-January in 2002-2006. \n\n15 male-female pairs were located and the burrow of the male or the female (in a random order) was blocked. We tethered a size-matched same-sex or opposite sex intruder (in a random order) half way between the burrows. Once the focal individual emerged we documented whether it pushed or grappled (fought) with the intruder within 5 minutes. After each trail, we unblocked the burrow and allowed the pair to interact normally for 10 minutes before running the next trail. In this way we observed the reactions of both pair members to same- and opposite-sex intruders. Therefore for each pair, 4 experiments were undertaken: original female vs. intruder female, original female vs. intruder male, original male vs. intruder male, original male vs. intruder female.   \n\nThe results indicated that males and females were equally likely to respond aggressively to intruders of the same sex. Both were less likely  to fight intruders of the opposite sex.",

    "description": "This data was collected in June 2008 by the IMOS Ship of Opportunity Underway CO2 Measurement research group on RV Southern Surveyor (IMOS platform code: VLHJ) voyage ST022008.\n\nDeparted: \tSuva, Fiji, June 08, 2008\nArrived:  \tCairns, Queensland, June 18, 2008\n\nCO2 System Overview:\nThe fugacity of carbon dioxide (fCO2) in surface seawater was measured using a General Oceanics Inc. automated system (Model 8050; Pierrot et al 2009). Seawater is sprayed into an equilibration chamber and CO2 in the headspace gas equilibrates with the seawater. The headspace gas is pumped through a thermoelectric condenser followed by a nafion drying tube before flowing through a Licor 7000 non-dispersive infrared gas analyser used to measure the CO2 mole fraction (XCO2) of the dried air. The gas flow is stopped temporarily for the CO2 measurements, which are made at atmospheric pressure. A set of four CO2 standards that cover the range of CO2 values expected in the ocean are analysed about every four hours to calibrate the gas analyser. The standard gas concentrations are on the WMO-X2007 mole fraction scale for CO2-in-air. Atmospheric XCO2 (dry) is measured after the standards by pumping clean outside air from an intake on the forward mast of the ship. \n\nSeawater intake and ancillary data:\nThe seawater intake is located at about 5.5m depth in the bow of the ship. Sea surface salinity is measured using a thermosalinograph (Seabird Electronics SBE21) located next to the CO2 system. A remote temperature sensor (Seabird Electronics SBE 38) located at the intake is used to measure sea surface temperature (SST). The travel time between the intake and CO2 system is typically about 4 minutes with warming usually less than 0.6ºC. The thermosalinograph water is from the same intake, but the supply lines separate after the intake. A comparison of thermosalinograph and equilibrator temperature records shows the temperature difference in the two lines is generally less than 0.1ºC. The thermosalinograph water line travels outside the ship and is typically warmer than the equilibrator. The travel time in water line to the thermosalinograph is 2.5 minutes faster than to the equilibrator. \n\nMeteorological data, salinity, SST, and ships position and time are taken from the ships logging system. These parameters and the data quality are maintained by the Australian Marine National Facility.",

The data is presented in 2011 Local Government Area (LGA) boundaries and covers each fifth year for the years 2011 to 2031.\nThe Victoria in Future series is a projection of the ERP for LGAs and Victoria in Future Small Areas (VIFSA) for 2011 to 2031. Some data areas are available for individual years and some for every fifth year in the projection period. The first year for each dataset within the series is 2011. Where available, the latest Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) data is used for the years 2012 to 2015.\nData are available for Estimated Resident Population (ERP - the official total population), population by age and sex (for single years of age in some cases, otherwise for five-year age groups), households and dwellings (including average household sizes and dwelling occupancy rates).\nVictoria in Future 2016 population projections are not predictions of the future, nor are they targets. They analyse changing economic and social structures and other drivers of demographic trends to indicate possible future populations if the present identified demographic and social trends continue. Projections are based exclusively on demographic components at the state and regional level, while local level projections take account of current and future land use, dwelling capacity, and development opportunities in addition to local demographic factors.\nFor more information please visit the DELWP VIF Portal.\nNotes: \n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data.\n\n\nThese detailed projections replace the projections published in Victoria in Future 2015 (based on the 2011 Census) issued by the Department of Transport, Planning and Local Infrastructure (DTPLI).\n\n\nThe base year for the calculation of VIF2016 projections is 2015 (as at 30 June), the most recent year for which the ABS has published the Estimated Resident Population (ERP) for both Victoria and for LGAs.\n\n\nThe data tables have been condensed to one dataset to allow longitudinal analysis of the data through year-period filters.\n\n",

    "description": "This dataset presents the footprint of the number of offences recorded on the Victoria Police Law Enforcement Assistance Program (LEAP). Recorded offences include any criminal act or omission by a person or organisation for which a penalty could be imposed by the Victorian legal system. The data spans the years ending March in the period of 2010 to 2019 and is aggregated to 2011 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS) Local Government Areas (LGA).\nThe CSA recorded crime collection includes all offences that are reported to, and detected by, Victoria Police and recorded on the LEAP database. The scope and coverage of the data, however, is not representative of all crime that occurs in Victoria. Some crimes may not be recorded on LEAP, not be reported to police, or the responsibility for responding to certain offences may lie with another agency. Recorded offence data are compiled on the basis of the date that the offence was created on the LEAP database, rather than the date the offence was detected by, or reported to police. The creation date may not be the date when the offence occurred, or the date when the offence came to the attention of police.\nFor further information about this dataset and related statistics, visit the data source:Crime Statistics Australia.\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data.\n\n\nRecorded crime statistics are based on data extracted by Victoria police on the 18th day after the reference period, and are subject to movement between releases.\n\n\nThe offences in the dataset are grouped according to the CSA offence classification.\n\n\nThe data excludes offences recorded at Justice institutions and immigration facilities, Unincorporated Victoria and where the geographic location is unknown or outside of Victoria.\n\n\nTo maintain confidentiality, sensitive offence counts for subdivisions 'A10 Homicide and related offences' and 'A30 Sexual offences' with a value of 1 to 3 are given a value of 2 to calculate totals.\n\n",

    "description": "This data was collected in July 2009 by the IMOS Ship of Opportunity Underway CO2 Measurement research group on RV Southern Surveyor (IMOS platform code: VLHJ) voyage SS032009.\n\nDeparted: \tLautoka Fiji, July 3, 2009\nArrived:  \tNoumea, New Caledonia, July 27, 2009\n\nCO2 System Overview:\nThe fugacity of carbon dioxide (fCO2) in surface seawater was measured using a General Oceanics Inc. automated system (Model 8050; Pierrot et al 2009). Seawater is sprayed into an equilibration chamber and CO2 in the headspace gas equilibrates with the seawater. The headspace gas is pumped through a thermoelectric condenser followed by a nafion drying tube before flowing through a Licor 7000 non-dispersive infrared gas analyser used to measure the CO2 mole fraction (XCO2) of the dried air. The gas flow is stopped temporarily for the CO2 measurements, which are made at atmospheric pressure. A set of four CO2 standards that cover the range of CO2 values expected in the ocean are analysed about every four hours to calibrate the gas analyser. The standard gas concentrations are on the WMO-X2007 mole fraction scale for CO2-in-air. Atmospheric XCO2 (dry) is measured after the standards by pumping clean outside air from an intake on the forward mast of the ship. \n\nSeawater intake and ancillary data:\nThe seawater intake is located at about 5.5m depth in the bow of the ship. Sea surface salinity is measured using a thermosalinograph (Seabird Electronics SBE21) located next to the CO2 system. A remote temperature sensor (Seabird Electronics SBE 38) located at the intake is used to measure sea surface temperature (SST). The travel time between the intake and CO2 system is typically about 4 minutes with warming usually less than 0.6ºC. The thermosalinograph water is from the same intake, but the supply lines separate after the intake. A comparison of thermosalinograph and equilibrator temperature records shows the temperature difference in the two lines is generally less than 0.1ºC. The thermosalinograph water line travels outside the ship and is typically warmer than the equilibrator. The travel time in water line to the thermosalinograph is 2.5 minutes faster than to the equilibrator. \n\nMeteorological data, salinity, SST, and ships position and time are taken from the ships logging system. These parameters and the data quality are maintained by the Australian Marine National Facility.",

This ensures a focus on the segment of the population most likely to be available for employment and excludes most people still engaged in post-school education. The data spans the year of 2006 and is aggregated to State Suburbs (SSC) from the 2006 Australian Standard Geographical Classification (ASGC).\nThis data has been created by the Grattan Institute for the Productive Cities: opportunity in a changing economy report, Kelly, J-F., Mares, P., Harrison, C., O'Toole, M., Oberklaid, M., Hunter, J., 2012, Productive Cities, Grattan Institute, ISBN:  978-1-925015-32-4.\nFor more information, please refer to the Productive Cities: opportunity in a changing economy report.",

    "description": "The Geofabric Surface Network product provides a set of related feature classes to be used as the basis for production of consistent hydrological surface stream network analysis. This product contains a topographically consistent representation of the (major) surface water features of Australia (excluding external territories). Primarily, these are natural surface hydrology features but the product also contains some man-made features (notably reservoirs and other hydrographic features). The Geofabric Surface Network product is based upon the input from ANUDEM Derived Streams V1.1.2 (ANUDEM Streams) which is the vectorised version of the nine second ANUDEM derived raster steams product. The product is related to, but distinct from, the stream network contained in the Geofabric Surface Cartography product. The network product represents the flow direction of streams over the surface of the terrain, based on the GEODATA Nine Second Digital Elevation Model (DEM-9S) Version 3. This product is more generalised than the Geofabric Surface Cartography and represents the main channels of the stream, particularly in areas where streams are heavily anabranched or disconnected. In addition, the stream connectivity represents a stream flow over the terrain, regardless of the presence of a corresponding Geofabric Surface Cartography stream segment. This means that the Geofabric Surface Cartography product may represent a stream as an interrupted or intermittent feature, whereas this product represents the same stream as a continuous connected feature. That is, the path that a stream would take (according to the terrain model) if sufficient water were available for flow. This product is fully topologically correct which means that all the stream segments flow in the correct direction. It also has full connectivity based on the flow of water across a terrain model. This product contains six feature types including: Waterbody, Network Stream, Network Node, Catchment, Network Connectivity (Upstream) and Network Connectivity (Downstream).",

Most SSPs have permanent enrolments and include schools for students with intellectual (mild, moderate and severe) and physical disabilities, visual or hearing impairment, behaviour disorders or emotional disturbance, and students in juvenile justice centres. Some SSPs have no permanent enrolments because the children temporarily attending them are enrolled and counted in their own schools.

    "description": "Argo Australia aims to undertake real time monitoring of the broad ocean state around Australia by maintaining an array of profiling (Argo) floats that measure temperature and salinity down to 2000m every 10 days in real time. This provides the essential and dominant in situ data stream for ocean and climate research and prediction/re-analyses.\n\nThe primary goal of the Argo program is to maintain a global array of autonomous profiling floats integrated with other elements of the climate observing system.\nThe specific aims are to:\n - detect climate variability over seasonal to decadal time-scales including changes in the large-scale distribution of temperature and salinity and in the transport of these properties by large-scale ocean circulation.\n - provide information needed for the calibration of satellite measurements.\n - deliver data for the initialization and constraint of climate models.\n\nArgo Australia is the third largest contributer to the global array (in terms of instrument numbers) after the Us and Japan.\n\nTo ensure 50% of the minimum design coverage of 1 float every 3 x3 degrees of latitude/longitude in the Australian region (i.e. between 90oE to 18oE, equator to Antarctic) requires deployment of 60 floats per year with the balance derived from international partners. The NCRIS investment along with currently identified Australian partners will provide for ~ 75 % of this requirement with further opportunities for co-investment. \n\nWork is underway to equip 30 floats per annum with oxygen sensors to address carbon cycle and biogeochemical cycling (BGC) variability in the Southern Ocean which is a significant component of the world climate and carbon cycling system. Additional investment would be required for this to occur.",

    "description": "The <strong>Climate Vulnerability Assessment</strong> was designed to provide an overview of the impact of future climate change on all stages of production for the commodities and biosecurity risks assessed. The project used multicriteria analysis (MCA) models to produce assessments for the commodities and biosecurity risks in a consistent and comparable way, and a framework was developed to provide a rigorous, flexible and transparent process for assessing vulnerabilities and opportunities to climate change. Details of the approach and the climate data used in the assessments can be found in the <a href=\"https://www.dpi.nsw.gov.au/dpi/climate/climate-vulnerability-assessment/publications-and-reports\">Methodology Report</a> which also details model exclusions and assumptions.\n\nAssessments were undertaken on commodities grouped into 6 nodes: <em>Horticulture and Viticulture</em>, <em>Broadacre Cropping</em>, <em>Forestry</em>, <em>Extensive Livestock</em>, <em>Marine Fisheries</em>, as well as for a set of biosecurity risks related to these primary industry sectors. The <a href=\"https://www.dpi.nsw.gov.au/dpi/climate/climate-vulnerability-assessment/publications-and-reports\">Summary Report</a> gives details of the chosen commodities and biosecurity risks and summarises the high-level results.\n\nResults Reports for each commodity and biosecurity risk are being released. Visit the <a href=\"https://www.dpi.nsw.gov.au/dpi/climate/climate-vulnerability-assessment\">project's web pages</a> to access these reports and for further information.\n\nThis dataset contains maps of modelled climate suitability for the <strong>irrigated maize</strong> model in the Broadacre Cropping node of the DPIRD Climate Vulnerability Assessment. Maps are provided (in GeoTIFF format) for each element of the model: the overall climate suitability, climate suitability maps for each phenophase and also for each phenophase/climate variable combination in the model. Data is provided for each of the eight global climate models (GCMs) used in the project, as well as the climate suitability derived from historical observations, along with the ensemble median for each map.",
