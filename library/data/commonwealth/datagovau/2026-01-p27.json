The survey asks employees about experiences with their own work and working with their team, managers and the organisation. The public sector includes a wide range of services relating to health, education, transport, justice, family support, finance, planning, the environment, and many other areas. Employees provide services directly to the public or work behind the scenes in research, policy, programs, clerical, corporate, or other types of jobs.\nThe survey was co-ordinated by the Public Service Commission working in collaboration with public sector departments and agencies.",

    "description": "Please Note: As announced by the Minister for Immigration and Border Protection on 25 June 2017, the Department of Immigration and Border Protection (DIBP) retired the paper-based Outgoing Passenger Cards (OPC) from 1 July 2017. The information previously gathered via paper-based outgoing passenger cards is now be collated from existing government data and will continue to be provided to users. Further information can be accessed here: http://www.minister.border.gov.au/peterdutton/Pages/removal-of-the-outgoing-passenger-card-jun17.aspx.\r\n\r\nDue to the retirement of the OPC, the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) undertook a review of the OAD data based on a new methodology. Further information on this revised methodology is available at: http://www.abs.gov.au/AUSSTATS/abs@.nsf/Previousproducts/3401.0Appendix2Jul%202017?opendocument&tabname=Notes&prodno=3401.0&issue=Jul%202017&num=&view= \r\n\r\nA sampling methodology has been applied to this dataset. This method means that data will not replicate, exactly, data released by the ABS, but the differences should be negligible.\r\n\r\nDue to ‘Return to Source’ limitations, data supplied to ABS from non-DIPB sources are also excluded.\r\n\r\nOverseas Arrivals and Departures (OAD) data refers to the arrival and departure of Australian residents or overseas visitors, through Australian airports and sea ports, which have been recorded on incoming or outgoing passenger cards. OAD data describes the number of movements of travellers rather than the number of travellers. That is, multiple movements of individual persons during a given reference period are all counted.\r\nOAD data will differ from data derived from other sources, such as Migration Program Outcomes, Settlement Database or Visa Grant information.\r\nTravellers granted a visa in one year may not arrive until the following year, or may not travel to Australia at all. Some visas permit multiple entries to Australia, so travellers may enter Australia more than once on a visa.\r\nSettler Arrivals includes New Zealand citizens and other non-program settlers not included on the Settlement Database. The Settlement Database includes onshore processed grants not included in Settler Arrivals.\r\n\r\nThese de-identified statistics are periodically checked for privacy and other compliance requirements. The statistics were temporarily removed in March 2024 in response to a question about privacy within the emerging technological environment. Following a thorough review and risk assessment, the Department of Home Affairs has republished the dataset.\r\n",

Tally focuses on trapdoor species with open burrows (no lid), that are more easily seen. A 20-minute area search method was used, with the observer walking slowly, looking at the ground, recording any burrows seen (usually within 2m of the observer). A metric ruler is used to measure the diameter of a sub-sample of burrows.\n\n<strong><em>Note: to access the data, select the data source link located on the right-hand side.</em></strong>",

It builds upon previous studies, particularly the 2021 Floodplain Risk Management Study (FRMS), and integrates lessons from the catastrophic 2022 flood events.\n\nThe FRMS study area comprises the urban areas of North Lismore, South Lismore, Central Lismore, and East Lismore. \n\nThe objective of the Lismore Flood Risk Management Plan (FRMP) is to provide a short- to medium-term strategy for managing flood risk in the Lismore Township. Specifically, the plan aims to:\n\nEstablish a comprehensive program of works and measures to progressively reduce the social, environmental, and economic impacts of flooding, supported by a clear implementation and funding framework.\n\nRecommend updates to Council policies and planning instruments to ensure that future development on flood-affected land is compatible with identified flood hazards and risks.\n\nReview and improve existing flood management practices, including the operation of key hydraulic controls and natural floodplain features, to enhance flood mitigation outcomes.\n\nEnsure alignment with local emergency management planning, supporting effective flood response and evacuation strategies.\n\nSecure community support and engagement, ensuring that the FRMP reflects local values, experiences, and priorities in flood risk management.",

    "description": "The Stocky Galaxias (Galaxias tantangara Raadik 2014) is a newly described species with few museum specimens. The name ‘tantangara’ is taken from the small alpine stream from which the first specimens were collected, a tributary of the upper Murrumbidgee River draining from Mount Tantangara. The species is only known from one locality, the headwaters of Tantangara Creek, upstream of the Tantangara Reservoir, NSW. It is restricted to a small creek above a waterfall, approximately 4 km from the source. \nThe Stocky Galaxias is a small fish named after its distinctly stocky body. It is recorded to grow to 103mm long and 13g in weight, but is more commonly 75-85 mm long. The body is predominantly dark olivebrown on the back and upper sides above the lateral line, becoming lighter to cream ventrally. Individuals possess many dark brown to almost black spots and flecks that may vary in size, found along the body, head and snout. The fins are translucent dusky grey and the gill covers are translucent. It has a long anal fin, short nostrils and an upper jaw that is slightly longer than the lower jaw. \nThey are a critically endangered species -\nhttps://www.dpi.nsw.gov.au/fishing/species-protection/whatcurrent/critically/stocky-galaxias.\nAs this species only occurs in one locality, the 2018 NSW Hydroline was used for its indicative distribution.",

Monitoring and evaluation was focused in seven Selected Areas: the Junction of the Warrego and Darling rivers, Gwydir river system, Lachlan river system, Murrumbidgee river system, Edward/Kolety-Wakool river system, Goulburn River and Lower Murray River. These areas will continue to be monitored through the CEWO’s Monitoring, Evaluation and Research (MER) Program.  \r\n\r\nData collected by monitoring at Selected Areas is used to evaluate local outcomes from watering and also contributed to the analysis and evaluation of Basin Plan objectives.\r\n\r\nVegetation diversity data was collected and used over the duration of the LTIM Project from 2014-15 to 2018-19 from four wetland Selected Areas (Gwydir, Lachlan, Murrumbidgee and junction of Warrego-Darling river systems) and two riverine Selected Areas (Edward/Kolety-Wakool and Goulburn river systems), considering plant species diversity and vegetation community diversity. \r\n\r\nData collected* includes the percent cover of plant species present within three vegetation strata (groundlayer, understorey and overstorey) and a range of environmental variables (e.g. soil moisture) at time of sampling. \r\n\r\n*Data collected from the Edward/Kolety-Wakool river system is limited to Category 3 and does not have the same taxonomic resolution or range of observations as that from other Selected Areas. \r\n\r\nPlease refer to the Murray-Darling Basin LTIM Project: 2018-19 Basin-scale evaluation of Commonwealth environmental water – Vegetation Diversity Report for the detailed method on data used for evaluation.  \r\n\r\n###Acknowledgement\r\n\r\nThe Commonwealth Environmental Water Office acknowledge the First Nations peoples as the Traditional Owners and Custodians of the lands, waterways and skies of the Murray-Darling Basin. We thank them for their knowledge and science and respect their continuing connection to culture and Country and the values reflected in these data.\r\n\r\n",

    "description": "This release consists of flux tower measurements of the exchange of energy and mass between the surface and the atmospheric boundary-layer using eddy covariance techniques. Data were processed using PyFluxPro (v3.4.17) as described by Isaac et al. (2017). PyFluxPro produces a final, gap-filled product with Net Ecosystem Exchange (NEE) partitioned into Gross Primary Productivity (GPP) and Ecosystem Respiration (ER).\n\nThe site is located on a low lying plain dominated by Mitchell Grass (<em>Astrebla</em> spp.). Elevation of the site is close to 250&nbsp;m and mean annual precipitation at a nearby Bureau of Meteorology site is 640&nbsp;mm. Maximum temperatures range from 28.4&nbsp;°C (in June/ July) to 39.1&nbsp;°C (in December), while minimum temperatures range from 11.2&nbsp;°C (in July) to 24.4&nbsp;°C (in December).\n\nThe instrument mast is 5&nbsp;m tall. Heat, water vapour and carbon dioxide measurements are taken using the open-path eddy flux technique. Temperature, humidity, wind speed, wind direction, rainfall and net radiation are measured. Soil heat fluxes are measured and soil moisture content is gathered using time domain reflectometry.\n\nAncillary measurements taken at the site include LAI, leaf-scale physiological properties (gas exchange, leaf isotope ratios, nitrogen and chlorophyll concentrations), vegetation optical properties and soil physical properties. Airborne based remote sensing (Lidar and hyperspectral measurements) was carried out at the site in September 2008. Biomass harvest measured: mean live biomass 0.00&nbsp;gm-2 (standard error: 0.00), mean standing dead biomass 163.42&nbsp;gm-2 (standard error: 16.73), mean litter biomass 148.99&nbsp;gm-2 (standard error: 21.32), total mean biomass 312.40&nbsp;gm-2 (standard error: 30.80). Soil consists of: clay 14.47%, silt 51.23%, sand 34.30%.",

    "description": "The association of FRB 200428 with the Galactic magnetar SGR 1935+2154 confirms that magnetars can power fast radio bursts (FRBs). However, FRB 200428 is 4 to 8 orders of magnitude less energetic than the typical population of cosmological FRBs. This discrepancy is likely due to the moderate magnetic field strength and evolved age of SGR 1935+2154. In contrast, newborn extragalactic magnetars, such as those formed in gamma-ray burst (GRB) central engines, are expected to have much stronger magnetic fields, more rapid spin-down, and highly dynamic magnetospheres, all of which favor the production of brighter and more frequent FRBs.\n\nWe propose a targeted search for FRBs from the recently localized GRB 230307A, a long-duration GRB with evidence suggesting the formation of a young magnetar. Given the source's relatively close distance (291 Mpc) and possible youth (less than 3 years), it offers a compelling opportunity to test FRB generation mechanisms during the early evolution of a magnetar.\n\nWe request 30 hours of observing time with the Parkes 64-m Murriyang telescope using the ultra-wideband low-frequency (UWL) receiver. Our plan includes one 10-hour long-duration session to detect rare or clustered bursts, and ten 2-hour sessions spread over 2-3 months to sample temporal variability. Data will be processed with state-of-the-art pipelines for single-pulse searches and coherent dedispersion.\n\nA detection would strongly support magnetar-origin FRB models and provide key constraints on the early-time activity of GRB-formed neutron stars.",

    "description": "This dataset is an output of the  Pilbara Marine Conservation Partnership (PMCP). Environmental Pessures Theme - Project Habitats and Biodiversity Characterisation and Mapping.  The benthic invertebrate, plant and fish biodiversity of the west Pilbara region was sampled between 10 and 27 June 2013 during voyages on the CSIRO vessel RV Linnaeus and WA Fisheries vessel RV Naturaliste. The equipment used was:\n0.75m epibenthic sled at 13 sites for a distance of ~300m or a\n1.5m epibenthic sled at 98 sites for a distance of ~150m per tow; \na Pipe dredge attached to each sled;\nan 8 Fathom Florida Flyer Trawl at 43 sites for a distance of ~1km per tow;\nand a Drop-Camera video system towed for a 500 m transect at 123 sites to observe and record video of the seabed habitat. Continuous underway coding during Drop-camera transects recorded cover of 9 substratum types, 25 biohabitat types, and occurrence of 14 faunal classes.\n\nThe results for the Sled and Trawl are presented as biomass per area swept by the gear (kg per ha).  \n\nDuring the Voyage Biota collected using the Sled and Trawl were sorted into 26 broad taxonomic categories from each tow (samples). These  were photographed, weighed, preserved and retained for identification.\nLarge biota such as turtles and seasnakes were measured, counted, weighed (or weight estimated), photographed and returned to the ocean alive.\nNon-living rocks/shells were photographed and weighed as a category called trash and returned to the ocean.\n\nThe following groups were retained and identified by taxonomists and voucher specimens curated at WA Museum:\nMarine Plants;\nSponges;\nCorals;\nCrustaceans;\nEchinoderms;\nMolluscs;\nand Fishes\n - many sponges were collected and require microscopic examination for identification - processing is expected to be complete mid 2016.\n\nThe following groups were retained with no facility for further identification as part of this project, and are currently at CSIRO Oceans and Atmosphere WA:\nAscidians - samples separated into colonial and solitary preserved in formalin;\nBrachiopoda - Frozen;\nBryozoa - Frozen;\nHydroids - Frozen;\nMiscellaneous - Frozen;\nWorms - Formalin.\n\nA pipe-dredge was attached to the sled to collect sediment samples: a 500 ml subsample was retained.\n\nThe Pilbara Marine Conservation Partnership (PMCP) was an initiative designed to enhance the net conservation benefits of the globally-significant coral reef ecosystems of the Pilbara (Western Australia) by providing an assessment of the condition and trajectory of key ecological values. These assessments were designed to inform and complement existing governance and management arrangements and the PMCP is intended to provide ongoing advice and assessment for conservation efforts in the region, providing lasting benefits.\nThe PMCP concept is based on three core ecological components, namely: \nCoral Reef Health - concentrating mainly on habitat forming primary producers.\nFish and Sharks - their community structure, interactions and impacts on lower trophic levels.\nEnvironmental Pressures - physical and anthropogenic factors that influence the condition of reefs",

    "title": "WAMSI Node 3.2.2c - Spatial variation in algal-herbivore interactions on the Ningaloo Reef, Western Australia: Regional differences in the piscine drivers of macroalgal herbivory in a coral-reef marine park (Honours thesis)",
    "description": "The process of herbivory is particularly intense in coral-reef ecosystems, where herbivorous fishes play a key role in promoting the resilience of coral reefs by mediating competition between corals and benthic macroalgae. Understanding and quantifying the species-specific roles of herbivores in ecosystem processes is critical for the proactive management of coral-reef systems, particularly in the context of their ability to overcome disturbance. \nThis study investigated variation in herbivory on macroalgae by coral-reef fishes at small (within-reef; &lt;1 km) and broad (regional; 50-300 km) spatial scales at Ningaloo Reef in north-west Western Australia.\nThe levels of herbivory by fishes significantly differed between regions of Ningaloo Reef and were shown to be similar to those at lower latitudes of the Great Barrier Reef. No differences in herbivory were evident at the smaller within-reef spatial scale, with herbivory instead being highly variable between successive sampling days. Using stationary high-definition video cameras to film the removal of transplanted macroalgal assays by fishes, the species responsible for the patterns of herbivory were also identified and their bite rate quantified. Seven fish species, namely Naso unicornis (f: Acanthuridae), Kyphosus sp., K. vaigiensis (f: Kyphosidae), Siganus doliatus (f: Siganidae), Scarus ghobban, S. schlegeli and initial-phase Scarus sp. (f: Scaridae), accounted for 95% of the 32,395 bites on the macroalgal assays across regions. However, analyses demonstrated that only the bites of N. unicornis, Kyphosus sp., and K. vaigiensis removed significant macroalgal biomass, indicating the functional inability of many other species to rapidly remove fleshy macroalgae from the reef. Together, the feeding of these three ‘macroalgal browsers’ accounted for more than 75% of the quantified variability in herbivory, essentially making these species the ‘drivers’ of macroalgal herbivory in Ningaloo Reef. Regions exhibiting similar levels of herbivory were characterised by different feeding species, indicating some degree of functional redundancy within Ningaloo Reef. However, the potential for this redundancy appears to be limited, given the process of macroalgal herbivory was effectively confined to only three out of the 31 roving ‘herbivorous’ fish species observed throughout this study. The disproportionate effects of these three herbivorous fish species could not be inferred by visual presence alone, as these three dominant species only comprised 1-7% of the herbivorous fish biomass across regions, thus highlighting that the species critical to the healthy functioning and resilience of coral-reef systems may go unnoticed using standard visual census techniques alone. The differential roles of species in the removal of macroalgae from the reef stress the necessity to evaluate roles in ecosystem processes at the species level. Given the exclusivity of the role in macroalgal herbivory to a select few species, this study also emphasises that a high diversity of herbivores may not necessarily offer a high level of resilience against a change in macroalgae cover in coral-reef systems.",

    "description": "This dataset presents the footprint of the number of installations of small generation unit (SGU) wind systems and their rated output in kilowatts (kW). The data spans the months of 2002 and includes the total for the year. The data is aggregated to Postal Areas (POAs) from the 2016 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nEvery month the Clean Energy Regulator (CER) publishes small-scale renewable energy installation data files. These data files provide a list of SGU (small-scale solar panel, wind and hydro systems) and kW capacity by installed postcode, and solar water heaters (SWH) and air source heat pumps by installed postcode. The data represents all systems that have had certificates validly created against them. The data includes new installations, upgrades to existing systems and stand-alone (off-grid) systems. This data is not publicly available via the Renewable Energy Certificate (REC) Registry and does not include systems that are pending registration or have been failed by the CER.\nFor further information about this dataset, visit the data source:Clean Energy Regulator - Postcode Data for Small-scale Installations.\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data by joining the data with the 2016 ASGS POAs\n\n\nMonthly installation data is provided for months where an installation was registered.\n\n\nThe data is current as at 30-09-2018.\n\n\nRenewable Energy Target (RET) legislation allows a 12 month creation period for registered persons to create their certificates.\n\n\nSmall-scale technology certificates are calculated based on the life of the system. This differs for solar hot water heaters and small generation units (solar panels, wind and hydro). Further information can be found at theRenewable Energy Target FAQ.\n\n\nCapacity data has been revised to account for past data entry errors which caused significant inconsistencies. These systems were installed between 2001 and 2003. As a result of this revision, the cumulative installed capacity from 2004 onwards has reduced by 5.517MW.\n\n",

    "description": "This dataset presents the footprint of statistics related to the leading causes of death by sex. The reported statistics include cause of death, ranking, total deaths, crude rates, age-standardised rates and rate ratio. The data spans the period between 2012-2016 and is aggregated to 2017 Department of Health Primary Health Network (PHN) areas, based on the 2016 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nMortality Over Regions and Time (MORT) books are workbooks that contain recent deaths data for specific geographical areas, sourced from the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare (AIHW) National Mortality Database. They present various statistics related to deaths by all causes and leading causes of death by sex for each geographical area.\nFor further information about this dataset, visit the data source:Australian Institute of Health and Welfare - MORT Books.\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data using the Department of Health - PHN Areas.\n\n\nCause of Death Unit Record File data are provided to the AIHW by the Registries of Births, Deaths and Marriages and the National Coronial Information System (managed by the Victorian Department of Justice) and include cause of death coded by the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS). The data are maintained by the AIHW in the National Mortality Database.\n\n\nYear refers to the year of registration of death. Deaths registered in 2013 and earlier are based on the final version of the cause of death data; deaths registered in 2014 are based on revised version; deaths registered in 2015 and 2016 are based on preliminary versions. Revised and preliminary versions are subject to further revision by the ABS.\n\n\nCause of death information are based on the underlying cause of death and are classified according to the International Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD). Deaths registered in 1997 onwards are classified according to the 10th revision (ICD-10).\n\n\nUnknown/missing includes deaths where place of usual residence was overseas, no fixed abode, offshore and migratory, and undefined.\n\n\nPopulation counts are based on estimated resident populations at 30 June for each year. Australian estimated resident population data are sourced from Australian demographic statistics (ABS cat. no. 3101.0).\n\n",

    "description": "The Climate Vulnerability Assessment was designed to provide an overview of the impact of future climate change on all stages of production for the commodities and biosecurity risks assessed. The project used multicriteria analysis (MCA) models to produce assessments for the commodities and biosecurity risks in a consistent and comparable way, and a framework was developed to provide a rigorous, flexible and transparent process for assessing vulnerabilities and opportunities to climate change. Details of the approach and the climate data used in the assessments can be found in the Methodology Report (https://www.dpi.nsw.gov.au/dpi/climate/climate-vulnerability-assessment/publications-and-reports) which also details model exclusions and assumptions.\nAssessments were undertaken on commodities grouped into 6 nodes:\n    Horticulture and Viticulture, Broadacre Cropping, Forestry, Extensive Livestock, Marine Fisheries\nas well as on a set of biosecurity risks related to these primary industry sectors. The Summary Report (https://www.dpi.nsw.gov.au/dpi/climate/climate-vulnerability-assessment/publications-and-reports) gives details of the chosen commodities and biosecurity risks and summarises the high-level results.\nResults Reports for each commodity and biosecurity risk are being released. Visit the project's web page to access these reports and for further information: https://www.dpi.nsw.gov.au/dpi/climate/climate-vulnerability-assessment.\nThis dataset contains maps of modelled climate suitability for the forestry node of the DPIRD Climate Vulnerability Assessment; the only commodity in this node is Radiata pine. Maps are provided for each element of the model: the overall climate suitability, climate suitability maps for each phenophase and also for each phenophase/climate variable combination contained in the model. Data is provided for each of the eight global climate models used in the project, as well as the climate suitability derived from historical observations.",

    "description": "Data were collected as part of the FutureReef MAP project, a three-year project designed to monitor ocean chemistry along the entire length of the Great Barrier Reef. The Future Reef MAP project is funded by Rio Tinto Alcan and administered by the Great Barrier Reef Foundation, with an equal co-investment by CSIRO. The project is the first large-scale CO2 observing system established on the Great Barrier Reef using the Rio Tinto ship, RTM Wakmatha. The research is targeted at providing information on the CO2 uptake and the controls on ocean acidification change in the region. It is providing foundation data needed to assess the vulnerability of the GBR reefs to ocean acidification. This dataset contains quality controlled underway measurements of the fugacity of CO2, atmospheric pressure, and sea surface temperature and salinity. The data management and distribution of these data were supported by the CSIRO Carbon Collaboration Cluster and the Australian Coastal Ecosystem Facility.",

    "title": "Preliminary note on Howard Springs radioactive prospect",
    "description": "Howards Springs are situated about 3.5 miles north-east of a point on the Stuart highway about 16 miles south of Darwin. They are seepage springs on a branch of the Howard River. Radioactive material was found in the area by Mr. L. Good, Box 273, Darwin, during October, and samples were sent to Rum Jungle for testing. A brief inspection of the area was made by the writer and Dr. N.H. Fisher on 7th November, 1952. It seems likely that the mineral causing radioactivity has been precipitated, probably by organic matter, from the spring water in the black clay layer, but the original source of the material is not at present clear.",

    "description": "The 2015-16 Budget is officially available at [budget.gov.au](http://www.data.gov.au) as the authoritative source of Budget Papers and Portfolio Budget Statement (PBS) documents. This dataset is a collection of data sources from the 2015-16 Budget, including:\r\n\r\n* The Portfolio Budget Statement Excel spreadsheets – Available after PBSs tabled in the Senate (~8.30pm Budget night).\r\n* A Machine Readable CSV of all PBS Excel Spreadsheet Line Items – Available after PBSs tabled in the Senate and translated (~8.30pm Budget night).\r\n\r\nData from the 2015-16 Budget are provided to assist those who wish to analyse, visualise and programmatically access the 2015-16 Budget. \r\n\r\nData users should refer to footnotes and memoranda in the original files as these are not usually captured in machine readable CSVs.\r\n\r\nWe welcome your feedback and comments below.\r\n\r\nThis dataset was prepared by the Department of Finance and the Department of the Treasury.\r\n\r\n##Information about the PBS Excel files and CSV##\r\n\r\nThe PBS Excel files published should include the following financial tables with headings and footnotes. Only the line item data (table 2.2) is available in CSV at this stage. Much of the other data is also available in the Budget Papers 1 and 4 in aggregate form:\r\n\r\n* Table 1.1: Entity Resource Statement;\r\n* Table 1.2: Entity 2015-16 Budget Measures;\r\n* Table 2.1: Budgeted Expenses for Outcome X;\r\n* Table 2.2: Programme Expenses and Programme Components.\r\n* Table 3.1.1: Movement of Administered Funds Between Years;\r\n* Table 3.1.2: Estimates of Special Account Flows and Balances;\r\n* Table 3.1.3: Australian Government Indigenous Expenditure (AGIE);\r\n* Tables 3.2.1 to 3.2.6: Departmental Budgeted Financial Statements; and\r\n* Tables 3.2.7 to 3.2.11: Administered Budgeted Financial Statements.\r\n\r\nPlease note, total expenses reported in the CSV file ‘2015-16 PBS line items dataset’ was prepared from individual entity programme expense tables. Totalling these figures does not produce the total expense figure in ‘Table1: Estimates of General Government Expenses’ (*Statement 6, Budget Paper 1*). \r\n\r\nDifferences relate to:\r\n\r\n1. Intra entity charging for services which are eliminated for the reporting of general government financial statements;\r\n2. Entity expenses that involve revaluation of assets and liabilities are reported as other economic flows in general government financial statements; and\r\n3. Additional entities’ expenses are included in general government sector expenses (e.g. Australian Strategic Policy Institute Limited and other entities) noting that only entities that are directly government funded are required to prepare a PBS.\r\n\r\nThe original PBS Excel files and published documents include sub-totals and totals by entity and appropriation type which are not included in the line item CSV. These can be calculated programmatically. Where modifications are identified they will be updated as required. \r\n\r\nIf a corrigendum to an entities PBS is issued after budget night, tables will be updated as necessary.\r\n\r\nThe structure of the line item CSV is;\r\n\r\n* Portfolio\r\n* Department/Entity\r\n* Outcome\r\n* Program\r\n* Expense type\r\n* Appropriation type\r\n* Description\r\n* 2014-15\r\n* 2015-16\r\n* 2016-17\r\n* 2017-18\r\n* 2018-19\r\n* Source document\r\n* Source table\r\n* URL\r\n\r\nThe data transformation is expected to be complete by midday 13 May.  We may put up an incomplete CSV which will continue to be updated as additional PBSs are transformed into data form.\r\n\r\nThe following Portfolios are included in the line item CSV: \r\n\r\n* Agriculture\r\n* Attorney General's\r\n* Communications\r\n* Defence\r\n* Education and Training \r\n* Employment\r\n* Environment\r\n* Finance\r\n* Foreign Affairs and Trade\r\n* Health\r\n* Human Services\r\n* Immigration and Border Protection\r\n* Industry and Science\r\n* Infrastructure and Regional Development\r\n* Parliamentary Departments\r\n* Prime Minister and Cabinet\r\n* Social Services\r\n* Treasury\r\n* Veterans' Affairs\r\n\r\n##Budget Paper Tables##\r\n\r\nWe have made a number of data tables from the Budget Papers available in Excel and CSV formats.\r\n\r\nBelow is the list of the tables published and whether we’ve translated them into CSV form this year:\r\n\r\n* Budget Paper 1: Appendix A1 - Estimates of expenses by function and sub‑function\r\n* Budget Paper 1: Overview - Appendix C Major Intiatives\r\n* Budget Paper 1: Overview - Appendix D Major Savings\r\n* Budget Paper 1: Statement 3 - Table 7: Reconciliation of underlying cash balance estimates\r\n* Budget Paper 1: Statement 4 - Table 1: Australian Government general government receipts\r\n* Budget Paper 1: Statement 4 - Table 7: Australian Government general government (cash) receipts\r\n* Budget Paper 1: Statement 4 - Table 10: Reconciliation of 2015‑16 general government (accrual) revenue\r\n* Budget Paper 1: Statement 4 - Supplementary table 3: Australian Government (accrual) revenue\r\n* Budget Paper 1: Statement 10 - Table 1: Australian Government general government sector receipts, payments, net Future Fund earnings and underlying cash balance\r\n* Budget Paper 1: Statement 10 - Table 4: Australian Government general government sector taxation receipts, non‑taxation receipts and total receipts\r\n* Budget Paper 1: Statement 10 - Table 5: Australian Government general government sector net debt and net interest payments\r\n* Budget Paper 4 Table 1.1 – Agency Resourcing\r\n* Budget Paper 4 Table 1.2 – Special Appropriations\r\n* Budget Paper 4 Table 1.3 – Special Accounts\r\n* Budget Paper 4 Table 2.2 – Staffing Tables\r\n* Budget Paper 4 Table 3.1 – Departmental Expenses\r\n* Budget Paper 4 Table 3.2 – Net Capital Investment\r\n\r\n###Change Log###\r\n1. *22:30PM 12/05/2015* dataset first published\r\n2. *09:00 13/05/2015* machine readable csv updated to include data from National Museum of Australia, Australian Aged Care Quality Agency & Australian Institute of Family Studies.\r\n3. *15:30 13/05/2015* machine readable csv updated to include a column linking to resource file and fixed a few minor errors.\r\n4. *16:00 14/05/2015* have added several selected transformed tables from Budget Paper 4.\r\n5. *12:30 18/05/2015* several minor updates to CSV.\r\n6. *16:00 03/06/2015* added several machine readable Budget Paper 1 tables prepared by Department of the Treasury.",

    "description": "The Climate Vulnerability Assessment was designed to provide an overview of the impact of future climate change on all stages of production for the commodities and biosecurity risks assessed. The project used multicriteria analysis (MCA) models to produce assessments for the commodities and biosecurity risks in a consistent and comparable way, and a framework was developed to provide a rigorous, flexible and transparent process for assessing vulnerabilities and opportunities to climate change. Details of the approach and the climate data used in the assessments can be found in the Methodology Report which also details model exclusions and assumptions.\nAssessments were undertaken on commodities grouped into 6 nodes: Horticulture and Viticulture, Broadacre Cropping, Forestry, Extensive Livestock, Marine Fisheries, as well as for a set of biosecurity risks related to these primary industry sectors. The Summary Report gives details of the chosen commodities and biosecurity risks and summarises the high-level results.\nResults Reports for each commodity and biosecurity risk are being released. Visit the project's web pages to access these reports and for further information.\nThis dataset contains maps of modelled climate suitability for the citrus model in the Horticulture and Viticulture node of the DPIRD Climate Vulnerability Assessment. Maps are provided (in GeoTIFF format) for each element of the model: the overall climate suitability, climate suitability maps for each phenophase and also for each phenophase/climate variable combination in the model. Data is provided for each of the eight global climate models (GCMs) used in the project, as well as the climate suitability derived from historical observations, along with the ensemble median for each map.",

    "description": "This series comprises hydrographic charts held at Queensland State Archives were prepared by the Harbours and Rivers Department and its successors, as well as the British Admiralty, Royal Navy, Royal Australian Navy and the Australian Hydrographic Service. Initially, hydrographic charts of the [Queensland] coast were published by the British Admiralty, surveys having been undertaken by the Royal Navy. Australia's hydrographic service was subsequently formed on 1 October 1920 as a part of the Royal Australian Navy. The earliest items in this series dating from Flinders' 1802 Chart of Terra Australis, comprise copies of the Admiralty or Royal Navy charts.\nDetails recorded on hydrographic charts include regular water depth, positions and least depth over all shoals, wrecks, reefs, banks, etc, position of the coastline (HW and LW mark), nature of the bottom, leading lines fixed and sounded, tidal stream measurements and observations, navigation marks, lights and sailing directions, details of wrecks, etc.\nWhile the series provides an historical survey record of the Queensland coast and major rivers and bays, it includes charts current to year 2010, both new charts and resurveys or updates.\nIn addition to coastal hydrographic charts and charts of bay entrance channels and reach surveys for navigation purposes, the series includes hydrographic survey plans recording improvements or works in progress, for example, dredging, test bores, reclamation, siltation, wharfage or marina proposals. Some land drawings are also included, for example, port land use and facilities.\nThe charts are loose and while the majority are within A1/B1 size, they vary from small foolscap drawings up to 2A0 dimensions. Original drawings are linen, tracing paper or tracing film while copies are generally photo-sensitive film.",

    "description": "This release consists of flux tower measurements of the exchange of energy and mass between the surface and the atmospheric boundary-layer using eddy covariance techniques. Data were processed using PyFluxPro (v3.5.0) as described by Isaac et al. (2017). PyFluxPro produces a final, gap-filled product with Net Ecosystem Exchange (NEE) partitioned into Gross Primary Productivity (GPP) and Ecosystem Respiration (ER).\n\nThe Gingin site was established in June 2011 by CSIRO and is now managed by Edith Cowan University Centre for Ecosystem Management. The site is a natural woodland of high species diversity. The overstorey is dominated by <em>Banksia</em> spp. mainly <em>Banksia menziesii</em>, <em>Banksia attenuata</em>, and <em>Banksia grandis</em> with a height of around 7&nbsp;m and leaf area index of about 0.8. There are occasional stands of eucalypts and acacia that reach to 10&nbsp;m and have a denser foliage cover. There are many former wetlands dotted around the woodland, most of which were inundated all winter and some had permanent water 30 years ago. The watertable has now fallen below the base of these systems and they are disconnected and are no longer permanently wet. The fine sediments, sometimes diatomaceous, hold water and they have perched watertables each winter. There is a natural progression of species accompanying this process as they gradually become more dominated by more xeric species. The soils are mainly Podosol sands, with low moisture holding capacity. Field capacity typically about 8 to 10&nbsp;%; and in summer these generally hold less than 2&nbsp;% moisture. The water table is at about 8.5&nbsp;m below the surface, and a WA Dept of water long-term monitoring piezometer is near the base of the tower. The instrument mast is 14.8&nbsp;m tall, with the eddy covariance instruments mounted at 14.8&nbsp;m. Fluxes of carbon dioxide, water vapour and heat are quantified with open-path eddy covariance instrumentation. Ancillary measurements include temperature, air humidity, wind speed and direction, precipitation, incoming and outgoing shortwave radiation, incoming and outgoing long wave radiation, incoming total and diffuse PAR and reflected PAR. Soil water content and temperature are measured at six soil depths. Surface soil heat fluxes are also measured. A COSMOS Cosmic ray soil moisture instrument is installed, along with a logged piezometer, and nested piezometers installed with short screens for groundwater profile sampling. To monitor the watertable gradient, piezometers will be installed 500&nbsp;m east and west of the tower.  ",

    "description": "This dataset is a component of the 'Jervis Bay Baseline Studies' project conducted by the Department of Defence, CSIRO and the Australian Defence Force Academy.\n\nThe meteorological station (35.133S, 150.762E) recorded winds and atmospheric pressure at Governor Head (Jervis Bay). The site is several hundred metres inland of 50m high cliffs and is 63m above sea-level.\n\nThis record provides wind statistics for June 1989. Five datasets are included here representing different times of the day: 0000-0550, 0600-1150, 1200-1750 and 1800-2350. Individual measurements have been converted so that trends of wind speed and direction can be seen for the time period in question. The fifth dataset incorporates all the wind data collected irrespective of time providing a monthly summary. The station initially recorded wind data at 10 minute intervals.\n\nThis is one of thirty-six child records that relate to the parent, 629051e0-2b7b-11dd-a343-00188b4c0af8. A pdf outlining the structure and hierarchy of all metadata records relating to the 'Jervis Bay Baseline Studies' project is available to download through this record. Meteorological data was collected to investigate wind forced circulation in Jervis Bay, NSW.",

This is the traditional approach used for CARRS assessment in Australia and has been applied at the State scale (and is also applied nationally).\n\nThe outcome approach considers how irreplaceable each patch of habitat is, based on its contribution to the conservation of species (using vascular plants and vertebrates). All areas critical to the long-term conservation of one or more species of conservation concern are used to assess sufficiency and to set priorities for future protection and conservation. Due to data paucity, the current assessment was only able to encompass the agricultural zone of South Australia. Work has commenced that will enable the Statewide application of this approach, which will be captured in future updates.\n\nThis tabular output is designed to be joined to the LANDSCAPE.IbraSubregionAust70 spatial layer.",

The project linked closely with WAMSI 2 KMRP projects 2.2.1 and 2.2.2 to better understand how freshwater discharge influences marine food web structure and sustains the productivity of Kimberley inshore ecosystems. Oceanographic and biogeochemical data was collected over two field campaigns (October/November 2013 and April/May 2014) from the Walcott Inlet, Collier Bay area (16° 22.624’S 124° 26.235’E to 16° 24.487’S 124° 54.035’E) and models integrated with those for Collier Bay (KMRP Project 2.2.2).\nThis metadata relates to UWA component of study.

    "description": "The Acidification Moorings sub-facility is responsible for building an ocean carbon and acidification monitoring network for Australian waters. These moorings provide key observations to help us understand and address the problem of increasing ocean acidification. Each mooring is equipped with surface CO2 systems, using proven and robust technology. Three sensors will determine surface CO2, temperature and salinity. The hydrochemistry sampling at the National Reference Stations will also provide total alkalinity data, as will future pH sensors on the moorings, allowing for a complete determination of the carbonate system and pH. \n\nAcidification moorings are co-located at three National Reference Stations: * the Yongala NRS in Queensland (replaced in September 2013 after Tropical Cyclone Yasi, and then decommissioned in August 2014), * the Maria Island NRS in Tasmania, and * the Kangaroo Island NRS in South Australia. There is also one site located adjacent to the Heron Island reef slope in the Wistari channel on the Great Barrier Reef. The Yongala, Wistari and Maria Island acidification moorings are located to characterise changes down the east coast of Australia and the influence of the East Australian Current on CO2 uptake and acidification from the Great Barrier Reef to the Southern Ocean. The Kangaroo Island mooring monitors the deeper waters upwelled on the South Australian shelf which are expected to have higher CO2 and thus could accelerate the exposure of ecosystems to acidification earlier than in other regions.",

The role type designated to each road should represent the role that the road is intended to perform. It may not necessarily reflect the current conditions on the road. A total of six hierarchy types are used for roads in Western Australia. The Road Hierarchy provides a high level description of the hierarchy performed by roads in the network across WA. Road management is guided by the hierarchy type of each road.\nThis data presents the road hierarchy in Western Australia as of December 2017. AURIN took the data in August 2018.\nFor more information please visit the MRWA Open Data Portal.",

    "description": "Fish larvae counts from light traps and drift nets collected as part of the Commonwealth Environmental Water Office's (CEWO) Flow-MER program in the Murray-Darling Basin.\r\n\r\nSpawning of both native and introduced species was measured by collecting eggs and fish larvae using drift nets and light traps during the known spawning period at five Selected Areas (Edward/Kolety–Wakool River System, Goulburn River, Lachlan River System, Lower Murray River, Murrumbidgee River).\r\n\r\nBongo tow nets, rather than drift nets, were used to sample pelagic fish in the Lower Murray River due to very slow flow velocities.\r\n\r\nThe CEWO’s Flow-MER program examines the contribution of Commonwealth environmental water to the environmental objectives of the Basin Plan 2012 (Basin Plan) and is assisting the CEWO to demonstrate environmental outcomes and adaptively manage the water holdings. For more information and reporting using these data see https://www.dcceew.gov.au/water/cewo/monitoring/mer-program.\r\n\r\nThis Flow-MER data set includes and extends the long-term data collected at the same sites during the Long Term Intervention Monitoring (LTIM) project (2014-2019).\r\n\r\n###Acknowledgement\r\n\r\nThe Commonwealth Environmental Water Office and Flow-MER program acknowledge the First Nations peoples as the Traditional Owners and Custodians of the lands, waterways and skies of the Murray-Darling Basin. We respect their continuing connection to culture and Country, and we thank them for their knowledge and science and the values reflected in these data.\r\n\r\n###Citation\r\n\r\nCEWO (2024) Fish Fish Larvae.

    "description": "The Climate Vulnerability Assessment was designed to provide an overview of the impact of future climate change on all stages of production for the commodities and biosecurity risks assessed. The project used multicriteria analysis (MCA) models to produce assessments for the commodities and biosecurity risks in a consistent and comparable way, and a framework was developed to provide a rigorous, flexible and transparent process for assessing vulnerabilities and opportunities to climate change. Details of the approach and the climate data used in the assessments can be found in the Methodology Report which also details model exclusions and assumptions.\nAssessments were undertaken on commodities grouped into 6 nodes: Horticulture and Viticulture, Broadacre Cropping, Forestry, Extensive Livestock, Marine Fisheries, as well as for a set of biosecurity risks related to these primary industry sectors. The Summary Report gives details of the chosen commodities and biosecurity risks and summarises the high-level results.\nResults Reports for each commodity and biosecurity risk are being released. Visit the project's web pages to access these reports and for further information.\nThis dataset contains maps of modelled climate suitability for the Dolphinfish model in the Marine Fisheries node of the DPIRD Climate Vulnerability Assessment. Maps are provided (in GeoTIFF format) for each element of the model: the climate suitability for each month, climate suitability maps for each phenophase and also for each phenophase/climate variable combination in the model. Data is provided for each of the eight global climate models (GCMs) used in the project, as well as the climate suitability derived from historical observations, along with the ensemble median for each map.\nMaps are provided (in GeoTIFF format) for each element of the model: the climate suitability for each season, climate suitability maps for each phenophase and also for each phenophase/climate variable combination in the model. Data is provided for each of the five global climate models (GCMs) used for the Marine Fisheries node, as well as the climate suitability derived from historical observations, along with the ensemble median for each map.",

    "description": "The key objective of this Flood Study is to develop a suitable hydrologic/hydraulic model that\ncan project flood and permanent inundation water levels in Lake Macquarie from rainfall, sea\nlevel rise and storm surge. These results will be used by Lake Macquarie City Council, in\nconsultation with the community of Lake Macquarie City, to manage flood and permanent\ninundation risks to low lying land around the Lake Macquarie waterway.\nThe key stages in the process are:\nUndertaken a comprehensive review of the 1998 Lake Macquarie Flood Study (Part 1 –\nReference 1) and develop suitable hydrologic/hydraulic models to define flood behaviour\nover the full range of design events for existing catchment conditions,\nUse the hydrologic/hydraulic models to assess various climate change scenarios,\nincluding application of the NSW Government’s sea level rise benchmarks,\nAssess the potential increase in storm surge as a result of climate change and its impact\non elevated ocean levels,\nReview the potential impact of climate change on the local wind/wave climate as this\naffects the extent of wave runup on the foreshore,\nAssess the hydraulic and hazard categories for existing and climate change conditions.\nThis report details the results and findings of the above investigations. The key elements\ninclude:\na summary of available historical flood related data,\nestablishment of the hydrologic and hydraulic models,\ncalibration of the hydrologic and hydraulic models,\ndefinition of the design flood behaviour for existing catchment conditions,\nsensitivity analysis of the design flood behaviour,\nassessment of the impacts of climate change on the still water and wave runup water\nlevels\nre-definition of the flood extent and hydraulic and hazard categories mapping for existing\nand climate change conditions.\nA Flood Study is a technical document and not easily understood by the general public. A\nglossary of flood related terms is provided in Appendix A to assist. If more explanation of terms\nor a better understanding of the approach is required, type “NSW Government Floodplain\nDevelopment Manual” into an internet search engine and you will be directed to the NSW\nGovernment web site which provides a copy of this manual and further explanation.\nFlood levels given in this report relate only to the water level with the lake itself. Design water\nlevels in the creek systems entering the lake (Cockle Creek, Dora Creek etc.) will be higher than\nthose shown for the lake.",

    "description": "This dataset presents counts of payment recipients by payment type for the quarter ending September 2019. The data is based on the recipient's geocoded address aggregated by Local Government Area (LGA) from the Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS) 2018.\nThe Department of Social Services (DSS) is the Australian Government's lead agency in the development and delivery of social policy, and is working to improve the lifetime wellbeing of people and families in Australia. DSS' policies and services respond to need across people's lives - looking after families, children and older people; providing a safety net for people who cannot fully support themselves; enhancing the wellbeing of people with high needs; assisting people who need help with care; and supporting a diverse and harmonious society. DSS supports people and families in Australia by encouraging independence and participation, and supporting a cohesive society.\nFor more information on this dataset please visit the Australian Government Open Data.\nFor further details on payments, see 'A guide to Australian Government payments'.\nPlease note:\n\n\nIn order to protect individuals' privacy, identified populations between 1 and 4 have been suppressed and replaced with '&lt;5' for confidentiality purposes. Additional data may be suppressed and replaced with 'n.p.' (not provided) to prevent the derivation of identified populations that have values of less than 5.\n\n\nIndividuals who live overseas, individuals who are without a valid home address and individuals who only have a postal address cannot be assigned to a locational boundary. State/territory totals derived from Local Government Area data will not match actual state and territory totals, due to different statistical geography methodologies.\n\n\nCaveats specific to payments type can be found in the relevant payment description of the original data.\n\n\nAURIN has spatialised this dataset and have made the following replacements to enforce data type consistency: \n\n\n'&lt;5' has been assigned a value of '-1' within the data\n\n\nA boolean field has been created for each data field to flag left-censored data. 'True' is assigned to fields that have been censored.\n\n\n'n.p.' (not provided) has been set to Null within the data.\n\n",

    "description": "This dataset consists of measurements of the exchange of energy and mass between the surface and the atmospheric boundary-layer in lowland tropical rainforest at the Daintree Discovery Centre near Cow Bay in Far North Queensland, using eddy covariance techniques.   \nThe Cow Bay flux station was established in December 2008 and managed by James Cook University. The forest is classified as complex mesophyll vine forest, there are 94 species in the core 1Ha, and average tree height is 22m. Elevation of the site is 90m and mean annual precipitation is 3935mm. The Daintree Rainforest is one of the most biodiverse forests in Australia.The instruments are mounted on a walk-up tourist tower at 35m. Fluxes of heat, water vapour and carbon dioxide are measured using the open-path eddy flux technique. Supplementary measurements above the canopy include temperature, humidity, windspeed, wind direction, rainfall, incoming and reflected shortwave radiation and net radiation.The early years 2009 - 12 had several data gaps. Shadowing of the radiometric equipment continues to cause artifacts on the radiometers - these can be seen as reduction in downwelling radiation with solar inclination. The site is part of the FNQ Rainforest SuperSite - associated with the Daintree node, which is part of the TERN Australian SuperSite Network (ASN). \nFor additional site information, see https://supersites.tern.org.au/supersites/fnqr-daintree .

Each data row has two concentrations: one for grass (Poaceae) and one for all other pollen. For comparison with other data sets and between pollen seasons the data weeks start at July 1 each calendar year. Extra days at the end of the pollen year are included in week 52. Each data row has a collection period start date, the number of days within the collection period (7-9), and the number of days on which pollen was collected and summed (0-9). Concentrations represent only the number of days collected and not always the full collection period, as indicated.  \nAirborne pollen samples were collected using a volumetric continuous flow impaction sampler (Burkard Manufacturing, UK), stained with fuchsin and counted by light microscopy according to best practice described in the Australian Airborne Pollen and Spore Monitoring Network Interim Standard and Protocols (Version 2, 14 September 2018).\nData may be used for modelling and forecasting airborne grass, other, total pollen levels. Other uses include analysis of the effect of pollen levels on asthma and allergy presentations, or in inference of grass and other vegetation growth patterns. Data may also be used for evaluation of medium or long-term trends over time or comparison withpollen exposure levels between spatial distant locations.\nMetadata about this and other AusPollen Aerobiology Collaboration Network monitoring sites is provided on the National Environmental Monitoring Site Register. Information about other pollen and spores monitored can be found by the AusPollen Aerobiology Collaboration Network Species Classification on the ARDC Research Vocabularies site.\nAURIN has added latitude, longitude and spatialised geometry columns for each row based on the coordinates of the pollen samples. Periods over which no data is available are marked as null.",

    "description": "The digital State Boundaries and their legal identifiers have been derived from the cadastre data from each state and territory jurisdiction and are available below.\r\n\r\nState Boundaries are part of Geoscape Administrative Boundaries, which is built and maintained by  [Geoscape Australia](https://geoscape.com.au/) using authoritative government data. Further information about contributors to Administrative Boundaries is available [here](https://geoscape.com.au/legal/data-copyright-and-disclaimer/).\r\n\r\nThe full Administrative Boundaries dataset contains boundaries in seven themes: Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) boundaries, electoral boundaries, state and territory boundaries, local government areas, suburbs/localities, wards and town points.\r\n\r\nAs at November 2019, users have the option to download datasets with feature coordinates referencing the new Geocentric Datum of Australia 2020 (GDA2020) in addition to datasets on the GDA94 datum.\r\n\r\nFor GDA2020 datasets, the name of the zip folder and the root folder (once extracted) include a reference to GDA2020. For GDA94 datasets, the zip and root folder names do not contain the datum name (i.e. they remain the same as previous releases).\r\n\r\nFor example, the zip and root folder for Administrative Boundaries downloaded in GDA2020 for November 2019 looks like this:\r\n\r\n       •\tNOV19_AdminBounds_ESRIShapefileorDBFfile_GDA2020; or \r\n       •\tNOV19_AdminBounds_MapInfoTABFormat_GDA2020\r\n\r\nThe zip and root folder for Administrative Boundaries in GDA94 for November 2019 looks like this: \r\n\r\n       •\tNOV19_AdminBounds_ESRIShapefileorDBFfile; or \r\n       •\tNOV19_AdminBounds_MapInfoTABFormat\r\n\r\nIrrespective of the datum chosen, files within the respective folder use exactly the same naming structures.\r\n\r\nFurther information on Administrative Boundaries, including FAQs on the data, is available [here](https://geoscape.com.au/data/administrative-boundaries/) through Geoscape Australia’s network of [partners](https://geoscape.com.au/partners/).

    "description": "The overall aim of this project was to determine the geomorphological and sedimentary characteristics (biological and physical) of the Ningaloo Reef and shelf, and to identify evolutionary characteristics relevant to the maintenance of marine biodiversity. This included characterising reef growth history, coastal and seabed geomorphology, surficial sediment facies and their influence on the distribution of benthic habitats. This research presents an interdisciplinary study that provides an important baseline for future habitat mapping, biodiversity assessments, spatial planning, and fisheries management. The characterisation and mapping of benthic habitats based on physical parameters is central for the ongoing monitoring, management and conservation of the NMP’s inshore and offshore resources, particularly during a time of increasing anthropogenic and environmental pressures.",

The site at Governor head is several hundred metres inland of 50m high cliffs and is 63m above sea-level. The anemometer readings from Huskisson was run by the NSW Public Works Department.\n\nThis is one of thirty-six child records that relate to the parent, 629051e0-2b7b-11dd-a343-00188b4c0af8. A pdf outlining the structure and hierarchy of all metadata records relating to the 'Jervis Bay Baseline Studies' project is available to download through this record.

    "title": "Australian Soil Carbon Sequestration Potential, 2023",
    "description": "Soil is a huge carbon (C) reservoir, but where and how much extra C can be stored is unknown. Here, using 5089 observations, we estimated that the uppermost 30&nbsp;cm of Australian soil holds 13&nbsp;Gt (10–18&nbsp;Gt) of mineral-associated organic carbon (MAOC). Using a frontier line analyses, described in Viscarra Rossel et al. (2023), we estimated  the  maximum amounts of MAOC that Australian soils could store in their current environments, and calculated the MAOC deficit, or C sequestration potential. We propagated the uncertainties from the frontier fitting and mapped the estimates of these values over Australia using machine learning and kriging with external drift (KED). The maps show regions where the soil is more in MAOC deficit and has greater sequestration potential. The modelling shows that the variation over the whole continent is determined mainly by climate, linked to vegetation, and soil mineralogy. We find that the MAOC deficit in Australian soil is 40&nbsp;Gt (25–60&nbsp;Gt). The deficit in the vast rangelands is 20.84&nbsp;Gt (13.97–29.70&nbsp;Gt) and the deficit in cropping soil is 1.63&nbsp;Gt (1.12–2.32&nbsp;Gt). Our findings suggest that the C sequestration potential of Australian soil is limited by climate.",

The other HF ocean radar station is at Seabird.  The HF ocean radar coverage is from the coast to beyond the edge of the continental shelf. \n\nThe CRVT HF ocean radar is a SeaSonde crossed-loop direction finding array.  This radar operates at a frequency of 5.211 MHz, with a bandwidth of 50 KHz, a maximum range of 200 Km and a range resolution of 3 Km.  The antenna bearing is 288 deg true east of north (approximately west by north-west).\n\nWithin the HF radar coverage area surface current radials are measured.",

    "description": "This dataset describes habitat suitability for feral pig breeding and persistence in northern Australia during the dry season. It is the result of a spatially-explicit, resource-based and regional-scale habitat model that integrated expert knowledge on feral pig breeding requirements and home range movements as well as seasonal variability in environmental conditions.\r\n\r\nThe modelled habitat suitability index (HSI) can theoretically range between 0 and 100, with higher values indicating better habitat quality for feral pig breeding. Due to modelling methods and assumptions, HSI values in this dataset effectively range between 11 and 81. They can be broadly classified as follows: HSI ≥ 60 = highly suitable habitat; HSI ≥ 40 = moderately suitable habitat; HSI < 40 = unsuitable habitat.\r\n\r\nPredicted habitat suitability should not be confused with actual feral pig occurrence. Individuals may be sighted at any time in unsuitable breeding habitat. Conversely, suitable breeding habitat may remain unoccupied. While there is a link between habitat suitability and population density, this may not always be straightforward (i.e. comparable habitat may carry vastly different actual or potential densities depending on the nature and quality of available resources).\r\n\r\nFeral pig habitat suitability in northern Australia was modelled for two seasonal scenarios. The dry season scenario captured unfavourable conditions during the late dry season, when resources required by feral pigs are generally scarce and scattered across the region. It was developed using spatial proxies averaged across two months (October/November) over five years (2010 to 2014). Seasonal model results were validated against four independent distributional data sets.\r\n\r\nUnderlying model parameters were elicited from experts. This dataset represents results from an expert-averaged model run. The model contained a variable \"Disturbance stress\" for which no spatial proxies were available. In this dataset, we assumed a uniformly “high” intensity and frequency of control activities, which likely overestimated disturbance and may undervalue habitat suitability in situations where there is actually little management.\r\n\r\nA detailed description of modelling methods and assumptions is provided in Froese et al. 2017 (https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0177018).",

    "title": "Climate Vulnerability Assessment: Blueberry",
    "description": "The Climate Vulnerability Assessment was designed to provide an overview of the impact of future climate change on all stages of production for the commodities and biosecurity risks assessed. The project used multicriteria analysis (MCA) models to produce assessments for the commodities and biosecurity risks in a consistent and comparable way, and a framework was developed to provide a rigorous, flexible and transparent process for assessing vulnerabilities and opportunities to climate change. Details of the approach and the climate data used in the assessments can be found in the Methodology Report which also details model exclusions and assumptions.\nAssessments were undertaken on commodities grouped into 6 nodes: Horticulture and Viticulture, Broadacre Cropping, Forestry, Extensive Livestock, Marine Fisheries, as well as for a set of biosecurity risks related to these primary industry sectors. The Summary Report gives details of the chosen commodities and biosecurity risks and summarises the high-level results.\nResults Reports for each commodity and biosecurity risk are being released. Visit the project's web pages to access these reports and for further information.\nThis dataset contains maps of modelled climate suitability for the blueberry model in the Horticulture and Viticulture node of the DPIRD Climate Vulnerability Assessment. Maps are provided (in GeoTIFF format) for each element of the model: the overall climate suitability, climate suitability maps for each phenophase and also for each phenophase/climate variable combination in the model. Data is provided for each of the eight global climate models (GCMs) used in the project, as well as the climate suitability derived from historical observations, along with the ensemble median for each map.",

    "title": "Historical Australian Government Contract Notice Data",
    "description": "This is the historical contract notice (CN) data reported by Australian Government\r\nagencies for the years 1999 to 2020. The CN data has been sourced from\r\nthe Gazette Publishing System (GaPS) for the years 1999 to 2006-07, inclusive,\r\nand from the AusTender from 1 July 2007 onwards.\r\n\r\nEffective 1 July 2007, mandatory contract reporting was transferred to\r\nAusTender [www.tenders.gov.au](http://www.tenders.gov.au/) . Notices of\r\ncontracts that were active at 1 July 2007 were migrated to AusTender and will\r\ntherefore appear in both databases. These records are identifiable on\r\nAusTender by the GaPS ID reference. The reporting requirements for GaPS differed from those for AusTender reporting in terms of value thresholds, industry sector codes and contract confidentiality. For further information please contact the AusTender Help Desk at [tenders@finance.gov.au](mailto:tenders@finance.gov.au).\r\n\r\nThe CN data reflects contractual information reported by entities in accordance with entities' procurement publishing obligations. Please note that the data contained within each file was correct at the time of extraction. Data may change over time as agencies undertake data quality assurance processes or as contract information is varied. The contract values on AusTender represent the total maximum value of each contract over its life, including where contracts span multiple years. AusTender data does not reflect annual expenditure. \r\nThere is a Data Dictionary available for AusTender Contract Notice information which provides a full list of all the Contract Notice dataset field names and explains the data type, whether it is mandatory, and contains a description to provide further context for the data.\r\n\r\nNew contracts and contract amendments published within the last eighteen (18) months can be found by perusing the weekly [AusTender Contract Notice Export\r\nfiles](http://data.gov.au/dataset/austender-contract-notice-export/).\r\n\r\nContracts reported on AusTender are categorised under the United Nations Standard Products and Services Code (UNSPSC) which is reviewed and updated periodically. The UNSPSC is selected by an entity when reporting a contract to reflect the primary purpose of the contract. Below is a list of goods and services category codes used by Australian Government agencies to code their open approaches to market and contracts awarded for publication on AusTender. Code numbers starting with the prefixes **43 a Information Technology, Broadcasting and Telecommunications** and **81 a Engineering and Research and Technology Based Services** apply in the main to Information and Communications Technology related contracts, primarily ICT goods and services respectively.\r\n\r\nAusTender Contract Notice data is also available as an Application Programming Interface (API) which provides CN data in the [Open Contracting Data Standard](http://standard.open-contracting.org/) (OCDS) schema.\r\n\r\n",

    "description": "This data set in excel sheet format presents results of the mail survey of 1565 residents of the GBRWHA. The dataset is accompanied by a set of 58 maps that illustrate key findings. \n\nProject 10.2 explored how visitors and residents feel towards and perceive Great Barrier Reef World Heritage Area, as well as their willingness to pay to protect the reef and their satisfaction with current and future developments in and around the GBRWHA.   \n\nData were collected from the residents of the GBRWHA using a mail-out survey to a geographically stratified random sample of resident households in postcodes that lay partially or entirely within the study area. The pilot stage included 230 randomly selected households (2 from each of the postcodes identified), while the main mailing included about 40 households in each postcode. Following the Dilman (2007) methodology, we sent a reminder letter with replacement questionnaire to those who had not responded four weeks later, with a third reminder after that. We estimate that just under 4,000 questionnaires reached their intended recipients, and we received 902 completed questionnaires.\n\nWe were cognizant that some demographic groups are more likely to respond to mail-out surveys than others in these regions (e.g. young males, Indigenous people).  Therefore we conducted supplementary face-to-face data-collection using the same questionnaire, across various public locations such as ferry terminals, airports and beaches. These extra activities generated an additional 663 responses, bringing the total number of completed resident questionnaires to 1565.\n\n\nData Format:\n\nExcel data sheet with each row representing a postcode within the Great Barrier Reef Catchment Area and each column providing summary information about one variable (e.g. % or respondents who have never been to the GBRWHA).  The GIS maps represent the data visually (one variable per map, showing responses for each postcode).\n\nThe original raw data cannot be published for privacy reasons. Data available here is a public form of the data, aggregated by postcode.\n\nFurther details of the project, including data collection and analysis methods, can be found in:\n\nStoeckl, N., Farr, M. and Sakata H.

The environmental sensors, measuring light levels, humidity and temperature, have been deployed at Fitzroy Gardens and Library at the Dock. The data collected will assist the Urban Landscapes branch to better understand and communicate the impact of canopy cover for urban cooling.",

    "description": "Three removal experiments were conducted to test the effects of the introduced species, Bugula neritina, Ascidiella aspersa and Botryllus schlosseri on sessile invertebrate assemblages. Each experiment was run for approximately 2 months between 28th November 2004 and 13th February 2004. These experiments involved removing the introduced species from plates and then comparing these assemblages to those on disturbed control and control plates, where the introduced species had not been removed. The introduced species were removed by scraping them and surrounding species from the surface in 1/8 or 1/4 cm2 areas or by peeling individuals off with forceps. All individuals on the plates were counted and identified at the completion of the experiments.",

The Buildings dataset has relationships with the G-NAF, Cadastre, Property and Administrative Boundaries products produced by Geoscape Australia. Users should note that these related Geoscape products are not part of Buildings.\nFor more information regarding Geoscape Buildings, please refer to the Data Product Description and the June 2022 Release Notes.\nPlease note: As per the licence for this data, the coverage area accessed by you can not be greater than a single Level 2 Statistical Area (SA2) as defined by the Australian Bureau of Statistics. If you require additional data beyond a single SA2 for your research, please request a quote from AURIN.\nBuildings is a digital dataset representing buildings across Australia. Data quality and potential capture timelines will vary across Australia based on two categories, each category has been developed based on a number of factors including the probability of the occurrence of natural events (e.g. flooding), population distribution and industrial/commercial activities. Areas with a population greater than 200, or with significant industrial/commercial activity in a visual assessment have been defined as 'Urban' and all other regions have been defined as 'Rural'. This dataset has been restricted to the Melbourne SA2 by AURIN.",

    "description": "These data are derived from returns submitted to the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA) by banks authorised under the Banking Act 1959. APRA assumed responsibility for the supervision and regulation of banks on 1 July 1998. Data prior to that date were submitted to the RBA.\r\n\r\nUp to and including June 2000, data are averages of weekly (Wednesday) figures. From July 2000, data are for the last business day of every month. Up to and including March 2002, banks submitted Form D (Statement of Liabilities and Assets on the Australian Books). In March 2002, APRA implemented new reporting forms for banks. The data, dating from April 2002, are derived from ARF 320.0 Statement of Financial Position (Domestic Books).\r\n\r\nARF 320.0 covers the domestic books of the licensed bank and is an unconsolidated report of the Australian bank’s operations/transactions that are booked or recorded inside Australia (with Australian residents and non-residents). ARF 320.0 does not consolidate Australian and offshore-controlled entities (thus offshore branches of the Australian bank are excluded). ARF 320.0 includes transactions of Australian-based offshore banking units of the licensed ADI but excludes transactions of overseas-based offshore banking units.\r\n\r\nAn Australian ‘resident’ is any individual, business or other organisation domiciled in Australia. Australian branches and subsidiaries of foreign businesses are regarded as Australian residents. A ‘non-resident’ is any individual, business or other organisation domiciled overseas. Foreign branches and subsidiaries of Australian businesses are regarded as non-residents.\r\n\r\n‘Resident assets – notes and coins, and deposits due from RBA’ includes: Australian and foreign currency notes and coins; settlement account balances with the RBA and any other central bank; and any other funds held at the RBA.\r\n\r\n‘Resident assets – bills receivables’ refers to assets arising from undertakings by customers to pay bills of exchange drawn by the banks. From April 2002, this item includes Australian dollar- and foreign currency-denominated (AUD equivalent) bill receivables. Prior to that date, foreign currency-denominated (AUD equivalent) bill receivables are included in ‘resident assets – other assets’.\r\n\r\n‘Resident assets – loans and advances – residential’ include: owner-occupied and investment housing loans. ‘Resident assets – loans and advances – personal’ include: revolving credit; credit cards; personal lease financing; and other personal term loans. ‘Resident assets – loans and advances – commercial’ include: loans to community service organisations and non-profit institutions; loans to non-financial corporations; loans to general government; and loans to financial corporations. The loans and advances data are net of specific provisions for bad and doubtful debts, but gross of general provisions for bad and doubtful debts. Loans and advances exclude: bills of exchange, commercial paper, promissory notes, certificates of deposit, and some other debt securities. From April 2002, loans and advances refer to Australian dollar- and foreign currency-denominated (AUD equivalent) loans and advances. Prior to that date, foreign currency-denominated (AUD equivalent) loans and advances are included in ‘resident assets – other assets’.\r\n\r\n‘Resident assets – other assets’ refers to all other resident assets not included in the above items. Prior to April 2002, this item includes: shares; bullion; past-due bills; accounts receivable; prepayments made; public sector securities; and all other resident assets other than accrued interest not yet receivable and intangible assets. From April 2002, this item includes: cash and liquid assets other than notes and coins and deposits due from RBA; trading and investment securities; fixed assets; intangible assets; other investments and all other assets not reported above. Note that, from April 2002, this item also includes unrealised gains on trading derivatives – prior to that date, these were excluded.\r\n\r\n‘Resident assets – total’ refers to total assets on the Australian books of banks that are due from residents, and is the sum of the above items. ‘Resident assets – of which: denominated in foreign currency’ refers to the Australian dollar equivalent of ‘resident assets – total’ on the Australian books of banks that are denominated in foreign currency.\r\n\r\n‘Non-resident assets – total’ refers to total assets on the Australian books of banks that are due from non-residents, though from April 2002, this series excludes the total amount due from banks’ overseas operations, which have been separately identified on the new reporting form. ‘Non-resident assets – of which: denominated in foreign currency’ refers to the Australian dollar equivalent of ‘non-resident assets – total’ on the Australian books of banks that are denominated in foreign currency.\r\n\r\n‘Total assets’ is the sum of ‘resident assets – total’ and ‘non-resident assets – total’. From April 2002, this item also includes the ‘amount due from overseas operations’, which is identified separately from ‘resident assets – total’ and ‘non-resident assets – total’. The ‘amount due from overseas operations’ refers to domestic book on-balance sheet assets due from overseas operations of banks which have not been included in the above items.\r\n",

Monitoring is carried out by three different boat-based sampling parties, but is co-ordinated to occur on the same day each month. \nAt each site, in-situ field measurements are taken using calibrated sensors for temperature, salinity, pH, dissolved oxygen and turbidity. Water clarity is also measured using a secchi disk. Surface and bottom water samples are collected for analysis of true color, total suspended solids(TSS), total  and dissolved nutrients, organic carbon and zinc. at most sites, depth integrated samples are also collected for chlorophyll a using a plastic tube. Bottom samples in the Middle and Outer estuary are collected using a niskin bottle. Pumps are used in the upper estuary site to fill up the bottles. All water samples are analysed at Analytical Service Tasmania, a National Association of Testing Authorities-accredited laboratory. Monitoring site depth is 2 meters",
