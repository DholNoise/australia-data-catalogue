    "description": "This dataset estimates human mobility through origin destination (OD) movement flow among the Statistical Area 2 (SA2) regions in Queensland (QLD), connected by public transport (PT) networks. The SA2 regions of Queensland connected by buses, trains, trams and ferries have been used to evaluate OD movement flows. The passenger OD movement data among different stations (or the station-based OD flow) are first estimated using a statistical estimation methodology. The stations-based OD flow data are then translated into region-based OD matrices using the state-of-art method. For more information please see the original metadata file here.\nHuman mobility data is a key ingredient in various areas and domains of research including epidemiology, policy and administration, criminology, transportation, logistics and supply chains, environmental management and, pollution and contamination. High quality human mobility data provided by telecommunication companies collected from call data records (CDRs) is available at prohibitive cost with restrictive licensing, keeping it out of reach for the majority of research community. On the other hand, there is an abundance of high-quality public data, reporting different aspects of mobility. Examples are the public transport patronage and information about the usage of the Australian road network. These datasets are collected by different organisations and government departments and are presented in various formats. For instance, data may be collected at different spatial (e.g. at state or postcode levels) and temporal scales and be presented in the form of passenger counts or aggregated movement flows. This dataset addresses the general lack of national scale comprehensive human mobility dataset in Australia by transforming available mobility data into a consistent format that is suitable for analysis in a broad range of research areas. Merging the various individual datasets into Australia's first comprehensive, national-scale human mobility data asset drastically improves the quality and coverage of existing datasets.\nThe Mobility Australia project received investment (https://doi.org/10.47486/DP702) from the Australian Research Data Commons (ARDC). The ARDC is funded by the National Collaborative Research Infrastructure Strategy (NCRIS).\nThe original data tables were structured in a matrix-like format. AURIN employed a methodology to merge diverse datasets into a comprehensive one, categorising based on transportation types (e.g., trains, buses, rails, ferries), years (e.g., 2019, 2020, 2021, etc.), and temporal scales (e.g., weekly, monthly, yearly). Subsequently, AURIN spatially enabled the original data by employing the 2021 edition of the Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS). The flow between origin and destination pairs is visually represented using line geometry.",

Higher priority was given to\nspecies which are the most threatened and are indigenous to the City of\nMelbourne. \nFrom\nthis assessment process, a priority list of 56 species has been short-listed as\nappropriate threatened species for planting.   \nFor\ninclusion in the Threatened Species Assessment Tool, all species were required\nto be listed as threatened in Victoria. \nScores\nwere calculated based on the following:\n\n Cultivation\n     Requirements Subtotal = Cultivation Protocols + Propagation Protocols\n Conservation\n     Subtotal = Germplasm Source + Conservation Status + Germplasm Origin +\n     Provenance + Additional Conservation Benefit\n Total\n     Score = Cultivation Requirements Subtotal + Conservation Subtotal +\n     Additional Local Benefits Subtotal\n Total\n     Score including Horticultural Potential = Cultivation Requirements\n     Subtotal + Conservation Subtotal + Additional Local Benefits Subtotal +\n     Horticultural Potential \nThresholds\nwere set in certain categories which resulted in the removal of species from\npriority selection. Species with cells marked with an asterisk (*) were removed\nfrom the final priority plant list. In addition, an overall Total Score\nthreshold of 20 was chosen for final species selection. \n This\ndataset is based on the “City of Melbourne Threatened Plant Living Collection\nPlan” produced by R. Larke, M. Hirst and J. Arnott of the Royal Botanic Gardens\nVictoria, and N.S.G. Williams of the University of Melbourne. For documented\nmethods please refer to the report (attached).\n\n\n\n",

    "description": "This dataset presents information and locations related to The Super Tuesday Bike Count event in Darwin for 2018. The counts are presented as individual points which relate to the location where the counts were undertaken by volunteers.\nThe Super Tuesday Bike Count collects annual figures of bicycle riders and their movements on roads and bike paths. Since 2007, Bicycle Network has conducted bicycle counts at key intersections and corridors selected by local governments. The data is available for researchers and policymakers to plan and build cycling infrastructure to promote increased cycling activity, and to gather longitudinal insights of cycling volumes and trends.\nSuper Tuesday count data is collected visually by volunteer counters at intersections along popular commuter routes, as well as subsidiary routes with lower rider volumes. The count is conducted in southern states (VIC, NSW, SA, WA) between 7:00-9:00am on the first Tuesday of March; and in northern states (QLD, NT) between 6:30-8:30am on the first Tuesday of September. Count locations are nominated by traffic engineers, transport planners, and other transport officers from participating councils. Counters record all movement directions, rider gender, and bicycle volume per fifteen-minute increments on standardised count sheets. \nFor more information please visit the Norther Territory Government Open Data Portal or view the Bicycle Network Super Tuesday Count Report.\nPlease note: \n\nWhere there was no data available (\"no data\", \"NA\", \"#N/A\" in the original data) the values have been set to NULL.\n",

    "description": "Building polygons were created in February 2013 by Geoscience Australia by manually digitising the\noutline of each building off the 2011 orthophotography.\nDigitisation was done from scratch off the 2011 orthophotography within Quantum GIS.\nUsing the ArcMap 'zonal statistics' tool the minimum, mean and maximum heights were\nfound for each building polygon from the 2011 digital elevation model and the 2011 digital\nsurface model (DSM). This information was then joined to the building polygon attribute\ntable. To find the building height from ground to roof, the difference between the Mean DSM\nand mean DEM was calculated and added as a field to the attribute table. To find the\nmaximum height of each building the difference between the Maximum DSM and Mean\nDEM was calculated. Polygon area, perimeter, and x and y coordinates of each building were\nalso attached as attributes.\nAccuracy is high as the layer was based on the 2011 orthophotography. Error may have been\nintroduced through the digitisation process. Building lean in the orthophotography may also\ncontribute to polygons which are slightly inaccurately placed.\nHeight attribute accuracy is inaccurate for building polygons which have tree cover above\nthem, as the tree elevation would influence the digital surface model. Particularly the\nMax_height field may include tree heights rather than building heights in some cases.\nAttribute accuracy could be improved by using the raw 2011 lidar data (.las files) which are\nclassified at 'buildings' to attach heights. This method was tested and was extremely time\nconsuming - only the height_max field was significantly improved.\nDisclaimer",

    "description": "Geoscience Australia undertook a marine survey of the Leveque Shelf (survey number SOL5754/GA0340), a sub-basin of the Browse Basin, in May 2013. This survey provides seabed and shallow geological information to support an assessment of the CO2 storage potential of the Browse sedimentary basin. The basin, located on the Northwest Shelf, Western Australia, was previously identified by the Carbon Storage Taskforce (2009) as potentially suitable for CO2 storage. The survey was undertaken under the Australian Government's National CO2 Infrastructure Plan (NCIP) to help identify sites suitable for the long term storage of CO2 within reasonable distances of major sources of CO2 emissions. The principal aim of the Leveque Shelf marine survey was to look for evidence of any past or current gas or fluid seepage at the seabed, and to determine whether these features are related to structures (e.g. faults) in the Leveque Shelf area that may extend to the seabed. The survey also mapped seabed habitats and biota to provide information on communities and biophysical features that may be associated with seepage. This research, combined with deeper geological studies undertaken concurrently, addresses key questions on the potential for containment of CO2 in the basin's proposed CO2 storage unit, i.e. the basal sedimentary section (Late Jurassic and Early Cretaceous), and the regional integrity of the Jamieson Formation (the seal unit overlying the main reservoir). This dataset comprises sparker sub bottom profiles processed as shallow, high resolution, multichannel seismic reflection data (SEG-Y format), navigation files (P190) and stacking velocities.\n\nYou can also purchase hard copies of Geoscience Australia data and other products at http://www.ga.gov.au/products-services/how-to-order-products/sales-centre.html",

    "description": "<ul>\n<li>\n\nBurden of disease analysis is a technique that is used as a measure of population health.  It is used to compare the impact of different diseases, conditions, injuries and risk factors on a population. This impact is a combination of the fatal (years of life lost due to premature death, YLL) and non-fatal (years lived in ill health or with disability, YLD) burden, they are then combined into a summary measure of health called Disability-Adjusted Life Years, or DALY. A DALY combines the impact of dying early and living with illness.  \n</li>\n<li>\n\nIn 2018 the disease groups with the highest age standardised Disability Adjusted Life Years (DALY) rates for the ACT were cancer (27.5 per 1,000 population), mental and substance use disorders (26.4 per 1,000 population), musculoskeletal conditions (26.4 per 1,000) and cardiovascular diseases (20.5 per 1,000 population).\n</li>\n</ul>",

This dataset contains the locations of Snow petrel nests, mapped in the Mawson region during the 2004-2005 season. Location of nests were recorded with handheld Trimble Geoexplorer GPS receivers, differentially corrected and stored as an Arcview point shapefile (ESRI software).\r\n\r\nDescriptive information relating to each bird nest was recorded and a detailed description of the data fields is provided in the description of the shapefile (word document). A text file also provides the attribute information (formatted for input into R statistical software).\r\n\r\nThis work has been completed as part of ASAC project 2704 (ASAC_2704).\r\n\r\nFields recorded.\r\n\r\nSpecies\r\n\r\nActivity\r\n\r\nType\r\n\r\nEntrances\r\n\r\nSlope\r\n\r\nRemnants\r\n\r\nLatitude\r\n\r\nLongitude\r\n\r\nDate\r\n\r\nSnow\r\n\r\nEggchick\r\n\r\nCavitysize\r\n\r\nCavitydepth\r\n\r\nDistnn\r\n\r\nSubstrate\r\n\r\nComments\r\n\r\nSitedotID\r\n\r\nAspect\r\n\r\nFirstfred",

The PAES, annual Appropriation Bills (Nos. 3 and 4) and Appropriation (Parliamentary Departments) Bill (No. 2) are tabled in Parliament usually in mid-February each year.\r\n\r\nThe annual Appropriation Bills (Nos. 3 and 4) and Appropriation (Parliamentary Departments) Bill (No. 2) require that the Portfolio Budget Statements and PAES be taken into account when interpreting the appropriated items in the Schedules. Please note that not all portfolios prepare a PAES. Only those entities that are seeking additional funding for through Appropriation Bills (Nos. 3 and 4) are required to produce a PAES. The PAES incorporate measures announced since the 2019-20 Budget, including those announced in the Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook (MYEFO).\r\n\r\nThe data for the 2019-20 PAES has been made available to assist those who wish to analyse the financial information published in the PAES.

We aim to explore the polarization and emission properties of these pulsars through the application of the rotating vector model (RVM). Polarization profiles will be obtained across a wide bandwidth spanning 704 MHz to 4032 MHz. Emission heights will be measured using both the delay-radius and geometrical\n  methods to examine their frequency dependence and test the radius-to-frequency mapping (RFM) model. Spectral analyses of different profile components will be conducted to constrain pulsar emission properties, while pulse intensity modulations will be analyzed to identify potential phase-lock phenomena. Our study will provide more information on the understanding of the properties of pulsars with IP emissions.",

On an average night in the June quarter 2016, there were just over 900 young people in detention, over half of whom were unsentenced. Numbers and rates of young people in detention dropped slightly over the four years; however, this trend varied between different states and territories. Around half of all young people in detention on an average night were Indigenous. \r\n\r\nThe data set provided on data.gov.au contains data on young people in detention from June 2008 to June 2016.

This is a collaborative partnership with CSIRO, the Terrestrial Ecosystem Research Network (TERN), all states and the Northern Territory. This data update includes maps and charts of median bare soil, green and non-green vegetation for Australia from 2000 to 2014 by month, season and year. This information enables regular monitoring of ground cover to assess environmental targets, such as those for the National Landcare Program, relating to soil erosion and land management in Australia. \r\n\r\n The updated ground cover summary statistics and supporting metadata will also be available for download from the National Computational Infrastructure web page https://remote-sensing.nci.org.au/u39/public/html/modis/fractionalcover-metrics-abares/.

Researchers at the Australian National University (ANU) developed CLAM in 2004 when contracted by the NSW State Government to provide sustainability assessments of 8 coastal lakes. Several projects have since been established directly with local government and NRM groups.\n\nTo date, 27 CLAMs have been developed in New South Wales, where they generally fit within estuary management or catchment management plans. To develop these CLAMs and build local capacity to maintain them, ANU-Enterprise Pty Ltd - the commercial company of ANU developed an Accreditation Scheme whereby local consultants are trained in the CLAM approach.",

The data covers migrating settlers arriving between 01/01/2016 and 31/12/2016. The data has been aggregated following the 2011 Local Government Areas (LGA) with available data.\nThe data in your reports are sourced from the Settlement Database (SDB). Settlement Date uses a combination of either arrival date or grant date depending on where the settler was when their current SDB visa was granted. If a settler was offshore when their current SDB visa was granted then arrival date is used. If a settler was onshore when their current SDB visa was granted then visa grant date is used. SDB data is compiled from a number of sources including Department of Home Affairs, other Commonwealth agencies and service providers.\nFor more information please visit the Australian Government Data Portal.\nPlease note: \n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data.\n\n\nWhere the recorded number of settlers is less than 5, the data has been set to null for confidentiality.\n\n\nSettlers which do not have a recorded LGA have been removed from the data.\n\n",

The aim is to develop a strategic approach to pest management that considers the complexity of ecological processes involved with establishment and spread and takes account of the values and assets in the region. The project will contribute to the management of invasive plants and animals by providing prioritisation tools that align with existing regional pest management frameworks. Outcomes include: Identifying geographic areas and natural assets particularly at risk from invasive species, networks of weed and pest animal spread throughout the Wet Tropics, emerging weed threats in the Wet Tropics as a result of climate change (using climate matching methods with CLIMEX).",

In 1909 A. Gibb Maitland described the Carboniferous and Permian succession in the area drained by the Gascoyne, Lyons, Minilya and Lyndon Rivers, but referred the whole sequence to the Carboniferous. Geologists of Oil Search Ltd., under D. Dale Condit, examined the Carnarvon Basin in 1932, 1934 and 1935. Raggatt (1936) described the stratigraphy of the Permian in some detail and subdivided the Cretaceous sequence. Raggatt and Fletcher (1937) examined the fauna of the Permian of the Carnarvon Basin. Teichert did detailed stratigraphic work in the Wandagee area from 1938 to 1940. Geologists of the Bureau of Mineral Resources mapped the Minilya Sheet from 1948 to 1951, using R.A.A.F. aerial photographs. The present sheet is entirely the result of the mapping of the Bureau geologists although much of the stratigraphic nomenclature is adapted from Raggatt's and Teichert's work.",

    "description": "The digital '1:500 000 State interpreted bedrock geology of Western Australia' is an update to the '1:500 000 State interpreted bedrock geology of Western Australia, 2016'. It comprises three layers: the primary 1:500 000 State interpreted bedrock geology, the 1:500 000 State Cenozoic geology and the 1:500 000 State linear structures layer. The 1:500 000 State interpreted bedrock geology layer includes revised stratigraphy in the West Musgrave Province, West Arunta Orogen, East Pilbara, Capricorn Orogen, Eastern Capricorn basins and Murchison project areas; a new stratigraphic framework for the East Yilgarn project area is also included. The 1:500 000 State Cenozoic geology layer has no current updates from the 2016 revision. Compilation is based on published 1:100 000 and 1:250 000 Geological Series maps of Western Australia, together with GSWA and GA (AGSO, BMR) regional geological maps at scales from 1:250 000 to 1:1 000 000. Information from these maps has been modified locally, using geophysical datasets (magnetics, radiometrics and gravity), remote sensing imagery (ASTER and LANDSAT), seismic and magnetotelluric profiles, drilling, and unpublished geological mapping. The Cenozoic layer overlies the pre-Cenozoic layer to depict Cenozoic paleovalleys and other areas of significant Cenozoic bedrock. The linear structures layer refers primarily to pre-Cenozoic structures and attribution of concealed structures refers to those that are older than the pre-Cenozoic unit in question.",

    "description": "Tricyclic and tetracyclic terpane ratios are used as biomarker proxies for depositional environments and to classify crude oils and source rocks. However, the biological precursors and diagenetic drivers of these proxies are not well understood. This study reports on the discovery of tricyclic and tetracyclic breakdown products of pentacyclic hopanoids that co-elute with 14α-C19 and βα-C20–C22 cheilanthanes and C24 tetracyclic terpane in gas chromatograms. This includes hopanoid breakdown products (HBPs) that are identical to 14α-C19 cheilanthane and C24 tetracyclic terpane, biomarkers that are commonly used as indicators of terrigenous organic matter in source rocks and their derived hydrocarbon products. These HBPs were generated by pyrolysis of C30 diplopterol, a common compound found in the cell membranes of almost all hopanoid-producing bacteria, some lichens and higher plants. HBPs are common in rock-extracted bitumens and crude oils from the Neoproterozoic to the Cenozoic and across a wide range of thermal maturities. Comparison of the relative abundance of HBPs and cheilanthanes against commonly used tricyclic and tetracyclic terpane parameters shows that HBPs can drive or strongly influence terpane-based paleoenvironmental proxies. This study begins to rationalise why some of these parameters indicate specific depositional environments and proposes new ratios that quantify the impact of HBPs on biomarker proxies.\n\n<b>Citation:</b> Liyanage, T., van Maldegem, L.M., Hope, J., Schaeffer, P., Adam, P., Nytoft, H.P., Edwards, D. &amp; Brocks, J., 2025.

The location of the client is based on their place of usual residence. The data spans the financial year of 2014-2015 and is aggregated to 2015 Department of Health Primary Health Network (PHN) areas, based on the 2011 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nThe data is sourced from the Department of Health - Medicare Benefits Schedule data, which is a listing of Medicare services that are subsidised by the Australian Government. It is part of the Medicare program, managed by the Department of Health and administered by the Department of Human Services. Through the Medicare program, all Australian residents and certain categories of visitors to Australia are entitled to benefits for medical and hospital services. These benefits are based on fees determined for each service provided. These services are itemised, forming the schedule of fees. Statistics on each item are collected when benefits are claimed.\nFor further information about this dataset, visit the data source: Australian Institute of Health and Welfare - Indigenous Eye Health Measures 2017 Data Tables.\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data using the Department of Health - PHN Areas.\n\n\nThe data are crude rates.\n\n",

    "description": "This dataset is one of seven point-level samples (covering NSW, ACT, VIC, TAS, WA, NT, and SA) from the Ambient National Transport Noise data for 2018/2019. Instructions for applying for a quote to obtain the full dataset are provided below.\nAmbient has developed a comprehensive national transport noise map, offering valuable insights for home buyers, investors, researchers, urban planners, policymakers, and professionals working in community well-being and transportation. This dataset provides a powerful tool for understanding and analyzing the impacts of noise on urban environments, supporting informed decision-making in various fields.\nThe full dataset offers two main components, providing comprehensive noise levels with breakdowns by time of day (day, evening, night) and exposure levels (maximum and minimum):\nVector Data (Transport Noise Dataset Buildings):\nBuilding-level day and night noise data based on Geoscape Building Footprint (as points) data for individual noise sources: road, rail, and aircraft. The attribute data for each building captured the highest (most exposed) and lowest (least exposed) noise level across all facades of all storeys. The dataset attempted to model all roads and rail lines, based on the data available. For airlines, modelling was based on actual aircraft movements captured over two periods of around two weeks. If aircraft did not flight a specific route at that time, that route will not appear in the noise levels.\nRaster Data (Transport Noise Overlay):\nRaster representations of noise data provide a broad overview of noise distribution across areas. These include separate representations for road, rail, and aircraft noise, during both day and night, with raster resolutions ranging from 10x10m to 50x50m.\nA detailed explanation of the attributes and their values can be found below. More information about the data product can be found at https://www.ambientmaps.com.au/.\nThis sample dataset covers a single Level 2 Statistical Area (SA2) area for the vector data, Civic in ACT with SA2 code 801051053, as defined by the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS). It serves as a representative example of the full dataset's capabilities. The complete coverage for the full dataset encompasses all of the five states.\nResearchers and professionals interested in accessing the full data beyond this sample SA2 are encouraged to request a quote from AURIN: https://aurin.org.au/resources/data/ambient-maps-data/ for the full dataset. The complete offering provides a more extensive and detailed analysis, enabling in-depth studies and comprehensive urban planning initiatives.\nBy exploring this sample dataset, users can gain insights into the potential applications and value of the full Ambient Maps Noise Mapping Dataset, supporting their decision-making process for acquiring the complete data offering.\nSample data attribute explanation:\nSP = SoundPLAN – denoting these decibel (dB) values are straight out of SoundPLAN, uncorrected in any way.\nRD = Road noise\nRL = Rail noise from all rail sources. There is also HR and TR which separates Heavy Rail and Trams.\nD, E, N is day (7am to 7pm), evening (7pm to 11pm), and night (11pm to 7am) time periods.\nAircraft_DE and Aircraft_N should have an SP at the start, and present all aircraft movement noise levels for the day+evening (DE) and night (N) time periods.\nMax is the noise level at the most exposed façade\nMin is the noise level at the least exposed façade.\nBUILDING_PID refers to the GeoScape Building ID (2018/2019), which was utilized to create the initial building footprint noise data.\nFor example, SP_Rd_MAX_E = nosie levels straight out of SoundPLAN for roads, at the most exposed façade, for the evening time period.",

BERI measures the capacity of natural ecosystems to retain species diversity in the face of climate change, as a function of ecosystem area, connectivity and integrity. The indicator assesses the extent to which any given spatial configuration of natural habitat across a landscape will promote or hinder climate-induced shifts in biological distributions. It does this by analyzing the functional connectivity of each grid-cell of natural habitat to areas of habitat in the surrounding landscape which are projected to support a similar assemblage of species under climate change to that currently associated with the cell of interest. The indicator can then be aggregated and reported by any desired spatial unit – e.g. an ecosystem type, a country, or the entire planet.  \n\nThe BERI can be used to monitor and report past-to-present trends in the capacity of ecosystems to retain species diversity in the face of ongoing climate change by repeatedly recalculating the indicator using best-available mapping of ecosystem condition or integrity observed at multiple points in time, e.g. for different years. It can also serve as a leading indicator for assessing the contribution that proposed or implemented area-based actions are expected to make to enhancing the present capacity of ecosystems to retain species diversity, thereby providing a foundation for strategic prioritisation of such actions by countries.  \n\nAggregation of the raw data for reporting by a region (country, ecoregion etc.) should follow the procedure in the folder \" Calculating weighted geometric means of CSIRO BILBI indicators for a region.\" An example R script provided in the same folder can be used to perform these calculations.

The data is based on the recipient's geocoded address aggregated by Local Government Area (LGA) from the Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS) 2014.\nThe Department of Social Services (DSS) is the Australian Government's lead agency in the development and delivery of social policy, and is working to improve the lifetime wellbeing of people and families in Australia. DSS' policies and services respond to need across people's lives - looking after families, children and older people; providing a safety net for people who cannot fully support themselves; enhancing the wellbeing of people with high needs; assisting people who need help with care; and supporting a diverse and harmonious society. DSS supports people and families in Australia by encouraging independence and participation, and supporting a cohesive society.\nFor more information on this dataset please visit the Australian Government Open Data.\nFor further details on payments, see 'A guide to Australian Government payments'.\nPlease note:\n\n\nIn order to protect individuals' privacy, identified populations between 1 and 4 have been suppressed and replaced with '&lt;5' for confidentiality purposes. Additional data may be suppressed and replaced with 'n.p.' (not provided) to prevent the derivation of identified populations that have values of less than 5.\n\n\nIndividuals who live overseas, individuals who are without a valid home address and individuals who only have a postal address cannot be assigned to a locational boundary. State/territory totals derived from Local Government Area data will not match actual state and territory totals, due to different statistical geography methodologies.\n\n\nCaveats specific to payments type can be found in the relevant payment description of the original data.\n\n\nAURIN has spatialised this dataset and have made the following replacements to enforce data type consistency: \n\n\n'&lt;5' has been assigned a value of '-1' within the data\n\n\nA boolean field has been created for each data field to flag left-censored data. 'True' is assigned to fields that have been censored.\n\n\n'n.p.' (not provided) has been set to Null within the data.\n\n",

    "title": "Sydney Metropolitan Western Study Area Hydrogeological Landscapes: March 2011 (First Edition)",
    "description": "The Hydrogeological Landscape (HGL) concept provides a structure for the understanding of how salinity manifests itself in the landscape and how differences in salinity are expressed across the landscape. A HGL spatially defines areas of similar salt stores and pathways for salt mobilisation. The process of HGL determination relies on the integration of a number of factors: geology, soils, slope, regolith depth, and climate; an understanding of the differences in salinity development; and the impacts (land salinity/salt load/water electrical conductivity) in landscapes. Information sources such as soils maps, site characterisation, salinity site mapping, hydrogeological conditions and surface and groundwater data are combined to develop standard templates for each HGL. The focus of this package is the Sydney Metropolitan Western Study Area. It comprises four volumes - Volume 1: project background, regional setting, methodologies, interpretations, conclusions, glossary and references; Volume 2: HGL templates, and information associated with the use of the HGL templates; Volume 3: maps and digital spatial data developed for the project, including derivative maps to assist in land management decision making; and Volume 4: background information relevant to land management for rural and urban salinity in the Sydney Metropolitan Western Study Area. This includes information on salinity management from the perspectives of land use design, scales and types of management, landscape function, management strategies, actions and outcomes, as well as land use to be avoided.\n\nSpatial resolution for this product is 1:100 000.",

    "description": "This data was collected in August 2011 by the IMOS Ship of Opportunity Underway CO2 Measurement research group on RV Southern Surveyor (IMOS platform code: VLHJ) voyage SS2011_V03.\r\n\r\nDeparted: \tHobart, TAS, Aug 01, 2011\r\nArrived:   \tHobart, TAS, Aug 10, 2011\r\n\r\nCO2 System Overview:\r\nThe fugacity of carbon dioxide (fCO2) in surface seawater was measured using a General Oceanics Inc. automated system (Model 8050; Pierrot et al 2009). Seawater is sprayed into an equilibration chamber and CO2 in the headspace gas equilibrates with the seawater. The headspace gas is pumped through a thermoelectric condenser followed by a nafion drying tube before flowing through a Licor 7000 non-dispersive infrared gas analyser used to measure the CO2 mole fraction (XCO2) of the dried air. The gas flow is stopped temporarily for the CO2 measurements, which are made at atmospheric pressure. A set of four CO2 standards that cover the range of CO2 values expected in the ocean are analysed about every four hours to calibrate the gas analyser. The standard gas concentrations are on the WMO-X2007 mole fraction scale for CO2-in-air. Atmospheric XCO2 (dry) is measured after the standards by pumping clean outside air from an intake on the forward mast of the ship. \r\n\r\nSeawater intake and ancillary data:\r\nThe seawater intake is located at about 5.5m depth in the bow of the ship. Sea surface salinity is measured using a thermosalinograph (Seabird Electronics SBE21) located next to the CO2 system. A remote temperature sensor (Seabird Electronics SBE 38) located at the intake is used to measure sea surface temperature (SST). The travel time between the intake and CO2 system is typically about 4 minutes with warming usually less than 0.6ºC. The thermosalinograph water is from the same intake, but the supply lines separate after the intake. A comparison of thermosalinograph and equilibrator temperature records shows the temperature difference in the two lines is generally less than 0.1ºC. The thermosalinograph water line travels outside the ship and is typically warmer than the equilibrator. The travel time in water line to the thermosalinograph is 2.5 minutes faster than to the equilibrator. \r\n\r\nMeteorological data, salinity, SST, and ships position and time are taken from the ships logging system. These parameters and the data quality are maintained by the Australian Marine National Facility.",

The processes undertaken to produce this derived dataset are described in the History field in this metadata statement.\n\nAsset Database v3 in Arckaringa subregions supersedes previous versions:\n\n(1) Updated the database for M2 test results provided from ARC assessment team and created the draft BA-LEB-ARC-130-WaterDependentAssetRegister-AssetList-V20150807.xlsx \n\n(2) updated the group, subgroup, class and depth for (up to) 141 NRM WAIT assets to cooperate the feedback to OWS from relevant SA NRM regional office (whose staff missed the asset workshop). The AIDs and names of those assets are listed in table LUT_changed_asset_class_20150807 in ARC_asset_database_20150807.mdb\n\n (3) As a result of (2), added three new assets separated from three exiting assets. Those assets and their parents are listed in table LUT_ADD_3_asstes_20150807 in ARC_asset_database_20150807.mdb. The M2 and M3 test results for those 3 assets are inherited from their parents in this version\n\n(4) Four assets' names from RNE data source were changed for confidential reason and they are listed in table LUT_changed_RNE_20150807 in ARC_asset_database_20150807.mdb\n\n(5) Added Appendix C in ARC_asset_database_doc_201500807.doc is about total elements/assets in current Group and subgroup\n\n(6)Added Four SQL queries (Find_All_Used_Assets, Find_All_WD_Assets, Find_Amount_Asset_in_Class  and Find_Amount_Elements_in_Class) in ARC_asset_database_20150807.mdb for total assets and total numbers\n\n(7)The databases, especially spatial   database (ARC_asset_database_20150807Only.gdb), were changed such as duplicated attribute fields in spatial data were removed and only ID field is kept. The user needs to join the Table Assetlist or Elementlist  to the relevant spatial data.\n\n\n\nThe Asset database is registered to the BA repository as an ESRI personal goedatabase (.mdb - doubling as a MS Access database) that can store, query, and manage non-spatial data while the spatial data is in a separate file geodatabase joined by AID/ElementID.\n\nUnder the BA program, a spatial assets database is developed for each defined bioregional assessment project. The spatial elements that underpin the identification of water dependent assets are identified in the first instance by regional NRM organisations (via the WAIT tool) and supplemented with additional elements from national and state/territory government datasets. All reports received associated with the WAIT process for Arckaringa are included in the zip file as part of this dataset. \n\nElements are initially included in the preliminary assets database if they are partly or wholly within the subregion's preliminary assessment extent (Materiality Test 1, M1). Elements are then grouped into assets which are evaluated by project teams to determine whether they meet the second Materiality Test (M2). Assets meeting both Materiality Tests comprise the water dependent asset list. Descriptions of the assets identified in the Arckaringa subregion are found in the \"AssetList\" table of the database. In this version of the database only M1 has been assessed. \n\nAssets are the spatial features used by project teams to model scenarios under the BA program. Detailed attribution does not exist at the asset level. Asset attribution includes only the core set of BA-derived attributes reflecting the BA classification hierarchy, as described in Appendix A of \"ARC_asset_database_doc_20150807.doc \", located in the zip file as part of this dataset. The \"Element_to_Asset\" table contains the relationships and identifies the elements that were grouped to create each asset. Detailed information describing the database structure and content can be found in the document \"ARC_asset_database_doc_20150807.doc\" located in the zip file.\n\n## **Dataset History** \n\nVersionID\tDate\tNotes\n\n1.0\t17/03/2015\tInitial database\n\n1.1\t19/03/2015\tAdd SA point Eco data ( 2 assets and 67 Elements) and fix  some AIDs  in table AssetDecisions\n\n2\t16/04/2015\tremove 6 elements ('NGIS_Bore_HydroID_30020907','NGIS_Bore_HydroID_30020908','NGIS_Bore_HydroID_30020921','Unit No 633800074_South Australian Arid Lands_56231','Unit No 633800075_South Australian Arid Lands_56239','Unit No 633900013_South Australian Arid Lands_56243')  from relevant tables  and reprocess  two assets with AIDs 17632 and 17648 without above 3 elements for each, base on SA state information after asset community workshop\n\n3\t7/08/2015\t(1) Updated the database for M2 test results provided from ARC assessment team and created the draft BA-LEB-ARC-130-WaterDependentAssetRegister-AssetList-V20150807.xlsx \n\n(2) updated the group, subgroup, class and depth for (up to) 141 NRM WAIT assets to cooperate the feedback to OWS from relevant SA NRM regional office (whose staff missed the asset workshop).

    "description": "This dataset is the June 2022 release of Geoscape Planning for a single SA2 area (Melbourne) with SA2 code (21122).\nPlanning provides detailed planning zone codes and descriptions for parcels of land across Australia. By representing the detailed planning classification for each parcel as well as links to the relevant planning scheme/instrument. Planning provides a simple lookup for the classification on sites nationally, as well as linkages to enable further understanding of a site's potential. Planning is created through combining Geoscape Australia's Cadastre product with Planning Zones defined by a State, Territory or Local Government.\nFor more information regarding Geoscape Planning, please refer to the Data Product Description and the June 2022 Release Notes.\nPlease note: As per the licence for this data, the information is limited to a single Level 2 Statistical Area (SA2) mentioned above as defined by the Australian Bureau of Statistics. If you require additional data beyond a single SA2 for your research, please request a quote from AURIN.\nPlanning zones provide a method to divide land and describe the types of development that may occur at a location, and often describe other developmental requirements such as the height, setback or form of the structures that can be built. Planning zones allow State, Territory and local Governments to facilitate urban planning and control the development of land.\nThrough representing the planning classification from a planning zone at a Cadastre cadastral parcel level, Planning provides a granular representation of the potential for development at each site, alongside URL linkages to enable further research directly from the authoritative definition.\nThis dataset has been restricted to the Melbourne SA2 by AURIN. AURIN has extracted the selected SA2 area information from this dataset through using geometries from the May 2022 Geoscape Cadastre release. The dataset, therefore, is a tabular dataset for the selected SA2 area. ",

    "description": "The attendance rate is defined as the number of actual full-time equivalent student days attended by full-time school students in Years 1–10 as a percentage of the total number of possible student-days attended.\nData Notes:\n\n\nAttendance data for NSW government schools only. The attendance rate is calculated as (1 minus absences divided by enrolled days) multiplied by 100.\n\n\nThis data includes the student attendance rate for semester 1, semester 2 and the full year.\n\n\nStudents were learning from home for extended periods during Semester 2 2021 due to COVID-19. As a result, attendance rates for Semester 2 and full year are not reliable and have not been published.\n\n\n2020 data is not provided because students were encouraged to learn from home for several weeks in Semester 1. \n\n\nFor more detail on how attendance data for 2020 and 2021 were affected by COVID-19, please refer to CESE factsheets: ‘Effects of COVID-19 on attendance during Semester 1 2020’ and ‘2021 Semester 1 student attendance'.\n\n\n\n\nAll students in Years 1 to 10 in NSW government schools are regarded as full-time.\n\n\nKindergarten, Year 11, Year 12 students have been excluded in the attendance rates. \n\n\nUngraded (support) student attendance rates are included as a separate row and excluded from Primary and Secondary totals. Ungraded students in NSW government schools are classified as either primary or secondary according to their level of education.\n\n\nDistance education and Schools for Special Purposes’ attendance data is not currently collected.\n\n\nBushfires affected many schools' attendance in Term 4 2019 and should be taken into account when comparing Semester 2 data to other years. \n\n\nPrior to 2018 absences equalled ‘all full day absences for the period in question’. \n\n\nFrom 2020, students in mainstream support classes are reported by their underlying grade of enrolment. Students in schools for specific purposes (SSPs) are included as 'ungraded'.\n\n\nIn 2021 attendance figures were calculated differently to align with the third edition of ACARA’s National Standards for Student Attendance Data and Reporting. As a result, data is not directly comparable to previous years.\n\n\nThe Department implemented an automated attendance feed (AAF) system in Semester 1 2021. The AAF has significantly improved data quality in 2021, which has affected data comparability with previous years.\n\n\n** Note** \nIn 2018, NSW government schools implemented the national standards for student attendance data reporting. This resulted in a fall in attendance rates for most schools due to the inclusion of partial absences and accounting for student mobility in the calculation. Data for 2018 is not directly comparable with earlier years.\nSource:\n\nEducation Statistics and Measurement. Centre for Education Statistics and Evaluation.\n",

    "description": "This dataset contains topographic relief data from seabed mapping surveys on the Van Diemen Rise in the eastern Joseph Bonaparte Gulf of the Timor Sea. The survey was conducted under a Memorandum of Understanding between Geoscience Australia (GA) and the Australian Institute of Marine Science (AIMS) in two consecutive years 2009 (GA survey number GA-0322 and AIMS survey number SOL4934) and 2010 (GA survey number GA-0325 and AIMS survey number SOL5117). The surveys obtained detailed geological (sedimentological, geochemical, geophysical) and biological data (macro-benthic and infaunal diversity, community structure) for the banks, channels and plains to investigate relationships between the physical environment and associated biota for biodiversity prediction. The surveys also provide Arafura-Timor Sea, and wider northern Australian marine region context for the benthic biodiversity of the Van Diemen Rise. Four study areas were investigated across the outer to inner shelf. Refer to the GA record 'Methodologies for seabed substrate characterisation using multibeam bathymetry, backscatter, and video data: A case study for the Eastern Joseph Bonaparte Gulf, Northern Australia' for further information on processing techniques applied (GeoCat: 74092; GA Record: 2013/11).\n\nYou can also purchase hard copies of Geoscience Australia data and other products at http://www.ga.gov.au/products-services/how-to-order-products/sales-centre.html",

    "description": "Land use zoning details the type of land uses available that are permitted (with or without consent) or prohibited in each zone for all areas under the Local Environment Plan (LEP). Land use zoning in an LEP are grouped into the following broad categories: BUSINESS (B), ENVIRONMENT (E), INDUSTRIAL (IN), RESIDENTIAL (R), RECREATION (RE), RURAL (RU), SPECIAL (SP) and WATERWAYS (W). The LZN dataset shows the zoning of all areas designated under the LEP. Zones define the legally permitted and prohibited uses of a piece of land, determining if a lot can be used for commercial, industrial, residential or other purposes. In other words, it defines what can and cannot be built on a piece of land. The is a revision of the original 2006 dataset, metadata date 5 July 2016.\n The original GIS data was captured by local councils, DP&amp;I and contractors and provided in accordance with the DP&amp;I's Standard Requirements for GIS LEP data and Standard Technical Requirements for LEP maps. Before the LEP is notified on the NSW Legislation website, the mapping is checked by DP&amp;I and the Parliamentary Council's Office to ensure that it is consistent with these standards. After the LEP is notified, the GIS data is quality controlled using an ISO 9001-Quality-Certified, Quality Management System and incorporated into the Statewide dataset.\n The Land Application data relates directly to and adopts the accuracy of its reference dataset, Land and Property Information DCDB. The GIS data may be subject to change as a part of quality control, or if the LEP is amended. Please confirm dates of respective features before use as this dataset has a large temporal extent.",

The data is based on the recipient's geocoded address aggregated by Statistical Area Level 2 (SA2) from the Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS) 2016.\nThe Department of Social Services (DSS) is the Australian Government's lead agency in the development and delivery of social policy, and is working to improve the lifetime wellbeing of people and families in Australia. DSS' policies and services respond to need across people's lives - looking after families, children and older people; providing a safety net for people who cannot fully support themselves; enhancing the wellbeing of people with high needs; assisting people who need help with care; and supporting a diverse and harmonious society. DSS supports people and families in Australia by encouraging independence and participation, and supporting a cohesive society.\nFor more information on this dataset please visit the Australian Government Open Data.\nFor further details on payments, see 'A guide to Australian Government payments'.\nPlease note:\n\n\nIn order to protect individuals' privacy, identified populations between 1 and 4 have been suppressed and replaced with '&lt;5' for confidentiality purposes.

    "description": "Geoscience Australia’s Exploring for the Future (EFTF) program aims to enhance decision-making on Australia's mineral, energy, and groundwater resources by providing comprehensive geoscience data. Launched in 2016 with a $225m investment, the program has spawned various national projects, including the Australia's Resources Framework (ARF). The ARF focuses on a national perspective of Australia's surface and subsurface geology, supporting economic and social benefits, including transition to net-zero emissions.\n\nOne key sub-project within EFTF is the Geochemistry for Basin Prospectivity (G4BP) module. It explores Australian basins for basin-hosted base metal systems. The current focus (2020-2024) is on the Stuart Shelf region in South Australia, in collaboration with the Geological Survey of South Australia (GSSA) and CSIRO. The efforts aim to refine our understanding of sediment-hosted copper-cobalt-silver (Cu-Co-Ag) potential in this area.\n\nThis work has two primary objectives:\n\nGeochemical fingerprinting and baseline data collection: Comprehensive data collection and reanalysis of existing samples aim to establish baseline geochemistry for stratigraphic units.\nMineral system components: Identification of potential metal sources, fluid sources, and trap rocks using a mineral systems approach.\n\nThis data release forms the second stage release of new geochemical data for the Stuart Shelf region; the first stage release was detailed in Champion et al. (2023b). There is also an earlier data release (Champion et al., 2023a) featuring reanalysis, by modern analytical methods, of legacy mineralised and/or altered Stuart Shelf and underlying basement samples held at Geoscience Australia.",

The Future Reef MAP project is funded by Rio Tinto Alcan and administered by the Great Barrier Reef Foundation, with an equal co-investment by CSIRO. The project is the first large-scale CO2 observing system established on the Great Barrier Reef using the Rio Tinto ship, RTM Wakmatha. The research is targeted at providing information on the CO2 uptake and the controls on ocean acidification change in the region. It is providing foundation data needed to assess the vulnerability of the GBR reefs to ocean acidification. This dataset contains quality controlled underway measurements of the fugacity of CO2, atmospheric pressure, and sea surface temperature and salinity. The data management and distribution of these data were supported by the CSIRO Carbon Collaboration Cluster and the Australian Coastal Ecosystem Facility.",

    "description": "This service is designed to provide access to the full State Remotely Sensed Image Library collection of aerial imagery captured under the Spatial Imagery Services Program (SISP). This service includes the latest available high resolution aerial imagery. The service is dynamic and can be used to filter and display individual aerial photo projects. The projects range from 2cm to 50cm resolution. Accuracy is dependent on the individual projects. Periodical updates will be made to the service as new projects are captured. Projects are visible at scales 1:50,000, 1:250,000 and 1:500,000. The aerial photos comprised in each of the projects are orthorectified which removes the effects of image perspective (tilt) and relief (terrain) effects for the purpose of creating a planimetrically correct image. The resultant orthorectified images have a constant scale wherein features are represented in their “true” positions. This service supports projects captured in both GDA94 and GDA2020 datums. A Seven parameter similarity transformation has been applied to new projects that have been captured in GDA2020, this is to ensure that they align and display correctly when published in the default WGS 1984 Web Mercator (Auxiliary Sphere) projection alongside GDA94 projects. If you would like to receive updates for new projects, functionality or planned downtime please subscribe here: http://ems.gs/3qln0ijbKGR.",

    "description": "This dataset is one of seven point-level samples (covering NSW, ACT, VIC, TAS, WA, NT, and SA) from the Ambient National Transport Noise data for 2018/2019. Instructions for applying for a quote to obtain the full dataset are provided below.\nAmbient has developed a comprehensive national transport noise map, offering valuable insights for home buyers, investors, researchers, urban planners, policymakers, and professionals working in community well-being and transportation. This dataset provides a powerful tool for understanding and analyzing the impacts of noise on urban environments, supporting informed decision-making in various fields.\nThe full dataset offers two main components, providing comprehensive noise levels with breakdowns by time of day (day, evening, night) and exposure levels (maximum and minimum):\nVector Data (Transport Noise Dataset Buildings):\nBuilding-level day and night noise data based on Geoscape Building Footprint (as points) data for individual noise sources: road, rail, and aircraft. The attribute data for each building captured the highest (most exposed) and lowest (least exposed) noise level across all facades of all storeys. The dataset attempted to model all roads and rail lines, based on the data available. For airlines, modelling was based on actual aircraft movements captured over two periods of around two weeks. If aircraft did not flight a specific route at that time, that route will not appear in the noise levels.\nRaster Data (Transport Noise Overlay):\nRaster representations of noise data provide a broad overview of noise distribution across areas. These include separate representations for road, rail, and aircraft noise, during both day and night, with raster resolutions ranging from 10x10m to 50x50m.\nA detailed explanation of the attributes and their values can be found below. More information about the data product can be found at https://www.ambientmaps.com.au/.\nThis sample dataset covers a single Level 2 Statistical Area (SA2) area for the vector data, Adelaide in SA with SA2 code 401011001, as defined by the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS). It serves as a representative example of the full dataset's capabilities. The complete coverage for the full dataset encompasses all of the five states.\nResearchers and professionals interested in accessing the full data beyond this sample SA2 are encouraged to request a quote from AURIN: https://aurin.org.au/resources/data/ambient-maps-data/ for the full dataset. The complete offering provides a more extensive and detailed analysis, enabling in-depth studies and comprehensive urban planning initiatives.\nBy exploring this sample dataset, users can gain insights into the potential applications and value of the full Ambient Maps Noise Mapping Dataset, supporting their decision-making process for acquiring the complete data offering.\nSample data attribute explanation:\nSP = SoundPLAN – denoting these decibel (dB) values are straight out of SoundPLAN, uncorrected in any way.\nRD = Road noise\nRL = Rail noise from all rail sources. There is also HR and TR which separates Heavy Rail and Trams.\nD, E, N is day (7am to 7pm), evening (7pm to 11pm), and night (11pm to 7am) time periods.\nAircraft_DE and Aircraft_N should have an SP at the start, and present all aircraft movement noise levels for the day+evening (DE) and night (N) time periods.\nMax is the noise level at the most exposed façade\nMin is the noise level at the least exposed façade.\nBUILDING_PID refers to the GeoScape Building ID (2018/2019), which was utilized to create the initial building footprint noise data.\nFor example, SP_Rd_MAX_E = nosie levels straight out of SoundPLAN for roads, at the most exposed façade, for the evening time period.",

    "description": "Spatial data of the boundaries of Australia's declared World Heritage properties as at 30/06/2016. \nThere are currently twenty (20) Australian properties on the World Heritage List (as of August 2011). The Great Barrier Reef, the Tasmanian Wilderness, the Wet Tropics of Queensland and Shark Bay meet all four World Heritage criteria for natural heritage, with Kakadu National Park, Uluru-Kata Tjuta National Park, Willandra Lakes Region and the Tasmanian Wilderness being listed for both natural and cultural criteria. The Australian Fossil Mammal Sites (Naracoorte/Riversleigh), Lord Howe Island Group, Gondwana Rainforests of Australia, Fraser Island, Macquarie Island, Heard and McDonald Islands, the Greater Blue Mountains Area and Purnululu National Park are listed under the World Heritage criteria for natural heritage. The Royal Exhibition Building and Carlton Gardens, Melbourne were inscribed in the World Heritage List against Cultural criterion (ii): exhibit an important interchange of human values over a span of time or within a cultural area of the world, on developments in architecture or technology, monumental arts, town planning or landscape design. The Sydney Opera House was inscribed in the World Heritage List in 2007 against Cultural criterion (i) (see whc.unesco.org.) The Australian Convict Sites were inscribed on the World Heritage List on 31 July 2010. There are 11 sites that make up the World Heritage Australian Convict Sites against Cultural criterion (iv) and (vi). The Ningaloo Coast was inscribed on the World Heritage List in June 2011 against Natural criteria (vii) and (x). \nA single Australian World Heritage Areas database has been created by combining data which was historically stored as a separate set of data for each property. The coastline of Queensland was produced under specific contract for Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority (GBRMPA) by the Australian Surveying and Land Information Group (AUSLIG) in 1984. Originally engineered by AUSLIG from datasets produced by the Division of National Mapping and RAN Hydrographic Service; Queensland coastal information produced by AUSLIG at 250k scale with 100k elements from developing technology at the time of genesis; Island information is specific to the Great Barrier Reef Region as produced from RAN Hydrographic Service data at 100k scale. Updated against satellite imagery during the RAP process (2003-2004) to 25k scale, especially in Cairns, Whitsundays and Hinchinbrook Regions. This coastline is used to represent the coastal boundary of the Great Barrier Reef WHA, and is supplied by GBRMPA Spatial Data Centre. \nFor more information use the following link: Australian Government Data Portal.",

    "description": "The 2018 APS employee census was administered to all available Australian Public Service (APS) employees. This census approach provides a comprehensive view of the APS and ensures no eligible respondents are omitted from the survey sample, removing sampling bias and reducing sample error. The census' content is designed to establish the views of APS employees on workplace issues such as leadership, learning and development, and job satisfaction. The census ran from 7 May to 8 June 2018. Overall, 103,137 APS employees responded to the employee census, a response rate of 74%.\r\n\r\nPlease be aware that the very large number of respondents to the employee census means these files are over 200 mb in size. Downloading and opening these files may take some time.\r\n\r\n_TECHNICAL NOTES_\r\n\r\nThree files are available for download.\r\n\r\n* 2018 APS employee census - Questionnaire: This contains the 2018 APS employee census questionnaire.\r\n\r\n* 2018 APS employee census - 5 point dataset.csv: This file contains individual responses to the 2018 APS employee census as clean, tabular data as required by data.gov.au.

    "description": "Remnant vegetation mapping for the Swan Coastal Plain bioregion, Metropolitan and Peel Region Scheme areas in 2015. Part of a suite of polygon datasets that best represent remnants of original pre-1750 vegetation across the mapped areas as at 2000, 2005, 2010, 2015, 2020 and 2024. The polygons represent interpreted areas of vegetation using current and historical digital aerial photography (1953-present) sourced from State Government repositories and other commercial products e.g. Digital globe, ESRI wayback imagery and Google. Simplified condition of the vegetation has been attributed to some polygons.\n\nThe mapped area covers the Metropolitan and Peel Region Schemes, the Swan Coastal Plain bioregion as defined in the Interim Biogeographic Regionalisation of Australia V 7.1 (Commonwealth of Australia, 2025) and the Swan Coastal Plain vegetation complexes (DBCA-046) (Department of Parks and Wildlife, 2016).\n\nFor further information refer to Explanatory Report titled 'Swan Coastal Plain and Perth-Peel remnant native vegetation extent mapping in 2000-2020 (5 yearly interval) and the year 2024.pdf'",

The tables present age- and sex-specific counts and rates by cause of death, along with other summary measures.\r\n\r\nGRIM books are available for all causes of death combined and 55 other cause of death groupings. They span different years for different causes of death, depending on the data available. GRIM books for some causes of death start at 1907 and they are the only national electronic tabulations of deaths data by cause registered before 1964. Data from 1964 onwards are sourced from the AIHW [National Mortality Database](https://www.aihw.gov.au/about-our-data/our-data-collections/national-mortality-database).

    "description": "Landsat satellite imagery is used to derive woody vegetation extent products that discriminate between forest, sparse woody and non-woody land cover across a time series from 1988 to 2022. A forest is defined as woody vegetation with a minimum 20 per cent canopy cover, at least 2 metres high and a minimum area of 0.2 hectares. Note that this product is not filtered to the 0.2ha criteria for forest to allow for flexibility in different use cases. Filtering to remove areas less than 0.2ha is undertaken in downstream processing for the purposes of Australia's National Inventory Reports. Sparse woody is defined as woody vegetation with a canopy cover between 5-19 per cent.\r\n\r\nThe three-class classification (forest, sparse woody and non-woody) supersedes the two-class classification (forest and non-forest) from 2016. The new classification is produced using the same approach in terms of time series processing (conditional probability networks) as the two-class method, to detect woody vegetation cover. The three-class algorithm better encompasses the different types of woody vegetation across the Australian landscape.\r\n\r\nUnlike previous versions of the National Forest and Sparse Woody Vegetation data releases where 35 tiles have been released concurrently as part of the product, only the 25 southern tiles were supplied in the initial v7.0 release in June 2023. The 10 northern tiles have been released in July 2024 as v7.1 as a supplement to the initial product release to complete the standard 35 tiles. Please see the National Forest and Sparse Woody Vegetation data metadata pdf (Version 7.1 - 2022 release) for more information.",

The data from stable isotopes of Globigerinoides ruber were analysed to allow a preliminary understanding of the hemipelagic sedimentary environment over the last glacial / interglacial cycle. The results suggest that the core reaches the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) at ~90cm depth and MIS 6 at ~340cm corresponding to heavier 18-O values and other measured parameters.",

    "description": "Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are millisecond-duration radio bursts of extragalactic origin. Since the discovery of the first FRB in the archival Parkes/Murriyang multibeam data, a broad dichotomy in population has emerged. Some FRBs have been seen to be repeating, while others are not, despite a significant amount of follow-up using different radio telescopes. The repeating FRB 20240114A was recently discovered by CHIME/FRB, which has been seen to have an exceptionally high burst activity. Such extreme burst activity has not been seen in any other source. The repeating FRBs, such as FRB 20240114A, provide an unparalleled window into their circumburst environment due to their repeating nature, which can be used to constrain possible progenitor models and test underlying emission mechanisms. The previous Parkes/Murriyang source follow-up has also revealed intriguing spectro-polarimetric properties, such as frequency-dependent evolution of burst central frequency or chromaticity, a possible activity window, significantly large circular polarisation (CP), and frequency-dependent CP. These properties hold the key towards understanding the circumburst environment of the FRBs, and test possible progenitor models. A large bandwidth instrument with reliable polarimetry has been critical in uncovering these properties. The ultra-wideband low (UWL) receiver on Parkes/Murriyang is ideally suited to explore the source's wideband spectro-temporal and polarimetric behaviour. We propose a campaign to regularly follow up FRB 20240114A to ascertain its long-term evolution of spectro-temporal properties.",

    "description": "This dataset is a component of the 'Jervis Bay Baseline Studies' project conducted by the Department of Defence, CSIRO and the Australian Defence Force Academy.\n\nThe meteorological station (35.133S, 150.762E) recorded winds and atmospheric pressure at Governor Head (Jervis Bay). The site is several hundred metres inland of 50m high cliffs and is 63m above sea-level.\n\nThis record provides wind statistics for September 1990. Five datasets are included here representing different times of the day: 0000-0545, 0600-1145, 1200-1745 and 1800-2345. Individual measurements have been converted so that trends of wind speed and direction can be seen for the time period in question. The fifth dataset incorporates all the wind data collected irrespective of time providing a monthly summary. The station initially recorded wind data at 15 minute intervals.\n\nThis is one of thirty-six child records that relate to the parent, 629051e0-2b7b-11dd-a343-00188b4c0af8. A pdf outlining the structure and hierarchy of metadata records relating to the 'Jervis Bay Baseline Studies' project is available to download through this record. Meteorological data was collected to investigate wind forced circulation in Jervis Bay, NSW.",

    "description": "The Surface Geology of Australia 1:1M scale dataset (2012 edition) is a seamless national coverage of outcrop and surficial geology, compiled for use at or around 1:1 million scale.  The data maps outcropping bedrock geology and unconsolidated or poorly consolidated regolith material covering bedrock.  Geological units are represented as polygon and line geometries, and are attributed with information regarding stratigraphic nomenclature and hierarchy, age, lithology, and primary data source.  The dataset also contains geological contacts, structural features such as faults and shears, and miscellaneous supporting lines like the boundaries of water and ice bodies.\nThe 2012 dataset has been updated from the previous 2010 data by updating geological unit data to 2012 information in the Australian Stratigraphic Units Database (http://www.ga.gov.au/products-services/data-applications/reference-databases/stratigraphic-units.html), incorporating new published mapping in the Northern Territory and Queensland, and correcting errors or inconsistent data identified in the previous edition, particularly in the Phanerozoic geology of Western Australia.  The attribute structure of the dataset has also been revised to be more compatible with the GeoSciML data standard, published by the IUGS Commission for Geoscience Information.\nThe first edition of this national dataset was first released in 2008, with map data compiled largely from simplifying and edgematching existing 1:250 000 scale geological maps.  Where these maps were not current, more recent source maps ranging in scale from 1:50 000 to 1:1 million were used.  In some areas where the only available geological maps were old and poorly located, some repositioning of mapping using recent satellite imagery or geophysics was employed.",

    "description": "This dataset presents the location of School Disciplinary Absences for Queensland state schools by year, semester and absence type. The data spans the years of 2013-2017.\nState schools are required to report School Disciplinary Absences (SDA) for the school year in their School Annual Report. There are 4 categories of SDA: short suspension (1-5 days), long suspension (6-20 days), suspensions with proposal/recommendation for exclusion and cancellations of enrolment. A student may be suspended or excluded from a state school or schools because of disobedience, misconduct or other conduct that is prejudicial to the good order and management of the school. A student may also be excluded from a state school for contravention of a Behaviour Improvement Condition. Suspension prohibits a student from attending an educational institution for a nominated period of time (from 1-5 days or 6-20 days). Decisions to suspend a student are made by individual state school principals.\nFor further information about this dataset, please visit the Queensland Department of Education - School Disciplinary Absences.\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled this data using the Queensland Department of Education - State and Non State School Listings.\n\n\nData is made available through a AURIN-QCIF-RIDL collaboration.\n\n\nGeometries modified from State and Non-State School Listings 2012-2018, as provided by QED. For facilities which closed prior to 2012, including Richlands State School [1121], Lindum State School [1682], Wynnum North State school [221], Wynnum Central State School [87] and Hemmant State School [30], data cannot be represented spatially.\n\n\nOn 5 November 2010, state school principals were given the power to exclude students from their school. They may recommend the decision to their supervisor if they believe it is inappropriate for them to make the decision.\n\n\nThe information is displayed in terms of aggregate counts of incidents. These data do not represent the outcomes of any related appeal decisions.\n\n",

    "description": "By connecting corridors of river recovery, resilience can be built into river systems to mitigate against future floods and droughts driven by anthropogenic disturbance or climate extremes. This database can be used to systematically analyse where corridors of geomorphic river recovery could be created via conservation or rehabilitation. Analysis is undertaken in ArcGIS using the recovery potential layer of the Open Access NSW River Styles database that is available from DPIE (www.dpie.nsw.gov.au).  The River Styles database was accessed in January 2021. The database and associated workflow identifies reach and loci connections based on different combinations of recovery potential classes. Reach connections are defined as an upstream to downstream section of river that is connected end-to-end, and loci connections are defined as isolated sections of river from which recovery can be seeded and extended into adjacent reaches. This map for all freshwater stream length of the NSW Central Coast catchments, shows the spatial distribution of thirteen connections based on combinations and sequences of conservation, strategic and high recovery potential targets. Other connections of interest to river practitioners can be identified and &gt;80 different user-defined scenarios run using a workflow available at protocols.io.\nAttribution to: Macquarie University, D Agnew and K Fryirs (2022) Corridors of river recovery database and workflow.

The grids show the rainfall values across Australia in the form of two-dimensional array data. The mean data are based on the standard 30-year period 1961-1990.\n\n\n\nTo view the full metadata statement, you will need to download the dataset and view in the 'Description' tab in ArcCatalog.\n\n\n\nThis dataset has been provided to the BA Programme for use within the programme only.

Information on how to request a copy of data can be found at www.bom.gov.au/climate/data.\n\n## **Dataset History** \n\nGridded data were generated using the ANU (Australian National University) 3-D Spline (surface fitting algorithm).\n\nThe resolution of the data is 0.025 degrees ( approximately 2.5km) - as part of the 3-D analysis process a 0.025 degree resolution digital elevation model (DEM) was used.\n\nApproximately 6000 stations were used in the analysis over Australia.  All input station data underwent a high degree of quality control before analysis, and conform to WMO (World Meteorological Organisation) standards for data quality.\n\n## **Dataset Citation** \n\nBureau of Meteorology (2008) BOM, Australian Average Rainfall Data from 1961 to 1990.

    "description": "    \r\n\r\nThe data shows areas of dryland salinity risk in 2050 in the Murray-Darling\r\nBasin.Areas of risk are based on groundwater levels and air photo\r\ninterpretation. The merged data, at a nominal scale of 1:250 000, show actual\r\nareas where dryland salinity or water-tables less than 2 metres have been\r\nmeasured. For the extent map, every delineated area is underpinned by either\r\nair photo data or by one or more groundwater bores. Therefore, the area at\r\nrisk is regarded as conservative due to limitations in the spatial coverage of\r\nair photo and bore data.  number of techniques to spatially extrapolate these\r\ndata to infer potential areas at risk were trialed but were considered\r\nscientifically or statistically inadequate. Estimates of impacts are based on\r\nareas at risk having groundwater levels of less than 2 m. An impact assessment\r\nbased on groundwater less than 5 m and rising was considered inappropriate.\r\nTotal areas affected with groundwater less than 5 m and rising have been\r\npresented, but only for improved consistency with other States.\r\n\r\nSee [further metadata](http://data.daff.gov.au/anrdl/metadata_files/pa_dsa__r1in\r\n__00111a03.xml) for more detail.\r\n\r\n",

Projected elector numbers are prepared by the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) according to assumptions reflecting prevailing trends agreed to by the Northern Territory Electoral Commission. This projection is indicative of future population trends and is not official ABS population statistics.\nIn the instance where an SA1 is divided between two or more LA divisions, the SA1 index will appear on multiple rows in the file. An individual row in the file will represent elector numbers for a whole or partial SA1 as it relates to any given LA division boundary.\nFor more information please visit the Northern Territory Government Open Data Portal and read the ABS Projection Assumptions Document.\nPlease note:\n\nMembers of the Legislative Assembly that reside outside their electoral division are not represented in this dataset.\n",

    "description": "This dataset is a component of the 'Jervis Bay Baseline Studies' project conducted by the Department of Defence, CSIRO and the Australian Defence Force Academy.\n\nThe meteorological station (35.133S, 150.762E) recorded winds and atmospheric pressure at Governor Head (Jervis Bay). The site is several hundred metres inland of 50m high cliffs and is 63m above sea-level.\n\nThis record provides wind statistics for June 1991. Five datasets are included here representing different times of the day: 0000-0545, 0600-1145, 1200-1745 and 1800-2345. Individual measurements have been converted so that trends of wind speed and direction can be seen for the time period in question. The fifth dataset incorporates all the wind data collected irrespective of time providing a monthly summary. The station initially recorded wind data at 15 minute intervals.\n\nThis is one of thirty-six child records that relate to the parent, 629051e0-2b7b-11dd-a343-00188b4c0af8. A pdf outlining the structure and hierarchy of all metadata records relating to the 'Jervis Bay Baseline Studies' project is available to download through this record.

The results are displayed as actual travel speeds for each of the routes individually in a separate dataset \"Travel Speed in Metropolitan Adelaide \", as well as aggregated to form a suite of travel time performance indicators. The aggregation is done by breaking each route down into a series of 'links' and weighting travel times for each link by the average number of vehicles per hour travelling on that link.

    "description": "This data set shows the average attendance rate for students in NSW government schools by Statistical Area 4 (SA4).\nData notes\n\n\n2021 data is not comparable to previous years due to the continued effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, changes to calculation rules to align with ACARA’s national standards (version 3) and changes to the way attendance data is transferred into the department’s centralised data warehouse. Please refer to 2021 Semester 1 student attendance factsheet for more information.\n\n\n2020 data is not provided because students were encouraged to learn from home for several weeks in Semester 1. Please refer to the factsheet on The effects of COVID-19 on attendance during Semester 1 2020 for more information.\n\n\nIn 2018 NSW government schools implemented the national standards for student attendance data reporting. This resulted in a fall in attendance rates for most schools due to the inclusion of part day absences and accounting for student mobility in the calculation. Data from 2018 onwards is not comparable with earlier years.\n\n\nSchools for Specific Purposes (SSPs) are only included from 2021. Prior to this SSP attendance data was not collected centrally.\n\n\nThe attendance rate is defined as the number of actual full-time equivalent student days attended by full-time students in Years 1–10 as a percentage of the total number of possible student-days attended in Semester 1. Figures are aligned with the National Report on Schooling and the My School website.\n\n\nSA4 refers to the ABS Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS) Edition 3 Statistical Area 4 (SA4) – 2021.\n\n\n‘Other Territories’ has been assigned to Norfolk Island Central School, which operated under the responsibility of NSW Department of Education between 2018-2021.\n\n\nData source\nSemester 1 Return of Absences Collection\nData quality statement\nThe Attendance Data Quality Statement addresses the quality of the Attendance dataset using the dimensions outlined in the NSW Department of Education's data quality management framework: institutional environment, relevance, timeliness, accuracy, coherence, interpretability and accessibility.

    "description": "    \n\nMean annual (00) and monthly (01a|12) transpiration (mm) from the plant canopy\nfor the period 1980-1999.Interpretation:Canopy transpiration is far more\nspatially variable than potential evaporation, reflecting the effects of water\nlimitation in most areas of the continent. Both the annual mean and seasonal\npattern broadly resemble the corresponding patterns for rainfall. Canopy\ntranspiration maps have more acontrasta (relative variation) than the total\nevaporation or rainfall maps because transpiration is a small component of\ntotal evaporation in areas of low plant cover (the remainder being soil\nevaporation).The partitioning between soil evaporation and canopy\ntranspiration in the model is determined by leaf area index.Notes: These are\nmodel-based estimates from the BiosEquil model. Results are given for the\naBASEa (pre-1788) and aAGRICa (present day) conditions. The aAGRICa case\nincludes current agricultural inputs of water from\nirrigation.EvapCanopy.00.Agric, EvapCanopy.01.Agric a| EvapCanopy.12.Agric a\nMean annual and monthly canopy transpiration (mm) in the aAGRICa (present day)\nscenarioEvapCanopy.00.Base, EvapCanopy.01.Base a| EvapCanopy.12.Base a Mean\nannual and monthly canopy transpiration (mm) in the aBASEa (pre-1788)\nscenarioData is in geographics and GDA94.\n\nSee [further metadata](http://data.daff.gov.au/anrdl/metadata_files/pa_ctab_r9cl\n__01411a06.xml) for more detail.\n\n",

    "description": "Data were collected as part of the FutureReef MAP project, a three-year project designed to monitor ocean chemistry along the entire length of the Great Barrier Reef. The Future Reef MAP project is funded by Rio Tinto Alcan and administered by the Great Barrier Reef Foundation, with an equal co-investment by CSIRO. The project is the first large-scale CO2 observing system established on the Great Barrier Reef using the Rio Tinto ship, RTM Wakmatha. The research is targeted at providing information on the CO2 uptake and the controls on ocean acidification change in the region. It is providing foundation data needed to assess the vulnerability of the GBR reefs to ocean acidification. This dataset contains quality controlled underway measurements of the fugacity of CO2, atmospheric pressure, and sea surface temperature and salinity. The data management and distribution of these data were supported by the CSIRO Carbon Collaboration Cluster and the Australian Coastal Ecosystem Facility.",

    "description": "This data was collected in February and March 2008 by the IMOS Ship of Opportunity Underway CO2 Measurement research group on RV Southern Surveyor (IMOS platform code: VLHJ) voyage SS032008.\n\nDeparted: \tPort Adelaide, South Australia, February 28, 2008\nArrived:  \tHobart, Tasmania, March 17, 2008\n\nCO2 System Overview:\nThe fugacity of carbon dioxide (fCO2) in surface seawater was measured using a General Oceanics Inc. automated system (Model 8050; Pierrot et al 2009). Seawater is sprayed into an equilibration chamber and CO2 in the headspace gas equilibrates with the seawater. The headspace gas is pumped through a thermoelectric condenser followed by a nafion drying tube before flowing through a Licor 7000 non-dispersive infrared gas analyser used to measure the CO2 mole fraction (XCO2) of the dried air. The gas flow is stopped temporarily for the CO2 measurements, which are made at atmospheric pressure. A set of four CO2 standards that cover the range of CO2 values expected in the ocean are analysed about every four hours to calibrate the gas analyser. The standard gas concentrations are on the WMO-X2007 mole fraction scale for CO2-in-air. Atmospheric XCO2 (dry) is measured after the standards by pumping clean outside air from an intake on the forward mast of the ship. \n\nSeawater intake and ancillary data:\nThe seawater intake is located at about 5.5m depth in the bow of the ship. Sea surface salinity is measured using a thermosalinograph (Seabird Electronics SBE21) located next to the CO2 system. A remote temperature sensor (Seabird Electronics SBE 38) located at the intake is used to measure sea surface temperature (SST). The travel time between the intake and CO2 system is typically about 4 minutes with warming usually less than 0.6ºC. The thermosalinograph water is from the same intake, but the supply lines separate after the intake. A comparison of thermosalinograph and equilibrator temperature records shows the temperature difference in the two lines is generally less than 0.1ºC. The thermosalinograph water line travels outside the ship and is typically warmer than the equilibrator. The travel time in water line to the thermosalinograph is 2.5 minutes faster than to the equilibrator. \n\nMeteorological data, salinity, SST, and ships position and time are taken from the ships logging system. These parameters and the data quality are maintained by the Australian Marine National Facility.",

    "description": "This dataset presents the footprint of the number of installations of solar water heater (SWH) solar panel systems.The data spans the months from January 2020 to June 2021 and includes the total over the months from 2001 to 2019. The data is aggregated to Postal Areas (POAs) from the 2016 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nEvery month the Clean Energy Regulator (CER) publishes small-scale renewable energy installation data files. These data files provide a list of small generation units (SGU) (small-scale solar panel, wind and hydro systems) and kW capacity by installed postcode, and SWH and air source heat pumps by installed postcode. The data represents all systems that have had certificates validly created against them. The data includes new installations, upgrades to existing systems and stand-alone (off-grid) systems. This data is not publicly available via the Renewable Energy Certificate (REC) Registry and does not include systems that are pending registration or have been failed by the CER.\nFor further information about this dataset, visit the data source:Clean Energy Regulator - Postcode Data for Small-scale Installations.\nPlease note:\n\n\nA 12 month creation period for registered persons to create small-scale technology certificates applies under the Renewable Energy (Electricity) Act 2000. Therefore the 2019 and 2020 figures will continue to rise due to the 12 month creation period.\n\n\nSmall-scale technology certificates are calculated based on the life of the system. This differs for solar hot water heaters and small generation units (solar panels, wind and hydro). \n\n\nThis data is current as at 30-06-2021.\n\n\nFurther information can be found at theRenewable Energy Target FAQ.\n AURIN has made the following change to the original data:\n\n\nSpatially enabled the original data by joining the data with the 2016 ASGS POAs\n\n",

The data is based on 2016 Statistical Areas Level 3 (SA3) boundaries.\nThe AEDC is a population-based measure of children's development as they enter their first year of full-time school, and takes place nationally every three years. It looks at five domains of early childhood development: physical health and wellbeing (plus three health sub-domains), social competence, emotional maturity, language and cognitive skills, and communication skills and general knowledge.\nFor more information visit the AEDC website.\nPlease note suppression of AEDC data occurs when one or more of the following have been met:\n\n\nThree or fewer children had been assessed\n\n\nFewer than fifteen children had valid AEDC scores\n\n\nLess than two teachers had completed AEDC instruments for children in that location\n\n\nAEDC instruments were completed for less than 80% of all non special needs children\nAdditional minor suppression's have occurred where necessary to preserve confidentiality of related suppressed cells.\n\n\nPlease Note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data.\n\n\nAEDC results for Daly - Tiwi - West Arnhem (SA3 code 70203) and East Arnhem (SA3 code 70204) are combined in the original data. AURIN has assigned the results for these regions to the boundary of Daly - Tiwi - West Arnhem and excluded the boundary of East Arnhem from this dataset.\n\n",

    "description": "The City of Melbourne has installed in-ground parking bay sensors in most CBD parking bays. These sensors record when a vehicle arrives and when it departs. Each record also includes the parking restriction for the bay and whether the vehicle has overstayed that restriction. This is the data for the 2017 calendar year.\n\n\n\n\n\nKnown data issues: \n\n\n\n1. There are 860 records that have the text ‘OLD’ at the end of the restriction in the field named ‘Sign’. This has been investigated and determined the text refers to one of two things, either: \n\n\n\n· At the time of the parking event the restriction that has been captured is correct but when the data was extracted from the server (April 2018) the restriction had since changed. \n\n\n\n· (Or) The particular sensor has since been replaced. \n\n\n\n2. There are a number of records that have a negative value in the duration in field ‘seconds’. This occurs due to a sensor detecting an arrival time being after the departure time. \n\n\n\n3. There are a number of records where the arrival and departure times have not been recorded. If the time has not been recorded the time is calculated from midnight of the arrival day to either midnight of the departure day or to the departure time. \n\n\n\nData that is excluded: \n\n\n\nIn the 2017 car parking event data there are 3,858 records where the parking event goes into 2018 and ends at midnight.\nDownload:\nDownload compressed CSV (1.13GB, 35.9 million rows)",

    "description": "This dataset presents the footprint of the percentage of women having their second birth vaginally whose first birth was by caesarean section, by the mother's usual residence. This has been calculated with the number of females having their second birth vaginally whose first birth was by caesarean section, divided by the number of females having their second birth whose first birth was by caesarean section and multiplied by 100. The data spans the years of 2014-2016 and is aggregated to Statistical Area Level 3 (SA3) geographic areas from the 2011 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nThe data is sourced from the National Perinatal Data Collection (NPDC), which is a national population-based cross-sectional collection of data on pregnancy and childbirth. The data are based on births reported to the perinatal data collection in each state and territory in Australia. Midwives and other birth attendants, using information obtained from mothers and from hospital or other records, complete notification forms for each birth. A standard de-identified extract is provided to the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare (AIHW) on an annual basis to form the NPDC.\nFor further information about this dataset, please visit:\n\n\nAustralian Institute of Health and Welfare - National Core Maternity Indicators Data Tables.\n\n\nMetadata Online Registry Entry.\n\n\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data.\n\n\nA birth is defined as an event in which a baby comes out of the uterus after a pregnancy of at least 20 weeks gestation or weighing 400 grams or more.\n\n\nIncluded are those females who are having a singleton for their second birth and whose first birth was by caesarean section.\n\n\nExcluded are those females whose second birth is a multiple birth, those who are not having their second birth, and those who are having their second birth and whose first birth was a vaginal birth.\n\n\nData for Victoria in 2007 to 2009 were not available.\n\n\nData for WA in 2013 is not published as complete data due to only half a year being reported.\n\n\nFrom 2014, Caesarean section at most recent previous birth indicator data item was introduced into the Perinatal NMDS. Although not an NMDS/DSS item prior to 2014, data items appear to match the data element developed by NPDDC, Caesarean section indicator (last previous birth).\n\n\nThe sum of the reported 'Grouped by' values may not equal the Australia total.\n\n",
