    "description": "PSR J1757-1854 is the most relativistic galactic double neutron star system. Its eccentricity makes it an ideal playground for gravity experiments with pulsar timing. Via observations of its profile evolution, we can constraint its rate of geodetic precession. Currently, there are four possible geometric configurations that explain the time evolution of the polarisation swing. The geodetic precession and the Lense-Thirring effect will eventually manifest themselves in the post-Keplerian parameters within the next decade, allowing for two further tests of gravity. We propose to observe it with Parkes UWL every two months to track the profile evolution in this pulsar, and to derive times of arrival for an eventual detection of the affected Post-Keplerian parameters. These observations will be added to joint GBT and (past) MeerKAT observations, and they will be part of a long-term, global observational program of this pulsar.",

    "description": "This dataset presents the footprint of the number of installations of small generation unit (SGU) hydro systems and their rated output in kilowatts (kW). The data spans the period between the years of 2001-2018 and is aggregated to Postal Areas (POAs) from the 2016 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nEvery month the Clean Energy Regulator (CER) publishes small-scale renewable energy installation data files. These data files provide a list of SGU (small-scale solar panel, wind and hydro systems) and kW capacity by installed postcode, and solar water heaters (SWH) and air source heat pumps by installed postcode. The data represents all systems that have had certificates validly created against them. The data includes new installations, upgrades to existing systems and stand-alone (off-grid) systems. This data is not publicly available via the Renewable Energy Certificate (REC) Registry and does not include systems that are pending registration or have been failed by the CER.\nFor further information about this dataset, visit the data source:Clean Energy Regulator - Postcode Data for Small-scale Installations.\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data by joining the data with the 2016 ASGS POAs\n\n\nThe data is current as at 30-06-2019.\n\n\nRenewable Energy Target (RET) legislation allows a 12 month creation period for registered persons to create their certificates.\n\n\nSmall-scale technology certificates are calculated based on the life of the system. This differs for solar hot water heaters and small generation units (solar panels, wind and hydro). Further information can be found at theRenewable Energy Target FAQ.\n\n",

Within each distance strata sampling was done at two sites separated by 0.7 to 3 km and at each site two replicate one hour samples were taken for abundance data.\n\nSampling was also done by beam trawl (3 m * 0.5 m, 1mm mesh) at all cross shelf transects. The beam trawl was towed in very shallow water (< 2 m deep) and deeper waters (3 to 5 m deep) adjacent to the mainland at the entrance of rivers and 1 km from the rivers; n= 2 ten minute tows. \n\nThe jellyfishing was conducted at night for one hour per site utilising underwater lights (1000 W bulbs) to attract jellyfish to the research vessel.  The lights were left on for longer for the purposes of collecting jellyfishes for genetics, elemental chemistry and a piggy back projects.  Fine-mesh plankton samples (100 ?m mesh) were taken at all sites to detect \nsmall jellyfishes and describe cross-shelf patterns of plankton abundance.  All of the plankton samples have been worked up.\n\nIn all sampling designs all target species were recorded and/or collected. Some collections have been used for studies on genetics and elemental fingerprints.\n\nData was coded by Year, Latidude, Location, Site, Replicate number, and then the frequency of species of interest were recorded.  These included Carukia barnesi, Carybdea sivickisi, Carybdea xaymacana, Malo kingi, Morbaka fenneri, Cyanea sp., Mastigiassp., and Aurelia sp.\n\nIn 2007-2008 we collected 96 Carukia barnesi in all three cruises.\n\nCooktown Transect- Rockey Islets, Low Wooded Is., Lizard Is., Yonge Reef.

    "description": "This dataset presents information and locations related to The Super Tuesday Bike Count event in Palmerston for 2019. The counts are presented as individual points which relate to the location where the counts were undertaken by volunteers.\nThe Super Tuesday Bike Count collects annual figures of bicycle riders and their movements on roads and bike paths. Since 2007, Bicycle Network has conducted bicycle counts at key intersections and corridors selected by local governments. The data is available for researchers and policymakers to plan and build cycling infrastructure to promote increased cycling activity, and to gather longitudinal insights of cycling volumes and trends.\nSuper Tuesday count data is collected visually by volunteer counters at intersections along popular commuter routes, as well as subsidiary routes with lower rider volumes. The count is conducted in southern states (VIC, NSW, SA, WA) between 7:00-9:00am on the first Tuesday of March; and in northern states (QLD, NT) between 6:30-8:30am on the first Tuesday of September. Count locations are nominated by traffic engineers, transport planners, and other transport officers from participating councils. Counters record all movement directions, rider gender, and bicycle volume per fifteen-minute increments on standardised count sheets. \nFor more information please visit the Norther Territory Government Open Data Portal or view the Bicycle Network Super Tuesday Count Report.\nPlease note: \n\nWhere there was no data available (\"no data\", \"NA\", \"#N/A\" in the original data) the values have been set to NULL.\n",

    "description": "The map presents the distribution of the likelihood of koala occurrence across NSW based on publicly available data held in the Atlas of NSW Wildlife (www.bionet.nsw.gov.au). The proportion (’p’ column) of koalas (‘Koala’ column) recorded relative to a suite of arboreal mammals is presented in a 10 kilometre grid across NSW. A separate 5 kilometre grid is also available for Koala Management Area (KMA) 1 – North Coast. A measure of the confidence (‘Conf’ column) in the likelihood estimate is also presented. \nIn KMA 1 Atlas of NSW Wildlife (Bionet) record data has been supplemented with data from koala spot assessment (SAT) survey along with “rapid SAT” method undertaken where major data deficiencies remained. SAT surveys observation efforts and resulting koala records were used in the same manner as arboreal mammal records. This map can be used to inform the likely occurrence of koalas and informing decisions on mitigation of activities such as native forestry.\nDistance\nKoala Likelihood Mapping 5 km - 5 km Grid Cell\nKoala Likelihood Mapping 10 km - 10 km Grid Cell",

The indicators include: Remoteness from Settlement, Remoteness from Access, Apparent Naturalness and Biophysical Naturalness, and were derived from the definition of Wilderness Quality as the extent to which a location is remote from and undisturbed by the influence of modern development.\n\nThe NWI database consists of all measurements used to derive wilderness indicator values, the wilderness indicator values themselves, and a final Wilderness Quality index.\n\nThis is an archived dataset owned by the Commonwealth Government under the NSW Regional Forest Agreements (RFA) Data Agreement of 31 March 2000.This data is available to the public from the Department and may be used by third parties for unrestricted use provided that the copyright interests of the owners are protected.\n\nAny reproduction of this dataset must carry the following statement:\nCopyright Commonwealth of Australia 1998.\nDepartmental Deed",

    "description": "Existing satellite data were analysed in order to characterise seasonal and inter-annual variation in remotely-sensed chlorophyll-a. To maximize spatial and temporal coverage we used merged data from SeaWIFS, MERIS, and MODIS produced by the ESA using the GSM algorithm (Maritorena and Siegel, 2005; Globcolour Project). We merged normalized water-leaving radiances (not individual chl-a algorithm outputs) within 4.6 km grid over a period of more than 16 years. Monthly averages of chlorophyl-a concentration (mg m-3) are presented. Attempts were made to correlate the data with Solander Underway data. These data were not validated. Encrypted ncdf4 files can be found at the Perth Pawsey Computer centre.\nThe Pilbara Marine Conservation Partnership (PMCP) was an initiative designed to enhance the net conservation benefits of the globally-significant coral reef ecosystems of the Pilbara (Western Australia) by providing an assessment of the condition and trajectory of key ecological values. These assessments were designed to inform and complement existing governance and management arrangements and the PMCP is intended to provide ongoing advice and assessment for conservation efforts in the region, providing lasting benefits.\nThe PMCP concept is based on three core ecological components, namely:\nCoral Reef Health - concentrating mainly on habitat forming primary producers.\nFish and Sharks - their community structure, interactions and impacts on lower trophic levels.\nEnvironmental Pressures - physical and anthropogenic factors that influence the condition of reefs and associated biota.",

Comparison of the 1994 and 1993 events show similarities in some areas and differences in others. Observation of more events, (say 10 or more), may be required before a clearer picture can be obtained. The recording of more extensive data such as tides, wave activity, winds and berm geometry would provide a better understanding of the processes, and this is recommended for any future openings initiated by Council.",

    "description": "Avoca Lagoon is the largest of the four coastal lagoons within Gosford. The lagoon has a cruciform shape\nwith a surface area of 97.5 hectares and average depth of 1.3 metres. The let-out-level is approximately 2\nmetres above mean sea level. The lagoon entrance is normally closed due to the action of coastal dynamic\nprocesses which result in the formation of a beach berm across the lagoon entrance, linking Avoca and\nNorth Avoca beaches.\nGosford City Council has records of openings of the Avoca Lagoon entrance commencing in 1972. These\nrecords show that the entrance has been opened 58 times over the period 1976 to 2003, primarily for flood\ncontrol purposes. The entrance has broken out naturally on four other occasions when floodwaters caused\nthe lagoon level to rise above the level of the beach berm.\nRecords of inundation of Avoca Lagoon by ocean storms are not as complete as those available for the\nopening of the entrance. Limited data are available for severe ocean storms in May 1974, June 1978 and\nAugust 1986 when waves overtopped the beach berm and entered the lagoon.\n\nThe floodplain management process seeks to promote the adoption of an integrated approach to the management of all lands within the Avoca Lagoon catchment.\nThis floodplain management study addresses the following issues:\n<ul>\n<li>existing flood behaviour;</li>\n<li>environmental and planning considerations;</li>\n<li>future development;</li>\n<li>climatic change;</li>\n<li>flood damages;</li>\n<li>floodplain management options;</li>\n<li>floodplain management impacts;</li>\n<li>floodplain management economics;</li>\n<li>preferred floodplain management strategies.</li>\n</ul>",

This project’s primary objectives were…\n\nTo assess the suitability of drone-deployed systems for illustrating and accurately quantifying the changing topography of beach dunes, and…\nTo report on the sand erosion and accretion changes for the Floreat Beach dunes over the period 2018 to 2022.\n\nCCC obtained a WA Government grant to undertake this project under the Government’s ‘CoastWest’ coastal management initiative. This report, along with the considerable survey data and imagery acquired over the period, is the final deliverable per the terms of that grant.\nThis document reports on aerial surveys of Floreat Beach undertaken by ‘drone’ (more formally, ‘RPAS – Remotely Piloted Aircraft System’) conducted by drone operators ‘RemSense’, ‘OmniDrone’ and then ‘GeoCue’, sequentially over the period 2018 to 2022.\nThis report compares the findings across the 2018 to 2022 surveys at discrete sections of Floreat Beach, to illustrate and quantify dune erosion and accretion differences for these beach sections.

    "description": "The ISC2004_SCORES dataset represents the 2004 Index of Stream Condition (ISC) overall score and subindex scores for each ISC river reach in the state of Victoria. This was the second ISC assessment providing a snapshot of river health for major rivers and streams in Victoria, using data collected over a five-year period from 1999 to 2004. The methods used in 2004 differed to the 1999 assessment. Method changes were undertaken to strike a balance between incorporating new scientific advances while maintaining compariability of results with the 1999 benchmark. The 2004 ISC provides scores for five components of stream condition: (i) hydrology (based on change in volume and seasonality of flow from natural conditions); (ii) physical form (based on bank stability, influence of artificial barriers, and abundance and origin of coarse woody debris); (iii) streamside zone (based on types of plants; spatial extent, width, and intactness of riparian vegetation); (iv) water quality (based on an assessment of phosphorus, turbidity, electrical conductivity and pH); and (v) aquatic life (based on number of families of macroinvertebrates).

    "description": "The South-East Queensland 400m mooring (IMOS platform code SEQ400) is part of the East Australian Current (EAC) array. It was initially deployed on the 24/03/2012 at (27.33 S, 153.88 E). The site depth is 404m.\n\nObservations of currents, temperature, pressure and conductivity are measured.\n\nIn conjunction with the SEQ200 mooring and the North Stradbroke Island National Reference Station (NRS NSI), this mooring forms the inshore component of the the EAC mooring array. The East Australian Current (EAC) is the major western boundary current of the south Pacific Ocean. It plays a critical role in the ocean re-distribution of global heat from the equator to the midand- high latitudes. The EAC is relatively stable north of Brisbane, but as the current moves south 2-3 large eddies are pinched off every year. These eddies frequently move onto the continental shelf and close inshore and influence the local circulation patterns. At prominent coastal features the EAC moves away from the coast, driving upwelling which draws nutrient-rich water from a depth of 200m or more. \n\nManagement of this mooring is undertaken by staff from the National Reference Station (North Stradbroke and Maria Island).",

    "description": "This study examined the impacts of 2 of the most common epibenthic suspension feeders, Sabella spallanzanii and Styela clava, in Port Phillip Bay, by transplanting individuals from the surrounding habitat into 2 x 2m experimental plots. Densities in the plots represented naturally occurring densities, ranging from 0.5 to 10 individuals per m-2 for Sabella and from 0.5 to 5 individuals per m-2 for Styela. At the completion of the 10 week experimental period the numbers of alive and dead Sabella and Styela in each plot were counted. The infauna in each plot was sampled by inserting 2 metal cylinders to a depth of 15cm into each plot. The sediment within each cylinder was vacuumed to a depth of 10cm into a 1mm mesh bag using a diver-operated, water-driven suction device. The total area in each plot that was sampled was 0.2m2 (cylinder diameter = 35.5cm). Macrofauna were counted and identified in the laboratory to the lowest possible taxon, which was mostly Family. There were significant effects on individual taxa at Sabella and Styela densities greater than 1-2 individuals per m-2, which are densities greater than those typically recorded in Port Phillip Bay. There was a significant negative relationship between Sabella density and the abundance of lumbrinerid polychaetes and gammarid amphipods, and between Styela density and the abundance of lumbrinerids, tanaids, crustaceans as a group, and the bivalve Laternula rostrata.",

We aim to explore the polarization and emission properties of these pulsars through the application of the rotating vector model (RVM). Polarization profiles will be obtained across a wide bandwidth spanning 704 MHz to 4032 MHz. Emission heights will be measured using both the delay-radius and geometrical\n  methods to examine their frequency dependence and test the radius-to-frequency mapping (RFM) model. Spectral analyses of different profile components will be conducted to constrain pulsar emission properties, while pulse intensity modulations will be analyzed to identify potential phase-lock phenomena. Our study will provide more information on the understanding of the properties of pulsars with IP emissions.",

    "description": "This dataset presents information and locations related to The Super Tuesday Bike Count event in Darwin for 2019. The counts are presented as individual points which relate to the location where the counts were undertaken by volunteers.\nThe Super Tuesday Bike Count collects annual figures of bicycle riders and their movements on roads and bike paths. Since 2007, Bicycle Network has conducted bicycle counts at key intersections and corridors selected by local governments. The data is available for researchers and policymakers to plan and build cycling infrastructure to promote increased cycling activity, and to gather longitudinal insights of cycling volumes and trends.\nSuper Tuesday count data is collected visually by volunteer counters at intersections along popular commuter routes, as well as subsidiary routes with lower rider volumes. The count is conducted in southern states (VIC, NSW, SA, WA) between 7:00-9:00am on the first Tuesday of March; and in northern states (QLD, NT) between 6:30-8:30am on the first Tuesday of September. Count locations are nominated by traffic engineers, transport planners, and other transport officers from participating councils. Counters record all movement directions, rider gender, and bicycle volume per fifteen-minute increments on standardised count sheets. \nFor more information please visit the Norther Territory Government Open Data Portal or view the Bicycle Network Super Tuesday Count Report.\nPlease note: \n\nWhere there was no data available (\"no data\", \"NA\", \"#N/A\" in the original data) the values have been set to NULL.\n",

    "title": "AIHW - Potentially Preventable Hospitalisations (PPH) - Location of Client (PHN) 2013-2017",
    "description": "This dataset presents the footprint of statistics of potentially preventable hospitalisations (PPH). PPH does not mean that a patient admitted for that condition did not need to be hospitalised at the time of admission. Rather the hospitalisation could have potentially been prevented through the provision of appropriate preventative health interventions and early disease management in primary care and community-based care settings. PPH rates are indicators of the effectiveness of non-hospital care. The data spans the financial years of 2013-2017 and is aggregated to 2017 Department of Health Primary Health Network (PHN) areas, based on the 2016 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nThe data is sourced from the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare (AIHW) - National Hospital Morbidity Database (NHMD), which is a compilation of episode-level records from admitted patient morbidity data collection systems in Australian public and private hospitals.\nFor further information about this dataset visit the data source:Australian Institute of Health and Welfare - Potentially Preventable Hospitalisations Data Tables.\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data using the Department of Health - PHN Areas.\n\n\nIn tables presenting measures by PPH condition, some hospitalisations may account for multiple PPH conditions. As a result, conditions may not sum to categories, and categories may not sum to Total PPH.\n\n\nThe counting unit for this publication were episodes of stay, measured by financial year of separation. This may be a complete hospital stay (to discharge, transfer, or death), or a part of the stay if there was a change of care type (for example from acute to rehabilitation). As a record is included for each hospitalisation, not for each patient, patients hospitalised more than once or transferred between hospitals in the financial year will have more than one record.\n\n\nEpisodes for unqualified newborn care, posthumous organ procurement or hospital boarders were excluded.\n\n\nPopulation counts are based on estimated resident populations at 30 June for each year. Australian estimated resident population data are sourced from Australian demographic statistics (ABS cat. no. 3101.0).\n\n\nThere have been changes to PHN boundaries over time. The 2016-17 data uses concordances from 2017 based on the 2016 ASGS and 2016 Census population while previous years use the concordance files from 2015.\n\n\nNational totals include data where the place of usual residence was overseas, no fixed abode, offshore and migratory, and undefined but these data are excluded from PHN and SA3 area estimates.\n\n\nAll data for an area were suppressed (marked NP) if the number of rounded PPH was less than 5. Values assigned NP in the original data have been set to null.\n\n",

    "title": "ACT Hydrogeological Wetland Vulnerability",
    "description": "\nThe focus of this dataset is the Australian Capital Territory (ACT). It contains digital spatial data developed to assist in land management decision making in the ACT. The dataset contains hazard ratings for land salinity, stream salt load and stream EC as well as overall salinity hazard for each HGL unit. Information about landscape functions and appropriate salinity management strategies are also listed. Hyperlinks to full management descriptions for each HGL unit are provided. The Hydrogeological Landscape (HGL) concept provides a structure for understanding how differences in salinity are expressed across the landscape. A HGL spatially differentiates areas with similar salt stores and pathways for salt mobilisation. The process of delineating a HGL relies on the integration of a number of causative factors: geology, soils, slope, regolith thickness, and climate; an understanding of the different modes of salinity development; and the impacts of salinity within landscapes (land salinity, salt load and salt concentration in streams due to salt contributions from base flow and runoff ). Information sources such as soil landscape maps, site characterisation, salinity occurrence maps, hydrogeological data, surface water and groundwater data are incorporated into standardised unit descriptions.\nFit for purpose: This dataset was captured at 1:25,000 scale. This dataset is fit for use as a tool for assessing land management issues at the paddock-scale in the ACT, but this does not negate the need for site assessment at a scale suitable to any potential land use or development under consideration.  The mapping was mapped in 'GDA1994 MGA Zone 55s' and transformed to GDA2020 MGA Zone 55s.\nCredits: Rob Muller (NSW OEH), Wayne Cook (NSW OEH), Allan Nicholson (NSW DPI), Alie Cowood (UC)\nDisclaimer: While all care is taken to ensure accuracy, the ACT Government does not warrant that the map is free from error.",

    "description": "Figures represent the total number of events (births, deaths and marriages) registered in Victoria for that calendar year. Events are counted in the month and year they are registered by the Registry of Births, Deaths and Marriages. This may be different to when the event occurred.\nHigher numbers in 2016 and 2017 reflect work to clear a backlog. Improved practices from 2018 reduced the time between event and registration. From 2018 onward, figures more closely reflect actual events during the period.\nProvision of statistics is a point in time measure - the status of registered events may change. As a result there may be some variation between the sum of each month when compared with the yearly total.\nBirths figures exclude stillbirths and incomplete registrations.\nMarriages rose in 2018, following legislation allowing same-sex marriage in Australia.\nWider data sets are available for purchase. We can extract data with certain criteria, such as a date range. To purchase data, learn more about how to apply for registry data.",

Variations in microfossil records over time are used as proxies for changes in the oceans.\n\nCore E53-10 was sampled in April 1993 while visiting the Antarctic Research Facility at Florida State University. Preliminary diatom analysis of prepared slides indicate that the core contains REWORKED species. The presence of Actinocyclus ingens, Hemidiscus karstenii, Stephanopyxis spp, Denticulopsis spp and other non-Holocene/late Quaternary species were encountered throughout all the samples examined in the first two meters of the core. Upon this observation, the core was abandoned for further study. Independent results of the zinc-silica ratio analysis performed on sub-samples also indicates an anomalous response, which is interpreted to be resultant of the reworked material incorporated in the core.\n\nThis region appears to be under a sedimentary reworked environment imposed by the drop off to the north of the South Tasman Rise.",

    "description": "Daily river flows (ML/day) for a subset of river gauges throughout the Murray-Darling Basin with a modelled estimate of the contribution of Commonwealth environmental water. The evaluation of flow regimes is based on comparison of streamflow recorded at these gauges for the water year with streamflow that would have occurred in the absence of the Commonwealth water program. The Commonwealth environmental water contribution is estimated using a baseline modelling approach based on either point derivation, water accounting, and water planning information provided by CEWH, WaterNSW, GMW, and MDBA.  \r\n\r\nData for 2014 – 2017 also includes an estimate of what flows would have been in the absence of river regulation (Flow Category = PRE).  The modelling for these values was discontinued during the LTIM project in 2017.\r\n\r\nThe CEWH’s Flow-MER program examines the contribution of Commonwealth environmental water to the environmental objectives of the Basin Plan 2012 (Basin Plan) and is assisting the CEWH to demonstrate environmental outcomes and adaptively manage the water holdings. Monitoring and evaluation is focused in seven Selected Areas: the Junction of the Warrego and Darling rivers, Gwydir river system, Lachlan river system, Murrumbidgee river system, Edward/Kolety-Wakool river system, Goulburn River and Lower Murray River\r\n\r\nCompiled by the Flow-MER Basin scale project.\r\n\r\n2014-2019 data based on information from the Long Term Intervention Monitoring (LTIM) project.\r\n\r\n###Acknowledgement\r\n\r\nThe Commonwealth Environmental Water Holder and Flow-MER program acknowledge the First Nations peoples as the Traditional Owners and custodians of the lands, waterways and skies of the Murray-Darling Basin. We respect their continuing connection to culture and Country, and we thank them for their knowledge and science and the values reflected in these data.\r\n\r\n###Citation\r\n\r\nCEWH (2024) Flow-MER daily flows with CEW component.

    "description": "We request time to observe 270 pulsars on a regular basis in order to achieve three main science goals. The first is to understand pulsars: how do they spin down and what disrupts this process, how and why their profiles vary with time, whether they precess or have planetary mass companions, in short all the things that make pulsar timing noisier than the perfect clock. Secondly we want to understand the interstellar medium of our Galaxy through repeated monitoring of dispersion measure, rotation measure and flux density variations in conjunction with scintillation parameters. Finally, we provide these data as a community service both to the high-energy community where we have strong collaborative links (particularly to Fermi) and to the radio pulsar astronomers generally through the CSIRO archive. The project is on-going since 2007, we are (co-)authors on 106 papers arising from the P574 data. The data have contributed to the PhD theses of students from Bordeaux, Manchester, Oxford, Stanford, and Swinburne. We are seeking long-term project status with a view to continuing the project into the SKA era.",

Local Government kerbside collection data (2014-15) collected by the Office of Local Government was used to derive MSW data.\nUrban waste volumes may vary from year to year. Future biomass data sets could consider providing a range for these biomass residue volumes, which may better reflect the uncertainties in annual volumes that may be generated. It is also important to recognise that source separated organic residues will already be subject to some type of resource recovery and reuse (e.g. manufacture of mulch and compost products, anaerobic digestion for energy production).

    "description": "This dataset presents the footprint of the percentage of adults who delayed or avoided filling a prescription due to cost in the preceding 12 months. The data spans the years of 2013-2017 and is aggregated to 2015 Department of Health Primary Health Network (PHN) areas, based on the 2011 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nThe data is sourced from the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) 2016-17 Patient Experience Survey, collected between 1 July 2016 and 30 June 2017. It also includes data from previous Patient Experience Surveys conducted in 2013-14, 2014-15 and 2015-16. The Patient Experience Survey is conducted annually by the ABS and collects information from a representative sample of the Australian population. The Patient Experience Survey is one of several components of the Multipurpose Household Survey, as a supplement to the monthly Labour Force Survey. The Patient Experience Survey collects data on persons aged 15 years and over, who are referred to as adults for this data collection.\nFor further information about this dataset, visit the data source:Australian Institute of Health and Welfare - Patient experiences in Australia Data Tables.\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data using the Department of Health - PHN Areas.\n\n\nPercentages are calculated based on counts that have been randomly adjusted by the ABS to avoid the release of confidential data.\n\n\nAs an indication of the accuracy of estimates, 95% confidence intervals were produced. These were calculated by the ABS using standard error estimates of the proportion.\n\n\nSome of the patient experience measures for 2016-17 have age-standardised rates presented. Age-standardised rates are hypothetical rates that would have been observed if the populations studied had the same age distribution as the standard population.\n\n\nCrude rates are provided for all years. They should be used for understanding the patterns of actual service use or level of experience in a particular PHN.\n\n\nThe Patient Experience Survey excludes persons aged less than 15 years, persons living in non-private dwellings and the Indigenous Community Strata (encompassing discrete Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities).\n\n\nData for Northern Territory should be interpreted with caution as the Patient Experience Survey excluded the Indigenous Community Strata, which comprises around 25% of the estimated resident population of the Northern Territory living in private dwellings.\n\n\nRows that contain a \"#\" in \"Interpret with Caution\" indicates that the estimate has a relative standard error of 25% to 50%, which indicates a high level of sampling error relative to its value and must be taken into account when comparing this estimate with other values.\n\n\nNP - Not available for publication. The estimate is considered to be unreliable. Values assigned to NP in the original data have been set to null.\n\n",

    "description": "The Intertidal Marine Vegetation Strategies (IMVS) include separate reports and data packages that cover the floodplains of NSW estuaries. The study included extensive GIS modelling, mapping, data interrogation and an examination of literature to recommend management actions and improve the overall management of saltmarsh and mangrove habitats in NSW now and into the future. The geodata packages include information on high macrophyte potential, identified hotspots, recommended management actions (under Hydrology; Sediments; Vegetation; and People and Planning approaches), current mapped intertidal macrophytes, and projected intertidal vegetation with 0.5m and 1.5 m sea level rise. Links to relevant resources are also provided.\nImportantly, a landholders’ right to carry out agricultural or developmental activities on their land is not altered by their properties being identified in any IMVS documents and any involvement in delivering recommended management actions is entirely voluntary.\n\nNote that the recommendations are based on site-specific conditions and available information at the time of writing. As both environmental and anthropogenic conditions are dynamic, appropriate management strategies may be subject to change and current site assessments are required. Initiating changes to protect or restore hydrology or sedimentation may be complex and have unanticipated environmental, social, cultural and economic outcomes. When recommended projects are planned, expert assessment and a scrutiny of proposed actions by relevant authorities is still warranted as works may result in changes to the key ecological drivers of intertidal wetlands.\n\nImplementation of recommended actions must comply with regulatory requirements. Proposal assessments must be undertaken on a case-by-case basis as the approval pathway is not the same for every relevant Local Environmental Plan or SEPP. The planning approval pathway also depends on how a proposal is classified, the specific works to be undertaken, the location and land zoning, and whether the proponent is a public authority or private entity. There may also be other regulatory approvals that apply. Given the complexities of jurisdiction and classifications of works it is important to seek and retain written planning advice (for example, from a town planner and relevant approval authorities) during the planning stage so that environmental protection actions can be demonstrated as being compliant with current legislation and policy.",

    "description": "This dataset is shows the distribution of inshore seagrass along the eastern Queensland coastline. It is a composite of 38 surveys conducted from 1984 to 2007.\r\n\r\nCoastal seagrasses in waters shallower than -15 metres were mapped by dive surveys, under water cameras and inter-tidal aerial surveys.  The data includes location information on the spatial extent of seagrass habitats mapped in 38 surveys between 1984 ¿ 2007.  The data does not include species information.  Seagrass surveys were conducted at various times and at different precisions but the composite layer is the best depiction of seagrass for the GBRWHA and Hervey Bay presently available for planning purposes.  \r\n\r\nSeagrass distribution can change seasonally and between years, and users should ensure that they make appropriate enquires to determine whether new or more appropriate information is available.\r\n\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nThis dataset is somewhat deprecated by a more recent compilation of seagrass data in 2015 that is openly available.

    "description": "The flood study was undertaken in two stages. The aims of each stage of the flood study are:\n\nStage 1 - Hydrological Analysis\n<ul>\n<li>Collate all the relevant data on Council's existing stormwater drainage system;</li>\n<li>Develop a hydrological model to investigate the drainage system performance for the\n5, 10, 20, 100, 200 year ARI storms and the PMF;</li>\n<li>Identify  the flooding  problem areas  for  existing  development  conditions  within  the\nstudy area;</li>\n<li>Identify the flooding problem areas for ultimate development conditions (represented\nby all of the study area utilising OSD).</li>\n</ul>\n\nStage 2 - Hydraulic Analysis\n<ul>\n<li>Estimate the extent  of  flooding  and flood  levels for  the  PMF,  20 and 100  year  ARI\nfloods for existing development conditions, and</li>\n<li>Estimate  the  20  and 100  year  ARI  flood  levels and  extent  of  flooding  for  ultimate\ndevelopment conditions.</li>\n</ul>\n\nStudy Scope\n\nThe scope of the Stage 1 flood study was to use a hydrological model to estimate peak pipe and\noverland flows throughout the North Parramatta Precinct. The peak overland flows were used\nin the hydraulic modelling in Stage 2 to estimate peak flood levels and flood extents.\n\nDesign Rainfall Intensities used for the estimation of peak flows were obtained from Baulkham\nHills Shire Council \"Design Guidelines for Subdivisions / Developments.\" Storm durations\nfrom 5 minutes to 4.5 hours were used to produce rainfall patterns from which the D NS\nmodel estimates peak pipe and overland flows.\n\nThe results presented in this report are the <em>worst case</em> peak flow for each set of storm durations for a particular ARI storm. Where flood levels are noted, all levels refer to Australian Height Datum (m, AHD)",

    "description": "The purpose of this investigation was to quantitatively describe the colour patterns of the fiddler crab Uca capricornis and their ability to change on a socially significant timescale. Five experiments were conducted as part of this investigation, with fieldwork completed in East Point Reserve, Darwin (NT) from Nov. to Jan. in 04/05 and 05/06. The five experiments were: \n\n1) Quantifying colour patterns on the black carapace of the fiddler crab Uca capricornis- To examine the relationship between colouration, carapace size, and sex. This information was used to construct images illustrating the probable colour patterns of various groups of crabs.\n\n2) Colour changes associated with moulting - Cages were constructed and stocked with crabs which had been measured and photographed. In total 21 individuals (11 females, 10 males) were photographed through at least one moult. \n\n3) Colour changes associated with the semilunar cycle - During one semilunar cycle, from one neap tide to the next, digital photographs were taken of 22 crabs (10 males, 12 females) active in the cages at approximately low tide. Photos were examined to observe any colour changes on a day to day basis. \n\n4) Daily colour changes - Twenty-seven crabs (13 males, 14 females) were observed on the day after spring tide over several semilunar cycles. Digital photos of the crabs were taken before, during and after low tide. These photographs were examined for any changes in colour or pattern. \n\n5) Rapid colour changes - The ability of the crab to change colour over a 20 minute period was assessed using a portable spectrophotometer.",

DNA barcoding will aid in evaluating the extent of cephalopod biodiversity including revealing cryptic species and phylogeographic structure. Confirmation of species identities is also essential as glands from multiple individuals will be required for detailed proteomic analysis of the proteins produced by the octopus posterior salivary glands.  The chemical composition of the secretions will be determined through the application of multidisciplinary techniques, including cDNA library construction, mass spectrometry, molecular modelling and bioactivity testing.   The studies will commence in 2008 and run for several years, being the major element in a PhD project run through Dr. Fry's laboratory.\n\nData_Format \nExcel file with the following columns:\nSample ID\nDiagnosis\nDescription\nOther Ref\nGland Storage\nTissue  Tissue Storage\nVoucher\nPreservation\nImages\nOrder\nFamily\nGenus\nSpecies\nLocation\nSite\nDepth (start-stop)\nLatitude\nLongitude\nDate\nTime (UT)\nCapture\nEvent\nOther Information",

The data is an extract from the DPIRD land use areas of interest database.  The land use database contains block and belt planted mallee trees.  Only belt planting areas of interest have been extracted in this dataset. \n\nBelt planting regions were determined by digitising areas identified from orthophotography. \n\nIn a small region of the state field verification work was carried out to help validate the mallee data. Field data was used to extrapolate interpretation of mallee areas beyond the field work area and to better identify belt regions of oil mallee.\n\nThe belt plantings were gridded using 14.1km by 14.1km or 200km2 sized grids representing 20,000ha.  The grids were attributed with “Total_Area” - the total area of mallee in the grid block and “Ground_Truthed” - if there was any ground truthing within the grid area.",

    "description": "This dataset presents the footprint of the number of installations of small generation unit (SGU) wind systems and their rated output in kilowatts (kW). The data spans the months of 2009 and includes the total for the year. The data is aggregated to Postal Areas (POAs) from the 2016 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nEvery month the Clean Energy Regulator (CER) publishes small-scale renewable energy installation data files. These data files provide a list of SGU (small-scale solar panel, wind and hydro systems) and kW capacity by installed postcode, and solar water heaters (SWH) and air source heat pumps by installed postcode. The data represents all systems that have had certificates validly created against them. The data includes new installations, upgrades to existing systems and stand-alone (off-grid) systems. This data is not publicly available via the Renewable Energy Certificate (REC) Registry and does not include systems that are pending registration or have been failed by the CER.\nFor further information about this dataset, visit the data source:Clean Energy Regulator - Postcode Data for Small-scale Installations.\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data by joining the data with the 2016 ASGS POAs\n\n\nMonthly installation data is provided for months where an installation was registered.\n\n\nThe data is current as at 30-09-2018.\n\n\nRenewable Energy Target (RET) legislation allows a 12 month creation period for registered persons to create their certificates.\n\n\nSmall-scale technology certificates are calculated based on the life of the system. This differs for solar hot water heaters and small generation units (solar panels, wind and hydro). Further information can be found at theRenewable Energy Target FAQ.\n\n\nCapacity data has been revised to account for past data entry errors which caused significant inconsistencies. These systems were installed between 2001 and 2003. As a result of this revision, the cumulative installed capacity from 2004 onwards has reduced by 5.517MW.\n\n",

The data is sourced from daily fishing returns recorded by the foreign fishers while at sea. Data provided is by individual fishing operation. Weights are estimates only.\r\n\r\nAppropriate use and limitations of the data  \r\n==  \r\nThe catch weight data in logbooks are estimates only which have been recorded by fishers while at sea. Fishers usually cannot accurately weigh fish at sea, so the estimated weights are mostly based on volume (for example, the size and number of boxes of fish caught). At this time, positions are also estimates as GPS navigation systems did not exist.\r\n\r\nDisclaimer  \r\n--  \r\nThe data provided by AFMA is raw (unprocessed) data and may contain errors or be incomplete. Errors are more likely in the species caught in low volumes. AFMA makes no warranty or representation that the data is accurate or complete.

    "description": "This dataset estimates human mobility through origin destination (OD) movement flow among the Statistical Area 2 (SA2) regions in Queensland (QLD), connected by public transport (PT) networks. The SA2 regions of Queensland connected by buses, trains, trams and ferries have been used to evaluate OD movement flows. The passenger OD movement data among different stations (or the station-based OD flow) are first estimated using a statistical estimation methodology. The stations-based OD flow data are then translated into region-based OD matrices using the state-of-art method. For more information please see the original metadata file here.\nHuman mobility data is a key ingredient in various areas and domains of research including epidemiology, policy and administration, criminology, transportation, logistics and supply chains, environmental management and, pollution and contamination. High quality human mobility data provided by telecommunication companies collected from call data records (CDRs) is available at prohibitive cost with restrictive licensing, keeping it out of reach for the majority of research community. On the other hand, there is an abundance of high-quality public data, reporting different aspects of mobility. Examples are the public transport patronage and information about the usage of the Australian road network. These datasets are collected by different organisations and government departments and are presented in various formats. For instance, data may be collected at different spatial (e.g. at state or postcode levels) and temporal scales and be presented in the form of passenger counts or aggregated movement flows. This dataset addresses the general lack of national scale comprehensive human mobility dataset in Australia by transforming available mobility data into a consistent format that is suitable for analysis in a broad range of research areas. Merging the various individual datasets into Australia's first comprehensive, national-scale human mobility data asset drastically improves the quality and coverage of existing datasets.\nThe Mobility Australia project received investment (https://doi.org/10.47486/DP702) from the Australian Research Data Commons (ARDC). The ARDC is funded by the National Collaborative Research Infrastructure Strategy (NCRIS).\nThe original data tables were structured in a matrix-like format. AURIN employed a methodology to merge diverse datasets into a comprehensive one, categorising based on transportation types (e.g., trains, buses, rails, ferries), years (e.g., 2019, 2020, 2021, etc.), and temporal scales (e.g., weekly, monthly, yearly). Subsequently, AURIN spatially enabled the original data by employing the 2021 edition of the Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS). The flow between origin and destination pairs is visually represented using line geometry.",

    "description": "This dataset presents the footprint of the percentage of selected women giving birth for the first time who gave birth by caesarean section. This has been calculated with the number of selected females giving birth for the first time who gave birth by caesarean section, divided by all selected females, and multiplied by 100. The data spans the years of 2014-2016 and is aggregated to Statistical Area Level 3 (SA3) geographic areas from the 2011 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nWomen included are those who gave birth for the first time and met all of the following criteria:\n\n\nAged between 20 and 34.\n\n\nGestational age at birth between 37 and 41 completed weeks.\n\n\nPregnancy has one baby only (singleton).\n\n\nThe presentation of the baby is vertex (baby's head was at the cervix).\n\n\nThe data is sourced from the National Perinatal Data Collection (NPDC), which is a national population-based cross-sectional collection of data on pregnancy and childbirth. The data are based on births reported to the perinatal data collection in each state and territory in Australia. Midwives and other birth attendants, using information obtained from mothers and from hospital or other records, complete notification forms for each birth. A standard de-identified extract is provided to the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare (AIHW) on an annual basis to form the NPDC.\nFor further information about this dataset, please visit:\n\n\nAustralian Institute of Health and Welfare - National Core Maternity Indicators Data Tables.\n\n\nMetadata Online Registry Entry.\n\n\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data.\n\n\nA birth is defined as the event in which a baby comes out of the uterus after a pregnancy of at least 20 weeks gestation or weighing 400 grams or more.\n\n\nCaesarean section is an operative procedure to remove the baby through an incision through a female's abdomen and uterus.\n\n\nGestational age is a clinical measure of the duration of the pregnancy. For the NPDC gestational age is reported as completed weeks.\n\n\nData for selected women criteria, parity, were not available from Victoria for 2009.\n\n\nData for Tasmania from 2004 to 2012 were not available. For Tasmania from 2005 to 2012, presentations via caesarean births were not reported by hospitals still using paper-based form. Where a caesarean section occurred the presentation was recorded as ‘Not stated’. Presentations via caesarean births were included in the paper-based form from 1 January 2013. The year 2004 was not included in this analysis.\n\n\nData for Statistical Local Area Level 3 (SA3) of mother's usual residence reported using a 3-year aggregate, 2014-2016.\n\n\nThe sum of the reported 'Grouped by' values may not equal the Australia total.\n\n",

Other ISC metrics were not assessed in the project and were derived from other sources.\n\nThe Physical Form and Riparian Vegetation Metric  products are a combination of mapped Vector and Raster data as well as Tabular Summary Statistics about the mapped features. In the context of the project, the term Metrics is used to refer to both the mapped features and the summary statistics. \n\nRemote sensing data used includes 15cm true colour and infra-red aerial photography and four return multi-pulse LiDAR data.  This source data was used to derive a variety of Raster data sets including Digital Terrain Models, Slope, Vegetation Height and Vegetation Cover.  The Digital Terrain and Slope rasters were used to map Physical Form metrics including Stream Bed, Top of Bank and River Centre Lines while the Vegetation Height and Cover rasters were used to map the Riparian Vegetation metrics.\nThe Project Report \"Aerial Remote Sensing for Physical Channel Form and Riparian Vegetation Mapping\" describes the remote sensing and mapping approach used to create this data set.",

    "description": "The Indicative Australian Urban Development Risk Model (2019) predicts the risk of urban expansion for the decade 2016-2026, at a 250m cell size. It is based on extrapolating identifiable trends from 2006-2016, stratified within Australia’s 109 Significant Urban Areas and eight Greater Capital City Statistical Areas (Australian Bureau of Statistics, 2016). It has been developed, as an experimental dataset, by the Environmental Resources Information Network (ERIN), in the Commonwealth Department of the Environment and Energy, with the intent of aiding assessment of threat exposure for threatened species. Four parameters logically correlated with urban development were identified, assessed and extrapolated as individual risk values. These were then combined with equal weights in an index. Index values for all grid cells were classified into five risk classes and mapped in a spatial model which also integrates Protected Areas (minimal risk) and existing urban areas, for completeness. The model is restricted to Australia’s 109 Significant Urban Areas and eight Greater Capital City Statistical Areas.\nThe indicative Australian Urban Development Risk Model is based on an assumption that recent-past trends in urban expansion (i.e the transition from non-urban land use to urban land use) will continue linearly, and that parameters associated with past expansion are valid predictors of future expansion.\nThe model is underpinned by a conceptual logic, derived within ERIN, based on known datasets and their reasonable association with patterns of urbanisation. Specifically, ERIN predicts a higher urban development risk for non-urban locations with:\n\n\nproximity to existing high urban development areas\n\n\nhigh increasing trend in street address density\n\n\nland uses evidently prone to urbanisation and\n\n\nattractive geomorphology.\n\n\nFor more detailed information please read the Department of Energy and Environments Find Environmental Data site.",

The census' content is designed to establish the views of APS employees on workplace issues such as leadership, learning and development, and job satisfaction. The census ran from 8 May to 9 June 2017. Overall, 99,417 APS employees responded to the employee census, a response rate of 71%.\r\n\r\nPlease be aware that the very large number of respondents to the employee census means these files are over 200 mb in size. Downloading and opening these files may take some time.\r\n\r\n_TECHNICAL NOTES_\r\n\r\nThree files are available for download.\r\n\r\n* 2017 APS employee census - Questionnaire: This contains the 2017 APS employee census questionnaire.\r\n\r\n* 2017 APS employee census - 5 point dataset.csv: This file contains individual responses to the 2017 APS employee census as clean, tabular data as required by data.gov.au.

From there, they are downloaded by NOAA for their In Situ Quality Monitoring web site (iQUAM2) and made available for satellite SST validation.\nThe SBE 38 SST data are used within the Australian Bureau of Meteorology for real-time satellite SST validation and ingested into real-time SST analyses which are then used as the boundary condition for Numerical Weather Prediction models.\nThe meteorological and SST data are uploaded onto the Global Telecommunications System (GTS) for global dissemination to Meteorological Agencies, and separately supplied to the SAMOS (http://samos.coaps.fsu.edu/html/) Project for air-sea flux research.\nThe real-time SBE 38 SST data are currently (2017) used in the following data products (accessed via the GTS):\n• International Comprehensive Ocean-Atmosphere Data Set (ICOADS R3.0) (http://icoads.noaa.gov/) \n• NOAA NCEI Extended Reconstructed Sea Surface Temperature version 4 (ERSST.v4) (https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/data-access/marineocean-data/extended-reconstructed-sea-surface-temperature-ersst-v4)\n• Hadley Centre SST Data Set (HadSST3) (http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/hadobs/hadsst3/)\n• Global Ocean Surface Underway Data (GOSUD) Project (http://www.gosud.org/) \n• Bureau of Meteorology daily and weekly SST analyses (http://www.bom.gov.au/marine/sst.shtml) \n• NOAA NCEI “Reynolds” daily global OISST analysis (https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/oisst)\n• NASA JPL “MUR” 1 km daily global SST analysis (https://mur.jpl.nasa.gov/)\n• UK Met Office “OSTIA” daily global SST analysis (http://ghrsst-pp.metoffice.com/pages/latest_analysis/ostia.html)\n• CMC daily global SST analysis\n• Ourocean “G1SST” global daily 1 km SST analysis (https://ourocean.jpl.nasa.gov/SST)\nAs part of the underway data gathering system, other datasets are produced (e.g., pCO2, ISAR SST) which are processed separately and have their own metadata records.\nData are recorded at 5 second intervals. Near real-time data are available via the link \"Visualisation tool for Underway Data.\" This dataset will be processed and archived within the  CSIRO Oceans &amp; Atmosphere (O&amp;A) Information and Data Centre (IDC) in Hobart (TAS). Data are available at time intervals of 5 sec (NetCDF format), 10 sec and 5 min (ASCII format). Additional information regarding this dataset is contained in the Voyage Summary and/or the Data Processing Report for this voyage.",

This flood has a 50% chance of being experienced at least once in a person's lifetime. The 1 in 100 AEP flood has been generally adopted in Australia and overseas as the basis for floodplain management planning.\n</li>\n<li>\n\nFloodplain - the portion of a river valley next to the river channel which is covered with water when the river overflows its banks during major river flows. The term also applies to land adjacent to estuaries which is subject to flooding.\n</li>\n<li>\n\nDesignated flood event (DFE) - used for planning purposes and is generally the 1 in 100 (1%) AEP \"designed\" flood event. However, a designated flood event could be based on an \"actual\" flood event (e.g. Moora 1999 flood event) or an alternative scenario (i.e. Yakamia Creek - 1 in 100 (1%) AEP flood event plus sea level rise).\n</li>\n<li>\n\nMaximum channel capacity (MCC) - the maximum flow that a waterway can contain before breaking out across the floodplain during a flood event. \n</li>\n<li>\n\nProbable maximum flood (PMF) - the largest flood that could conceivably occur at a particular location, resulting from probable maximum precipitation. The PMF defines the extent of flood-prone land. Generally, it is not physically or financially possible to provide general protection against this event.\n</li>\n<li>\n\nAustralian Height Datum (AHD) - is a geodetic datum for altitude measurement in Australia. It was adopted in 1971 by the National Mapping Council as the datum to which all vertical control for mapping is to be referred. The datum is based on the mean sea level (1966-1968) being assigned the value 0.000m on the Australian Height Datum (AHD) at 30 tide gauges around the coast of the Australian continent.\n</li>\n</ul>",

The Future Reef MAP project is funded by Rio Tinto Alcan and administered by the Great Barrier Reef Foundation, with an equal co-investment by CSIRO. The project is the first large-scale CO2 observing system established on the Great Barrier Reef using the Rio Tinto ship, RTM Wakmatha. The research is targeted at providing information on the CO2 uptake and the controls on ocean acidification change in the region. It is providing foundation data needed to assess the vulnerability of the GBR reefs to ocean acidification. This dataset contains quality controlled underway measurements of the fugacity of CO2, atmospheric pressure, and sea surface temperature and salinity. The data management and distribution of these data were supported by the CSIRO Carbon Collaboration Cluster and the Australian Coastal Ecosystem Facility.",
