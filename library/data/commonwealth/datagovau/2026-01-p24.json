    "description": "A regionalisation of Australian waters (excluding waters adjacent to the Territory of Heard Island and McDonald Islands, and waters adjacent to the Australian Antarctic Territory) derived from deep-water demersal fish assemblages. A total of 41 onshelf and offshelf provincial bioregions were identified for IMCRA v4.0.\n\nOnshelf provincial bioregions are based on the 17 IMCRA v3.3 demersal provinces and biotones identified in 1997.\n\nOffshelf provincial bioregions were defined in 2004 as part of a program run by Geoscience Australia, CSIRO Marine Research and the National Oceans Office. They represent units that contain broad patterns in biodiversity, as represented by deep-water demersal fish assemblages, based on the assumption that the demersal fish distributions are a surrogate of marine faunal distributions. Below 2,000 m water depth, the boundaries of the benthic provincial bioregions are defined solely by the NMB (National Marine Bioregionalisation) geomorphic features data set. A total of 24 offshelf benthic provincial bioregions were defined on this basis, including 15 core bioregions representing areas of endemism, and 9 transition zones representing areas of faunal mixing.\n\nFor IMCRA v4.0 the coastline was replaced with the national 100k coastline to provide greater consistency. The Australian EEZ limit was sourced from AMB v2. Based on a decision by the Bioregionalisation Working Group, the shelf break from IMCRA v3.3 was largely retained, although in some instances the shelf break from the NMB (National Marine Bioregionalisation) provincial bioregions was used.This data has been licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Australia Licence.

    "description": "The EAC3 deepwater mooring was deployed in April 2012 at (-27.26 S, 154.29 E) off the Queensland coast, near Brisbane, Australia. The mooring was recovered in August 2013 and the array decommissioned, and a newly configured array (with new moorings) was redeployed in May 2015. \n\nInstrumentation on the mooring includes Acoustic Doppler Current Profilers (ADCPs): Long Ranger, Sentinel 300 and Quartermaster, Seabird SBE37SMPs, temperature loggers (Star Oddi, Starmon Mini) and discrete current meters (Aquadopp 6000).\n\nThe mooring will collect a time series of full-depth profiles of water velocity and discrete temperature and salinity measurements. \n\nThe array will consist of 9 current meter and property moorings extending eastward from the Queensland Coastal Node shelf mooring array near Brisbane to the deep ocean. The moorings will be at 500-600 m intervals across the Continental Slope and increasing to 800-1000 m in the deep ocean.  \n\nThe East Australian Current (EAC) is the major western boundary current of the south Pacific Ocean. It plays a critical role in the ocean re-distribution of global heat from the equator to the midand- high latitudes. The EAC is relatively stable north of Brisbane, but as the current moves south 2-3 large eddies are pinched off every year. These eddies frequently move onto the continental shelf and close inshore and influence the local circulation patterns. At prominent coastal features the EAC moves away from the coast, driving upwelling which draws nutrient-rich water from a depth of 200-m or more.",

    "description": "## **Abstract** \n\nThis dataset was supplied to the Bioregional Assessment Programme by a third party and is presented here as originally supplied. Metadata was not provided and has been compiled by the Bioregional Assessment Programme based on the known details at the time of acquisition.\n\n\n\nA review of water rights in the asset register by NSW Office of Water noted that Basic Landholder Rights were omitted. This summary of Basic Landholder Rights from Water Sharing Plans was provided.\n\nBasic Landholder Rights (BLR) are a replacement for Riparian Extraction. This change maintained the right of those adjacent to rivers, estuaries, lakes or aquifers underlying the land to extract water for domestic and stock use without a licence. \n\nDefinition of \"Basic Landholder Rights\"\n\nDomestic and Stock Rights -An owner or occupier of a landholding is entitled,without the need for an access licence, water supply work approval or water use approval:\n\n- To take water from any river, estuary or lake to which the land has frontage or from any aquifer underlying the land, and\n\n- To construct and use a water supply work for that purpose, and\n\n- To use the water so taken for domest ic consumption and stock watering, but not for any other purpose.\n\nThis does not authorise a landholder to construct a dam or water bore without a water supply work approval.\n\nDomestic Consumption, in relation to land, means consumption for normal household purposes in domestic premises situated on the land.\n\nStock Watering, in relation to land, means the watering of stock being raised on the land, but does not include the use of water in connection with intensive animal husbandry.\n\n\n\nAs basic land rights are excluded from the licensing framework, they have to date not been included in the BA Assessments, including defining assets.\n\n\n\nThis dataset has been provided to the BA Programme for use within the programme only. Current water sharing plans are available from http://www.legislation.nsw.gov.au/\n\n## **Dataset History** \n\nThe dataset summarised the Basic Landhlder Rights from water sharing plans available on http://143.119.201.4/scanact/inforce/SRTITLE/W\n\nThe data was provided on 18 June 2014. The word document extracts are included in the dataset which are extracted from the legal documents, as well as the summary of basic land rights for surface water & groundwater and native title where appropriate.\n\n\n\nWhere land rights and native title was provided as ML/day, this has been converted to ML/year for consistency.\n\nThis dataset has been manually transposed and therefore if errors are identified, please contact the metadata owner\n\n## **Dataset Citation** \n\nNSW Office of Water (2014) NSW Summary Basic Landholder Rights from Water Sharing Plans v1 20140618.

The data spans the months of 2002 and includes a total for the year. The data is aggregated to Postal Areas (POAs) from the 2016 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nEvery month the Clean Energy Regulator (CER) publishes small-scale renewable energy installation data files. These data files provide a list of small generation units (SGU) (small-scale solar panel, wind and hydro systems) and kW capacity by installed postcode, and SWH and air source heat pumps by installed postcode. The data represents all systems that have had certificates validly created against them. The data includes new installations, upgrades to existing systems and stand-alone (off-grid) systems. This data is not publicly available via the Renewable Energy Certificate (REC) Registry and does not include systems that are pending registration or have been failed by the CER.\nFor further information about this dataset, visit the data source:Clean Energy Regulator - Postcode Data for Small-scale Installations.\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data by joining the data with the 2016 ASGS POAs\n\n\nThe data is current as at 30-09-2018.\n\n\nRenewable Energy Target (RET) legislation allows a 12 month creation period for registered persons to create their certificates.\n\n\nSmall-scale technology certificates are calculated based on the life of the system. This differs for solar hot water heaters and small generation units (solar panels, wind and hydro). Further information can be found at theRenewable Energy Target FAQ.\n\n",

    "description": "Overview  \r\n Overview Since 2007 ABARES has conducted an annual survey of vegetable growing farm businesses to provide industry and government with information about farm-level production and the financial situation of vegetable growers. This report contains results from the ABARES survey of vegetable growing farms conducted from March to June 2016, which collected data on the characteristics of vegetable farms in 2014-15 and 2015-16. \r\n\r\n Key Issues  \r\n• In 2015-16 average farm cash income of Australian vegetable-growing farms is estimated to have increased to around $249 000 per farm. Vegetable cash receipts increased as a result of higher vegetable production, mainly from an increase in crop yields. \r\n• The average rate of return (excluding capital appreciation) of Australian vegetable-growing farms increased to 3.0 per cent in 2014-15 and 3.6 per cent in 2015-16. \r\n• In 2014-15 an estimated 12 per cent of vegetable-growing farms made additions to total capital. These consisted primarily of land purchases but also included plant, machinery and equipment. \r\n• The majority of debt held by Australian vegetable-growing farms is for working capital management and land purchases. Nationally, farm debt fell by 7 per cent during 2014-15 to an average of $454 200 (in 2015-16 dollars). \r\n",

The Future Reef MAP project is funded by Rio Tinto Alcan and administered by the Great Barrier Reef Foundation, with an equal co-investment by CSIRO. The project is the first large-scale CO2 observing system established on the Great Barrier Reef using the Rio Tinto ship, RTM Wakmatha. The research is targeted at providing information on the CO2 uptake and the controls on ocean acidification change in the region. It is providing foundation data needed to assess the vulnerability of the GBR reefs to ocean acidification. This dataset contains quality controlled underway measurements of the fugacity of CO2, atmospheric pressure, and sea surface temperature and salinity. The data management and distribution of these data were supported by the CSIRO Carbon Collaboration Cluster and the Australian Coastal Ecosystem Facility.",

    "description": "Geoscience Australia conducts field activities to better understand groundwater systems in areas where land-connected stakeholders, including farmers and First Nations Australians, have rights and interests. Communicating effectively, in inclusive, transparent and accessible ways is essential to ensure non-technical stakeholders understand what message is being conveyed. Creating tools for geoscientists to use for land access and other outreach or consultations helps them plan community engagement and ensures that community members have a better understanding of Earth Science and therefore improved access to the information they need to be able to make informed decisions.\n\nSimplified animations, comic-style factsheets, and physical models have been created and tested to illustrate data acquisition techniques, what interpreted data looks like and how it is used. Tailored templates have been designed to ensure that the data collected is provided to impacted stakeholders at the end of field activities. In addition, portable, interactive groundwater exhibits and activities have been created and used at community outreach events. These have been found to be successful in holding the interest of the general public, substantially increasing the number of conversations about groundwater geoscience and exposing people to the data that is publicly available and possibly of interest to them.\n\nWhen used in isolation, none of the engagement tools were found to be more effective than traditional ways of communicating. Instead, information is more easily understood when communication style and engagement tools are specially selected for the audience and used in combination.\n\nPresented at the 52nd Congress of International Association of Hydrogeologists (IAH2025)",

    "title": "The role of copper in facilitating the invasion of sessile marine invertebrate communities by pests: effects of copper pulse frequency in developing assemblages",
    "description": "Disturbance events are thought to provide an opportunity for the colonisation and establishment of invasive species.  Contamination of coastal waters with copper from sewage outfall and antifouling paints may create a disturbance that favours the establishment of introduced sessile invertebrates.  This study examines if the frequency of experimentally applied doses of copper sulfate increases the abundance of introduced sessile invertebrate species within developing (2-weeks old) and established (9-months old) assemblages.  Responses to regular and irregularly applied doses of copper were also tested in developing assemblages.\n\nThis dataset gives the effects of copper pulse frequency on the number of native and introduced taxa within developing (2-weeks old) sessile invertebrate assemblages.  Studies were carried out over 16 weeks between October 2004 and January 2005 at two sites in Port Phillip Bay, Victoria; Workshops Jetty, Williamstown and Point Henry Pier.  Workshops Jetty is reported to have higher abundances of sessile invertebrates and is more polluted than Point Henry Pier, providing a comparison between sites with different community assemblages and environment conditions.  At Workshops Jetty, four treatments were tested: an undosed control, or copper pulses applied every 4, 3 or 2 weeks.  At Point Henry, the same treatments were applied, except for the copper pulse application every 3 weeks. Overall, this study found no evidence to support the hypothesis that disturbance facilitates invasions by introduced species. Disturbance had no effect on the proportion of introduced species and there were no clear differences in the responses on introduced and native species. Whether a species benefited from a disturbance appeared to depend more on its life history characteristics, rather than its point of origin.",

This flood has a 50% chance of being experienced at least once in a person's lifetime. The 1 in 100 AEP flood has been generally adopted in Australia and overseas as the basis for floodplain management planning.\n</li>\n<li>\n\nFloodplain - the portion of a river valley next to the river channel which is covered with water when the river overflows its banks during major river flows. The term also applies to land adjacent to estuaries which is subject to flooding.\n</li>\n<li>\n\nDesignated flood event (DFE) - used for planning purposes and is generally the 1 in 100 (1%) AEP \"designed\" flood event. However, a designated flood event could be based on an \"actual\" flood event (e.g. Moora 1999 flood event) or an alternative scenario (i.e. Yakamia Creek - 1 in 100 (1%) AEP flood event plus sea level rise).\n</li>\n<li>\n\nMaximum channel capacity (MCC) - the maximum flow that a waterway can contain before breaking out across the floodplain during a flood event. \n</li>\n<li>\n\nProbable maximum flood (PMF) - the largest flood that could conceivably occur at a particular location, resulting from probable maximum precipitation. The PMF defines the extent of flood-prone land. Generally, it is not physically or financially possible to provide general protection against this event.\n</li>\n<li>\n\nAustralian Height Datum (AHD) - is a geodetic datum for altitude measurement in Australia. It was adopted in 1971 by the National Mapping Council as the datum to which all vertical control for mapping is to be referred. The datum is based on the mean sea level (1966-1968) being assigned the value 0.000m on the Australian Height Datum (AHD) at 30 tide gauges around the coast of the Australian continent.\n</li>\n</ul>",

    "description": "This release consists of flux tower measurements of the exchange of energy and mass between the surface and the atmospheric boundary-layer using eddy covariance techniques. Data were processed using PyFluxPro (v3.4.7) as described by Isaac et al. (2017). PyFluxPro produces a final, gap-filled product with Net Ecosystem Exchange (NEE) partitioned into Gross Primary Productivity (GPP) and Ecosystem Respiration (ER).\n\nThe site is located on a low lying plain dominated by Mitchell Grass (<em>Astrebla</em> spp.). Elevation of the site is close to 250&nbsp;m and mean annual precipitation at a nearby Bureau of Meteorology site is 640&nbsp;mm. Maximum temperatures range from 28.4&nbsp;°C (in June/ July) to 39.1&nbsp;°C (in December), while minimum temperatures range from 11.2&nbsp;°C (in July) to 24.4&nbsp;°C (in December).\n\nThe instrument mast is 5&nbsp;m tall. Heat, water vapour and carbon dioxide measurements are taken using the open-path eddy flux technique. Temperature, humidity, wind speed, wind direction, rainfall and net radiation are measured. Soil heat fluxes are measured and soil moisture content is gathered using time domain reflectometry.\n\nAncillary measurements taken at the site include LAI, leaf-scale physiological properties (gas exchange, leaf isotope ratios, nitrogen and chlorophyll concentrations), vegetation optical properties and soil physical properties. Airborne based remote sensing (Lidar and hyperspectral measurements) was carried out at the site in September 2008. Biomass harvest measured: mean live biomass 0.00&nbsp;gm-2 (standard error: 0.00), mean standing dead biomass 163.42&nbsp;gm-2 (standard error: 16.73), mean litter biomass 148.99&nbsp;gm-2 (standard error: 21.32), total mean biomass 312.40&nbsp;gm-2 (standard error: 30.80). Soil consists of: clay 14.47%, silt 51.23%, sand 34.30%.",

    "description": "This record describes the Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler (ADCP) data collected from the Marine National Facility RV Investigator voyage IN2023_V04, titled: \"International nutrient inter-comparison study in the Southern Ocean: quantifying and identifying the causes of differences in dissolved inorganic nutrient datasets between global seagoing laboratories - Phase 2.\" The voyage took place between June 5, 2023 and June 18, 2023 (AEST), departing from Hobart and returning to Hobart. \nThe OS150 unit was run for the majority part of the voyage. The OS75 was running with three beams for the duration of the voyage. Experts at University of Hawaii determined that the fourth beam is broken and will require servicing by RDI to rectify. Additionally, some electrical noise was observed, to be further investigated when returning to port. Acceptable data was obtained using the three-beam solution, with a slightly compromised range of around 600m. It is recommended that the OS75 is operated as normal for all upcoming voyages.\nADCP data were collected using the University of Hawaii Data Acquisition System (UHDAS) and post-processed using the Common Ocean Data Access System (CODAS). Documentation for these systems can be found in (Hummon, 2009-2021).\nThis dataset was processed (quality-controlled), and then archived by the CSIRO National Collections and Marine Infrastructure (NCMI) Information and Data Centre (IDC).",

The voyage’s first leg transited from Hobart to Nuku’alofa (10–19 Aug 2025), where science participants boarded. A mid-voyage transfer occurred on 05 Sep, and all science personnel disembarked in Nuku’alofa on 23 Sep before the final transit to Brisbane (23 Sep–1 Oct 2025).\n\nThe Kongsberg SBP29 (sub bottom profiler) was used to acquire data containing the specular reflections at different sediment interfaces below the seafloor. The SBP120 provides a 3° by 3° angular resolution.\n\nThe echosounder's frequency sweep range is from 2.5 to 9 kHz. The SBP29 was logged continuously for the extent of the voyage.\n\nData are stored in <em>.raw (2002 files 22 GB) raw and </em>.seg (1991 files 21.9 GB) segy formats at CSIRO.\n\nThe segy format data had a real time processing stream applied, which applies gain, a gain correction, matched filter with replica shaping, an attribute calculation for instantaneous amplitude and time variable gain.\n\nAdditional information regarding this dataset is contained in the GSM data acquisition and processing report.

    "description": "With this proposal, we aim to continue P1032, the rapid measurements of relativistic parameters of southern binary pulsar systems using data from the Parkes Ultra Wideband Low (UWL) receiver. As the MeerTime project at the MeerKAT radio telescope ended in early 2024, observations with the UWL receiver now form the backbone for extending the timing baselines of many pulsars that have been part of this project. Since the source selection in the previous semesters was tailored such that the UWL receiver is the most (versatile and) suited instrument to achieve the proposed scientific goals for the chosen pulsars, we propose to continue these observations. We will use the UWL data to obtain significant orbital coverage and timing baselines on these pulsars and obtain important constraints on orbital and temporal DM variations that will help in identifying the nature of the companion stars. Increasing the number of measured Neutron Star (NS) masses, as well as improving on current constraints has profound implications for NS internal structure and for stellar and binary evolution physics.",

    "description": "Flow cytometry data was collected in September 2016, in waters off South Australia. \n\nThe general purpose of the study is to be able to establish background knowledge on the ecosystem on the continental shelf of South Australia and the impact of upwelling/saline outflow events on microbial communities to ultimately develop a biogeochemical model of the region. Sampling was carried out during cruises conducted on board the RV Ngerin as part of the Southern Australian Integrated Marine System (SAIMOS). During each cruise, the physical, chemical and biological properties of the chlorophyll fluorescence maximum (DCM) layer were investigated. Flow cytometry data has been collected for picophytoplankton, bacteria and viruses.\n\nSix main stations have been sampled over the course of the study, five are located on the 100 m isobath, i.e. RS (35.508S, 136.278E), B2 (35.418S, 136.148E), B3 (35.258S, 136.048E), B4 (35.168S, 135.418E) and B5 (35.008S, 135.198E), and one from an offshore station (B1; 36.188S, 136.178E) located southwest of Kangaroo Island. Note that combining the distances between stations (14–25 nautical miles), the average component of the current velocity at middepth along the shelf (0.01 m s21) and the average speed of the vessel (i.e. 9 knots) indicate that different water masses were sampled at each station. Additional samples have on occasion been collected from the National Reference Station (NRS) at Kangaroo Island (35.832S, 136.447E) and the SA Spencer Gulf Mouth Mooring (SAM8SG, 35.25S, 136.690E), where the saline outflow occurs.",

A synthesis of historical data sets for primary producers, sessile and mobile invertebrates and finfish were collected from the indicators region and an extensive review of potential indicators for finfish was also conducted  \n\nThe LTMP was implemented in April, May and June 2010. Sampling was conducted using baited remote underwater stereo-video to record the diversity, abundance and size-structure of the demersal fish assemblage. \n\nRaw video along with the processed data of MaxN and length of fish species were the data outcomes.\n\nWithin each location, sampling was targeted to habitats where previous studies have found to be representative of both fished and non-target species of the demersal fish assemblage.",

    "description": "This dataset presents the footprint of the number of installations of small generation unit (SGU) wind systems and their rated output in kilowatts (kW). The data spans the months of 2004 and includes the total for the year. The data is aggregated to Postal Areas (POAs) from the 2016 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nEvery month the Clean Energy Regulator (CER) publishes small-scale renewable energy installation data files. These data files provide a list of SGU (small-scale solar panel, wind and hydro systems) and kW capacity by installed postcode, and solar water heaters (SWH) and air source heat pumps by installed postcode. The data represents all systems that have had certificates validly created against them. The data includes new installations, upgrades to existing systems and stand-alone (off-grid) systems. This data is not publicly available via the Renewable Energy Certificate (REC) Registry and does not include systems that are pending registration or have been failed by the CER.\nFor further information about this dataset, visit the data source:Clean Energy Regulator - Postcode Data for Small-scale Installations.\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data by joining the data with the 2016 ASGS POAs\n\n\nMonthly installation data is provided for months where an installation was registered.\n\n\nThe data is current as at 30-09-2018.\n\n\nRenewable Energy Target (RET) legislation allows a 12 month creation period for registered persons to create their certificates.\n\n\nSmall-scale technology certificates are calculated based on the life of the system. This differs for solar hot water heaters and small generation units (solar panels, wind and hydro). Further information can be found at theRenewable Energy Target FAQ.\n\n\nCapacity data has been revised to account for past data entry errors which caused significant inconsistencies. These systems were installed between 2001 and 2003. As a result of this revision, the cumulative installed capacity from 2004 onwards has reduced by 5.517MW.\n\n",

One aspect of the surveys in Tasmania is to look at deepwater benthic assemblages associated with rocky reefs. These dives featured broad grids over the dive sites and a pair of dense overlapping grids. Around the Tasman peninsula, dives were completed in shallower water and featured a pair of dense grids connected by reciprocal legs. Two sites near the Nuggets and in the Freycinet MPA were revisited from previous trips in 2008 and 2009. These were broad grids and did not feature any dense grids making direct comparison difficult.",

The area surveyed is to the immediate south-east of those surveyed in 1950 and 1951 and includes the Federal open-cut, Dunn's workings and Stebbin's Hill. Self-potential and magnetic methods, which had proved satisfactory in the previous surveys were again used. Of five main anomalies which were found, three coincide with known workings, namely the Federal open-cut, Dunn's workings and Montana South workings. These anomalies do not indicate any considerable extension of the ore bodies already worked. Of the other two anomalies, one is slightly north-west of Dunn's workings and the other directly on Stebbin's Hill. Three drilling sites are recommended for testing these two anomalies.",

    "description": "Parasmittina delicatula colonies were located on the Queenscliff pier in early 1999 and assigned to a small size class (10-15mm) or large size class (30mm or more). Each colony was 'damaged' by scraping colony parts according to assigned treatment. The treatments were large control (>30mm diameter), large fragment with edge intact, large fragment with edge removed, central fragment and small control (see attached resource for more details). Colonies were photographed in situ with an underwater camera using slide film at intervals of 1, 2, 3, 4 and 8 months. A total of 47 established colonies were photographed over the 8 month period. In the laboratory, the slides were projected onto graph paper, and the outlines of the colonies traced. The images were then scanned and colony survival, mortality, size, growth and fragmentation were recorded using SigmaScan 2.0.",

Download speed, upload speed, and latency are collected via the Speedtest by Ookla applications for Android and iOS and averaged for each tile. Measurements are filtered to results containing GPS-quality location accuracy.\nFor more information please see the Ookla Github repository or the Registry of Open Data on AWS.\nOokla licenses data to NGOs and educational institutions to fulfill its mission: to help make the internet better, faster and more accessible for everyone. Ookla hopes to further this mission by distributing the data to make it easier for individuals and organizations to use it for the purposes of bridging the social and economic gaps between those with and without modern Internet access.\nAURIN has generated a subset corresponding to the intersection with the extent of Australia. It was then reprojected from EPSG 4326 (WGS84) to 4283 (GDA94).",

    "description": "MacGillivray Reef (formerly known as Shadwell Reef) is located in the Northern Great Barrier Reef province, approximately 270km north of Cairns. Reef drilling was undertaken to investigate the Holocene evolution of the reef using radiocarbon dating of the cored coral material.\n\nTwo windward and two leeward cores were recovered from MacGillivray Reef. Two of the cores were initiated through thrown up coral blocks on the leeward margin which allowed a longer drilling window during the tidal range. Cores Mac 3 and 5 were abandoned due to the rising tide and equipment failure respectively; Mac 4 was abandoned after encountering a thick sand layer. The maximum depth reached was 11 m and 15 m an the windward and leeward margins respectively.\n\nThe cores were logged and photographed, and thin sections were made and petrographically examined. Corals that were determined to be in situ (by the orientation of their corallites) and free from internal cement and detritus by microscope examination were selected for radiocarbon dating.\n\nRadiocarbon dating suggests that MacGillivray platform reef developed on a topographic high, which is assumed to be granite, at a depth of 15 m below the reef flat approximately 8.2 cal kyr BP. The reef only approached present day sea-level within the last 500 years (260 - 80 cal yr BP). Rates of vertical accretion ranged from 1.4 to 5.8 m/kyr.",

    "description": "The Rental Report time series dataset provides detailed time-series statistics for some key Rental Report data from the March quarter of 2000 to the December quarter of 2017. This specific dataset presents statistics on affordable 3 bedroom rental properties by the 2016 Local Government Areas geographic level.\nAffordable rental properties are those within 30 per cent of gross income for low-income households. The rental thresholds are taken from the household incomes for whom that number of bedrooms is a minimum: \n\n\nFor one-bedroom properties, we have taken the income of singles on Newstart allowance;\n\n\nFor two-bedroom properties, we have taken a single parent pensioner with one child aged under 5;\n\n\nFor three-bedroom properties, we have taken a couple on Newstart with two children;\n\n\nFor four-bedroom properties, we have taken a couple on Newstart with four children.\n\n\nThe Rental Report provides the most accurate information on the private rental market in Victoria. The data come from records kept by the Residential Tenancies Bond Authority (RTBA). The RTBA is responsible for receiving, registering and refunding all bonds associated with private residential leases in Victoria.\nFor more information please visit the Department of Health and Human Services.",

    "description": "A quantitative pilot study of the composition of the benthic community of macro-invertebrates on intertidal rocky platforms was undertaken to: \n\na) provide detailed information on variation in biodiversity along the length of the Ningaloo Marine Park; and \nb) determine the appropriate design of a monitoring protocol powerful enough to determine predefined levels of change.  \n\nThese general overall aims were in the context of the Ningaloo Marine Park Draft Management Plan of 2004, which set out a vision of maintaining the ecological values in the Park, and protecting it from adverse human impacts.\n\nSampling was conducted at 35 sites from July 2007 and September 2010 between the northernmost site of Mildura Wreck and southernmost site of 3 Mile Out 2.\n\n\nData for the project includes:\n1. All species data for each 1m2 quadrat (1744 quadrats x 291 species): [WAMSI3.2.2bQuadratDataMay2012]\n\n2. Lengths of small giant clams (Tridacna maxima) mapped at 20 sites (3119 rows x 11 columns including identifying information for each length):\n[WAMSI3.2.2bGiantClams.csv]\n\n3. Physical features of the platforms in three files (32 rows x 13, 11, 10 columns):\n[WAMSI3.2.2bPlatformAttributes.csv] \n[WAMSI3.2.2bPlatformQuantative.csv] \n[WAMSI3.2.2bFetchAndContour.csv]\n\n4. GPS readings as UTM values for locations of transects used to map positions of Tridacna maxima (giant clams) (404 rows x 6 columns, including sample identification information):\n[WAMSI3.2.2bTridacnaUTM.csv]\n\n5. Location of research sites - Google Earth .kmz files: \nCenters of 36 sites where quadrat samples were taken 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010 and reported on in all the Research Chapters, and where physical data for Research Chapter 8 were collected.\n[WAMSI3.2.2b Sites.kmz]\n\nCorners of 8 sites at northern boundary of Jurabi Sanctuary Zone where data for Research Chapter 9\n[WAMSI3.2.2bJurabi8Sites.kmz]\n\nShoreward, southern corners of Transect 1 and some others for areas where Tridacna maxima were measured as reported in Research Chapter 4.\n[WAMSI3.2.2bGiantClams.kmz]\n\n6. Text and images about the 32 sites sampled in 2007 and 2009\n[WAMSI3.2.2bSitePages.rtf]\n\n\nData files come with metadata / descriptions of the column titles and codes.",

    "description": "This dataset presents the footprint of the number of installations of solar water heater (SWH) air source heat pump systems. The data spans the months of 2008 and includes a total for the year. The data is aggregated to Postal Areas (POAs) from the 2016 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nEvery month the Clean Energy Regulator (CER) publishes small-scale renewable energy installation data files. These data files provide a list of small generation units (SGU) (small-scale solar panel, wind and hydro systems) and kW capacity by installed postcode, and SWH and air source heat pumps by installed postcode. The data represents all systems that have had certificates validly created against them. The data includes new installations, upgrades to existing systems and stand-alone (off-grid) systems. This data is not publicly available via the Renewable Energy Certificate (REC) Registry and does not include systems that are pending registration or have been failed by the CER.\nFor further information about this dataset, visit the data source:Clean Energy Regulator - Postcode Data for Small-scale Installations.\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data by joining the data with the 2016 ASGS POAs\n\n\nThe data is current as at 30-09-2018.\n\n\nRenewable Energy Target (RET) legislation allows a 12 month creation period for registered persons to create their certificates.\n\n\nSmall-scale technology certificates are calculated based on the life of the system. This differs for solar hot water heaters and small generation units (solar panels, wind and hydro). Further information can be found at theRenewable Energy Target FAQ.\n\n\nAir source heat pumps were introduced into the Small-scale Renewable Energy Scheme in 2005 as such there is no installation data available pre-2005 for this fuel source.\n\n",

    "description": "This dataset presents the footprint of the number of installations of solar water heater (SWH) air source heat pump systems. The data spans the months of 2009 and includes a total for the year. The data is aggregated to Postal Areas (POAs) from the 2016 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nEvery month the Clean Energy Regulator (CER) publishes small-scale renewable energy installation data files. These data files provide a list of small generation units (SGU) (small-scale solar panel, wind and hydro systems) and kW capacity by installed postcode, and SWH and air source heat pumps by installed postcode. The data represents all systems that have had certificates validly created against them. The data includes new installations, upgrades to existing systems and stand-alone (off-grid) systems. This data is not publicly available via the Renewable Energy Certificate (REC) Registry and does not include systems that are pending registration or have been failed by the CER.\nFor further information about this dataset, visit the data source:Clean Energy Regulator - Postcode Data for Small-scale Installations.\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data by joining the data with the 2016 ASGS POAs\n\n\nThe data is current as at 30-09-2018.\n\n\nRenewable Energy Target (RET) legislation allows a 12 month creation period for registered persons to create their certificates.\n\n\nSmall-scale technology certificates are calculated based on the life of the system. This differs for solar hot water heaters and small generation units (solar panels, wind and hydro). Further information can be found at theRenewable Energy Target FAQ.\n\n\nAir source heat pumps were introduced into the Small-scale Renewable Energy Scheme in 2005 as such there is no installation data available pre-2005 for this fuel source.\n\n",

    "title": "Integrated Heat Vulnerability Index for Culturally and Linguistically Diverse (CALD) and Non-CALD Populations (2021)",
    "description": "This dataset provides a composite measure of heat vulnerability for Culturally and Linguistically Diverse (CALD) populations in Australia, integrating three key indicators: heat exposure, heat sensibility, and heat adaptive capability. Derived from social and environmental variables in CALD-specific AURIN datasets, it provides data for 2001, 2011, 2016, and 2021, utilising the 2021 SA1 boundaries to enable retrospective comparison. This framework allows for the assessment of heat vulnerability trends across diverse neighbourhoods, supporting targeted strategies for mitigating heat-related risks and fostering resilience and equity in urban environments.\nEffective Use Case Descriptions:\nHeat Vulnerability Assessment and Planning: Urban planners and environmental agencies can use the Integrated Heat Vulnerability Index to identify and prioritise CALD and non-CALD neighbourhoods most at risk from heat-related impacts. By analysing the index, they can develop targeted heat mitigation strategies such as enhancing green spaces, improving building insulation, or increasing access to cooling centres. This data-driven approach ensures resources are allocated effectively to areas with the highest vulnerability.\nPublic Health Interventions: Public health officials can utilise the heat vulnerability index to assess the risk of heat-related health issues in different neighbourhoods. By integrating indicators of heat exposure, sensibility, and adaptive capability, health agencies can design and implement targeted outreach programs, heat-health warnings, and community support initiatives to protect vulnerable populations during extreme heat events. \nClimate Adaptation Strategies: Climate resilience experts can apply the index to evaluate the effectiveness of past and current climate adaptation measures. By comparing heat vulnerability trends over time, they can identify gaps in adaptive capacity and recommend improvements to climate resilience strategies. This helps ensure that adaptation efforts are addressing the needs of the most affected communities. \nPolicy Development and Advocacy: Policymakers and advocacy groups can leverage the data to support evidence-based policy development and advocate for climate justice. The index provides a clear picture of how heat vulnerability varies across neighbourhoods, allowing for the formulation of policies that address inequities and promote inclusive urban planning. It can also be used to justify funding for heat mitigation and adaptation projects in vulnerable areas.\nCommunity Engagement and Education: Community organisations can use the heat vulnerability index to raise awareness about heat risks and promote community-driven solutions. By sharing insights on heat exposure and adaptive capabilities, these organisations can empower residents to participate in local heat resilience initiatives and advocate for improvements in their neighbourhoods. \nResearch and Academic Studies: Researchers can use the index to study the relationship between heat vulnerability and various socio-environmental factors. The longitudinal data enables analyses of how changes in urban development, demographic shifts, and climate change impact heat vulnerability over time, contributing to the broader understanding of environmental justice and urban resilience.",

    "title": "ACTGOV UHCP Urban Habitat Connectivity - Fragmentation",
    "description": "Urban Habitat Connectivity Project (UHCP)\n\nShort description: A package of data containing potential habitat and fragmentation for seven species groups in the urban ACT. Each species group has two layer files. Connected habitat layers show potential core and corridor habitat for the species group, and connectivity/fragmentation between these habitat patches. Remnant patches layers contain areas which are predicted to be fragmented and inaccessible for the species group, but may be important for restoration activities. These layers are outputs of ecological connectivity modelling and have been developed using spatial data representing habitat and connectivity requirements specific to the species group.\n\nThe following attributes are available in the data table for Connected Habitat layers:\n\n\n<ul><li>Species Group* - indicates the species group of interest</li><li>Patch ID – a unique identifier for each ‘patch’ of connected habitat, an ID that is given to group all habitat areas which are predicted to be connected to each other.</li><li>Habitat Type* – identifies if the polygon meets core or corridor habitat requirements, or if it is a remnant patch.</li><li>Habitat Number – a numeric value linked to Habitat Type to support statistics and symbology. Core habitat has a value of 0 and corridor habitat has a value of 1.</li><li>Patch Area (Ha)* – the area of the individual polygon in hectares.</li><li>Connected Habitat Area (Ha) – the total area of potential habitat in the connected patch, determined by summing the Patch Area for all polygons with the same Patch ID.</li><li>Shape area – the polygon’s area, calculated by default in meters squared.</li><li>Shape length – the length of the line enclosing the polygon, calculated by default in meters squared.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n* Is also available in the data table for Remnant Patches layers.\n\nSpatial resolution: 1:10,000\n\nCoordinate system: GDA2020 MGA zone 55\n\nMETHODS\n\nData collection / creation: <a>Spatial layers for habitat and barriers were created and input into a habitat connectivity/fragmentation model specifically designed for the species group. The model was developed using metrics derived from expert elicitation. These metrics quantified essential habitat and connectivity requirements for the species group, for example the preferred spacing of trees, the maximum crossable width of a road, the typical dispersal distance, etc. </a>The model identified habitat and barriers to connectivity, based on the metrics which could be mapped. Habitat was delineated by patch size to determine core and corridor habitat, and to remove areas which are too small to be functional. The habitat type is visible in the attribute table of the data.\n\nConnectivity between habitat patches is dependent on the species group’s dispersal capacity and the availability of core habitat, suitable corridors and a path without barriers. To assess this core habitat areas were buffered by the species group’s dispersal distance. This identified how far an individual will move to find a new core habitat patch. Movement to this distance is dependent on a suitable path. All habitat was buffered by the distance the species can move outside habitat (through non-habitat areas). This identified how far an individual will move outside any habitat (core or corridor) before they require another habitat patch (i.e. how far they can travel between stepping stones).Connectivity is further complicated by impassable barriers. Barriers were used to slice up the dispersal buffers and identify ‘dispersal patches’, areas which an individual can move within. Fragmentation is seen when a barrier is present, patches are too far from core habitat, or corridor habitat is too far apart.\n\nA unique ID was applied to each patch and represents connectivity/fragmentation. The patches were intersected with habitat to apply the new ID to the habitat areas. The final model outputs identify areas of potential core, corridor or remnant (inaccessible) habitat. Core and corridor habitat are viewable in the connected habitat dataset, whilst remnant patches are available separately. The data was simplified using the Douglas-Peuker algorithm, a tolerance of 0.5-2m, minimum size of 2-5m2 for retention, and holes filled in if less than 20m2. Small adjoining slithers &lt;20m2 were dissolved into neighbouring polygons to optimise drawing speeds. Please contact the project team for the model script or further details on the methodology.\n\nNOTES ON USE\n\nQuality: The habitat connectivity modelling used to produce the data was informed by work by the City of Melbourne <a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/331035992_Linking_Nature_in_the_City_A_framework_for_improving_ecological_connectivity_across_the_City_of_Melbourne\">(Kirk et al., 2018)</a>. The original methods were expanded on, with habitat and connectivity requirements (metrics) specific to the species group determined from expert elicitation and further analysis to consider patch size for core or corridor patches. The expert elicitation process provided the best and most relevant quantitative description of habitat and barriers available (for a species group rather than a specific species). The input datasets were then tailored to the metrics for this project. Existing datasets were refined to be relevant and reflect the metrics identified through expert elicitation. New datasets were created where data was missing. All data was derived from existing authoritative sources and/or remotely sensed data. This data curation process ensured the input datasets, and resulting output, were relevant and fit for purpose.\n\nLimitations: This data should be considered indicative only as there are limitations to the modelling process. It considers all habitat and barriers equally and as discrete objects (i.e. it applies a discrete boundary around a patch and does not account for gradients or flexible boundaries).The model predicts habitat and connectivity based on the data available. It does not assess whether a species is present or consider temporal variability. Some habitat requirements are not mapped (e.g. native vegetation, lack of predators) due to the lack of an accurate or complete dataset. Some of these requirements are critical to the success of the species group. These habitat requirements are available and have been derived from expert elicitation. They should be considered at an area of interest.\n\nThe model assumes the input data is up to date and accurate. Many of the habitat and barrier datasets used as inputs into the models are in some way informed by remote sensing data. Remote sensing data has limitations, such as potential for misclassification (e.g. bare ground and pavement could be confused). Additionally, remotely sensed data captures a point in time and will become outdated. Manual checks and improvements using supplementary data for specific sites have been completed to reduce as much error as possible.\n\nData refinement: Unmapped habitat and connectivity requirements should be considered when using the data. The full list of known habitat and connectivity requirements for each species group, including those considered by the model and those unaccounted for, is available by request. Other data may also be used to track changes post-LiDAR capture. For example, new development footprints may be used to remove non-habitat areas and can be done so at a faster rate than waiting for new LiDAR captures and re-running the model.\n\n\n\nSHARING\n\nLicenses/restrictions on use: Creative Commons By Attribution 4.0 (Australian Capital Territory)\n\nHow to cite this data: ACT Government, 2023.

    "description": "AUV Sirius (IMOS Platform code: SIRIUS) was deployed in tScott Reef in July 2009.\n\nScott Reef, WA (Heyward, Cooper, Radford, Colquhoun ‐ AIMS): The primary objective of work completed in July/August 2009 was to describe biological assemblages associated with deep coral reef systems at Scott Reef in WA. A significant proportion of South Scott Reef and the adjacent lagoon lies in waters between 30 m to 70 m deep that support a range of habitats similar to many of the submerged shoal systems strung along the edge of the continental shelf in the Timor Sea. The South Scott Reef lagoon covers 300 km^2 and is the largest area of this type observed on a single reef system in the NW region. Understanding the nature and dynamics of these deeper water areas will not only better describe the true extent of Australia’s tropical reef resources, but will contribute to a broader understanding of the overall resilience of coral reefs in the NW region. In order to produce an accurate, high resolution habitat map of the deeper reef waters and to establish viable deep water monitoring sites, high resolution acoustic mapping using digital mulitbeam from Geoscience Australia was completed in parallel with  collecting georeferenced seabed images using the AUV Sirius and the existing AIMS towed video with high resolution stills systems. AUV deployments consisted of 19 dives over 12 days of operation onboard the R/V Solander using a mix of survey designs and illustrated the vehicle's reliability and versatility as a complementary habitat characterisation tool. On several occasions the vehicle operated beyond tracking range of the supporting vessel for extended periods facilitating the execution of other scientific objectives, particularly swath bathymetric mapping of the Scott Reef lagoon.",

    "description": "Urban Habitat Connectivity Project (UHCP)\n\nShort description: A package of data containing potential habitat and fragmentation for seven species groups in the urban ACT. Each species group has two layer files. Connected habitat layers show potential core and corridor habitat for the species group, and connectivity/fragmentation between these habitat patches. Remnant patches layers contain areas which are predicted to be fragmented and inaccessible for the species group, but may be important for restoration activities. These layers are outputs of ecological connectivity modelling and have been developed using spatial data representing habitat and connectivity requirements specific to the species group.\n\nThe following attributes are available in the data table for Connected Habitat layers:\n\n\n<ul><li>Species Group* - indicates the species group of interest</li><li>Patch ID – a unique identifier for each ‘patch’ of connected habitat, an ID that is given to group all habitat areas which are predicted to be connected to each other.</li><li>Habitat Type* – identifies if the polygon meets core or corridor habitat requirements, or if it is a remnant patch.</li><li>Habitat Number – a numeric value linked to Habitat Type to support statistics and symbology. Core habitat has a value of 0 and corridor habitat has a value of 1.</li><li>Patch Area (Ha)* – the area of the individual polygon in hectares.</li><li>Connected Habitat Area (Ha) – the total area of potential habitat in the connected patch, determined by summing the Patch Area for all polygons with the same Patch ID.</li><li>Shape area – the polygon’s area, calculated by default in meters squared.</li><li>Shape length – the length of the line enclosing the polygon, calculated by default in meters squared.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n* Is also available in the data table for Remnant Patches layers.\n\nSpatial resolution: 1:10,000\n\nCoordinate system: GDA2020 MGA zone 55\n\nMETHODS\n\nData collection / creation: <a>Spatial layers for habitat and barriers were created and input into a habitat connectivity/fragmentation model specifically designed for the species group. The model was developed using metrics derived from expert elicitation. These metrics quantified essential habitat and connectivity requirements for the species group, for example the preferred spacing of trees, the maximum crossable width of a road, the typical dispersal distance, etc. </a>The model identified habitat and barriers to connectivity, based on the metrics which could be mapped. Habitat was delineated by patch size to determine core and corridor habitat, and to remove areas which are too small to be functional. The habitat type is visible in the attribute table of the data.\n\nConnectivity between habitat patches is dependent on the species group’s dispersal capacity and the availability of core habitat, suitable corridors and a path without barriers. To assess this core habitat areas were buffered by the species group’s dispersal distance. This identified how far an individual will move to find a new core habitat patch. Movement to this distance is dependent on a suitable path. All habitat was buffered by the distance the species can move outside habitat (through non-habitat areas). This identified how far an individual will move outside any habitat (core or corridor) before they require another habitat patch (i.e. how far they can travel between stepping stones).Connectivity is further complicated by impassable barriers. Barriers were used to slice up the dispersal buffers and identify ‘dispersal patches’, areas which an individual can move within. Fragmentation is seen when a barrier is present, patches are too far from core habitat, or corridor habitat is too far apart.\n\nA unique ID was applied to each patch and represents connectivity/fragmentation. The patches were intersected with habitat to apply the new ID to the habitat areas. The final model outputs identify areas of potential core, corridor or remnant (inaccessible) habitat. Core and corridor habitat are viewable in the connected habitat dataset, whilst remnant patches are available separately. The data was simplified using the Douglas-Peuker algorithm, a tolerance of 0.5-2m, minimum size of 2-5m2 for retention, and holes filled in if less than 20m2. Small adjoining slithers &lt;20m2 were dissolved into neighbouring polygons to optimise drawing speeds. Please contact the project team for the model script or further details on the methodology.\n\nNOTES ON USE\n\nQuality: The habitat connectivity modelling used to produce the data was informed by work by the City of Melbourne <a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/331035992_Linking_Nature_in_the_City_A_framework_for_improving_ecological_connectivity_across_the_City_of_Melbourne\">(Kirk et al., 2018)</a>. The original methods were expanded on, with habitat and connectivity requirements (metrics) specific to the species group determined from expert elicitation and further analysis to consider patch size for core or corridor patches. The expert elicitation process provided the best and most relevant quantitative description of habitat and barriers available (for a species group rather than a specific species). The input datasets were then tailored to the metrics for this project. Existing datasets were refined to be relevant and reflect the metrics identified through expert elicitation. New datasets were created where data was missing. All data was derived from existing authoritative sources and/or remotely sensed data. This data curation process ensured the input datasets, and resulting output, were relevant and fit for purpose.\n\nLimitations: This data should be considered indicative only as there are limitations to the modelling process. It considers all habitat and barriers equally and as discrete objects (i.e. it applies a discrete boundary around a patch and does not account for gradients or flexible boundaries).The model predicts habitat and connectivity based on the data available. It does not assess whether a species is present or consider temporal variability. Some habitat requirements are not mapped (e.g. native vegetation, lack of predators) due to the lack of an accurate or complete dataset. Some of these requirements are critical to the success of the species group. These habitat requirements are available and have been derived from expert elicitation. They should be considered at an area of interest.\n\nThe model assumes the input data is up to date and accurate. Many of the habitat and barrier datasets used as inputs into the models are in some way informed by remote sensing data. Remote sensing data has limitations, such as potential for misclassification (e.g. bare ground and pavement could be confused). Additionally, remotely sensed data captures a point in time and will become outdated. Manual checks and improvements using supplementary data for specific sites have been completed to reduce as much error as possible.\n\nData refinement: Unmapped habitat and connectivity requirements should be considered when using the data. The full list of known habitat and connectivity requirements for each species group, including those considered by the model and those unaccounted for, is available by request. Other data may also be used to track changes post-LiDAR capture. For example, new development footprints may be used to remove non-habitat areas and can be done so at a faster rate than waiting for new LiDAR captures and re-running the model.\n\n\n\nSHARING\n\nLicenses/restrictions on use: Creative Commons By Attribution 4.0 (Australian Capital Territory)\n\nHow to cite this data: ACT Government, 2023.

    "description": "This study examined stomach contents of shrimp sampled in the beam trawls in Western Port Bay from July 1977 to January 1980 (see parent record 'The ecology and trophic role of caridean shrimps in the eelgrass community of Western Port, Victoria', File identifier: 268431c0-f18e-11dc-aaae-00188b4c0af8). An evaluation was made of summer and winter diets of Macrobrachium.intermedium, Pontophilus intermedius and Hippolyte caradina. Chlorotocella leptorhyncus was not present in the summer samples, so only the winter diet of this species was determined. Food items in the stomach were identified and the size of intact specimens was measured. All items were counted and assigned to a taxonomic category at the lowest possible level. The relative volume of individual prey items and taxonomic groups was also estimated.\n \nDuring summer, M.intermediaum fed on a mix of animals (small crustaceans, gastropods, and polychaetes) and plant matter, and during winter, the diet was mostly plant matter. Polychaetes were the abundant prey items in the stomachs of P.intermedius, representing close to 70% of the diet in summer and winter. Almost 70% of the overall volume of food consumed by H.caradina was plant matter with small crustaceans, gastropods and insects making up the remaining proportion of the food consumed. The amount of plant matter in the diet increased in the winter months. C.leptorhyncus was found to ingest approximately equal volumes of animal and planter material with polychaetes the most abundant animal prey. The plant matter found in all samples was mostly dead eelgrass tissue.",

The data spans the years 2006-2010 and is aggregated to 2015 Department of Health Primary Health Network (PHN) areas, based on the 2011 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nIncidence data refer to the number of new cases of cancer diagnosed in a given time period. It does not refer to the number of people newly diagnosed (because one person can be diagnosed with more than one cancer in a year). Cancer incidence data come from the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare (AIHW) 2012 Australian Cancer Database (ACD).\nFor further information about this dataset, please visit:\n\n\nAustralian Institute of Health and Welfare - Cancer Incidence and Mortality Across Regions (CIMAR) books.\n\n\nAustralian Cancer Database 2012 Data Quality Statement.\n\n\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data using the Department of Health - PHN Areas.\n\n\nDue to changes in geographic classifications over time, long-term trends are not available.\n\n\nValues assigned to \"n.p.\" in the original data have been removed from the data.\n\n\nThe Australian and jurisdictional totals include people who could not be assigned a PHN. The number of people who could not be assigned a PHN is less than 1% of the total.\n\n\nThe Australian total also includes residents of Other Territories (Cocos (Keeling) Islands, Christmas Island and Jervis Bay Territory).\n\n\nThe ACD records all primary cancers except for basal and squamous cell carcinomas of the skin (BCCs and SCCs). These cancers are not notifiable diseases and are not collected by the state and territory cancer registries.\n\n\nThe diseases coded to ICD-10 codes D45-D46, D47.1 and D47.3-D47.5, which cover most of the myelodysplastic and myeloproliferative cancers, were not considered cancer at the time the ICD-10 was first published and were not routinely registered by all Australian cancer registries. The ACD contains all cases of these cancers which were diagnosed from 1982 onwards and which have been registered but the collection is not considered complete until 2003 onwards.\n\n\nNote that the incidence data presented are for 2006-2010 because 2011 and 2012 data for NSW and ACT were not able to be provided for the 2012 ACD.\n\n",

    "title": "Seabed environments and shallow geology of the Leveque Shelf, Browse Basin, Western Australia: seabed sediment laser measured grainsize data",
    "description": "In May 2013, Geoscience Australia, in collaboration with the Australian Institute of Marine Science, undertook a marine survey of the Leveque Shelf (survey number SOL5754/GA0340), a sub-basin of the Browse Basin. This survey provides seabed and shallow geological information to support an assessment of the CO2 storage potential of the Browse sedimentary basin. The basin, located on the Northwest Shelf, Western Australia, was previously identified by the Carbon Storage Taskforce (2009) as potentially suitable for CO2 storage. The survey was undertaken under the Australian Government's National CO2 Infrastructure Plan (NCIP) to help identify sites suitable for the long term storage of CO2 within reasonable distances of major sources of CO2 emissions. The principal aim of the Leveque Shelf marine survey was to look for evidence of any past or current gas or fluid seepage at the seabed, and to determine whether these features are related to structures (e.g. faults) in the Leveque Shelf area that may extend to the seabed. The survey also mapped seabed habitats and biota to provide information on communities and biophysical features that may be associated with seepage. This research, combined with deeper geological studies undertaken concurrently, addresses key questions on the potential for containment of CO2 in the basin's proposed CO2 storage unit, i.e. the basal sedimentary section (Late Jurassic and Early Cretaceous), and the regional integrity of the Heyward Formation (the seal unit overlying the main reservoir). The survey collected one hundred and eleven seabed sediment samples that were analysed for their grain size, textural composition and carbonate content. This dataset includes the results of grain size analysis measured by laser diffractometer.\n\nYou can also purchase hard copies of Geoscience Australia data and other products at http://www.ga.gov.au/products-services/how-to-order-products/sales-centre.html",

The data spans the year of 2012 and is aggregated by Local Government Areas (LGA) from the 2011 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nThe On Track Survey is conducted in April-May and involves a short telephone survey of school leavers who attended school in the previous year and who agreed to participate in the survey. Results for individual schools are usually published in June of the survey year.\nThe On Track survey seeks to: \n\n\nOffer a consistent and comprehensive approach to monitoring the transitions of school leavers.\n\n\nReport the information to schools, TAFE institutions and other education providers, organisations concerned with assisting young people, policy makers, parents and students.\n\n\nProvide detailed analyses of the transitions experienced by different groups of leavers.\n\n\nEnable education providers to use the findings to monitor and improve their programs.\n\n\nProvide a referral service for school leavers who appear to be experiencing difficulties in the transitions process.\n\n",

    "description": "A Vaisala WXT520 integrated weather station has been installed on RP5, a 6m steel pole, which has been installed within the lagoon of Heron Island as part of the sensor network infrastructure at Heron Island in the southern Great Barrier Reef off Gladstone, Australia.\n\nThe sensor-relay pole provides a platform for the installation of sensors to measure and monitor water conditions within the lagoon of Heron Island. The pole has real time communications using 900MHz spread spectrum radio back to a base station on Heron Island.\n\nThe weather station provides measurement of air temperature (Deg. C.), humidity as relative percent, barometric pressure (milliBars or hPa), rainfall amount, intensity and duration, hail amount, intensity and duration (not common on coral reefs!) and wind speed and direction. The wind speed and direction and processed into scalar and vector (directional) based readings and presented as 10 and 30 minute averages to give mean values and maximum values. From these you can get the average wind conditions at either 10 minute or 30 minute periods as well as the gust or maximum wind conditions.\n\nThe weather station is connected via an SDI-12 interface to a Campbell Scientific CR1000 logger which uses a RF411 radio to transmit the data, every 10 minutes, to the base station on Heron Island and then a Telstra nextG link is used to send the data back to AIMS.\n\nIdentical weather stations are also on One Tree Island (near by), Orpheus Island (central GBR) and Lizard Island (northern GBR). A light sensor is also located on the Island itself to give measures of PAR.",

    "description": "Coastal ocean surface radar is a land-based technique which uses scattering from the rough sea surface to obtain echoes which are Doppler shifted by the dynamics of the sea.  It has been shown (Crombie, 1955) that the scatter is predominantly a Bragg interaction between the radio wave and the sea surface gravity wave that is propagating in the same direction and with half the wavelength of the radio wave.  This Bragg interaction gives two strong first-order lines in the echo spectrum; one from the resonant gravity wave moving radially away from the station, and one from the resonant gravity wave moving towards the station.\n\nDirection-finding systems determine the azimuthal direction of a source point by comparing amplitude and phase signals on crossed loop receive antennas. The direction finding calculation is done on Doppler shift spectra for a specified range which includes return echoes from all azimuths.  This means that the spectra are spread and second-order echoes from one direction are swamped by the first-order echoes from other directions.  Consequently, parameter extraction using second-order echoes is not possible on a routine basis.  Directional wave spectra at the location of each radar station are produced by analysing the full azimuthal spread of first-order echo amplitudes, and wind directions are derived across the grid points by taking the ratio of the positive and negative Bragg echoes.\n\nSeaSonde HF ocean radar stations are used on the Turquoise Coast (Seabird and Cervantes), Western Australia, and on the Bonney Coast (Nora Creina and Blackfellows Cave), South Australia.",

    "description": "We request time to observe 270 pulsars on a regular basis in order to achieve three main science goals. The first is to understand pulsars: how do they spin down and what disrupts this process, how and why their profiles vary with time, whether they precess or have planetary mass companions, in short all the things that make pulsar timing noisier than the perfect clock. Secondly we want to understand the interstellar medium of our Galaxy through repeated monitoring of dispersion measure, rotation measure and flux density variations in conjunction with scintillation parameters. Finally, we provide these data as a community service both to the high-energy community where we have strong collaborative links (particularly to Fermi) and to the radio pulsar astronomers generally through the CSIRO archive. The project is on-going since 2007, we are (co-)authors on 106 papers arising from the P574 data. The data have contributed to the PhD theses of students from Bordeaux, Manchester, Oxford, Stanford, and Swinburne. We are seeking long-term project status with a view to continuing the project into the SKA era.",

    "description": "PSR J1227-6208 is a recycled pulsar in a bianry with a massive white dwarf companion. A recent timing measurement from combined MeerKAT and Parkes observations shows the companion mass to be between 1.2 and 1.5 $M_\\odot$, very close to the Chandrasekhar, resulting in potential profound physical implications. However, the timing precision is limited by the DM timing noise. We propose regular monitoring of this pulsar with the Parkes UWL receiver in conjunction with MeerKAT observations during the following four years. The joint monitoring will significantly improve the constraints on the Post-Keplerian parameters, with Parkes observations contributing to constrain the DM noise due to its large frequency bandwidth. These observations will be added to the already existing 11-year-long timing baseline, of which the later 5 years already include high-precision MeerKAT data and Parkes UWL data. After four years of further timing with the inclusion of UWL observatiosn, we predict an uncertainty on the masses smaller than 0.01 solar masses based on simulations. If UWL is not included, the mass uncertanites may saturate on their current values.",

It shows number of jobs and number of business establishments by business size, classified by their CLUE industry, ANZSIC1 and CLUE small area allocation.\nBusiness size is determined by the total number of jobs at ech business establishment and is categorised as follows:\nNon employing, no jobs allocated to the establishment.Small business, 1 to 19 jobs employed at a business establishment.Medium business, 20 to 199 jobs employed at a business establishment.Larger business, 200 or more jobs employed at a business establishment.\nThis dataset has been confidentialised to protect the commercially sensitive information of individual businesses. Data in cells which pertain to two or fewer businesses have been suppressed and are shown as a blank cell. The 'City of Melbourne' row totals refer to the true total, including those suppressed cells.Non-confidentialised data may be made available subject to a data supply agreement.

The data has been joined with LGA 2011 boundaries. \nFor more information visit the Victorian Commission for Gambling and Liquor Regulation's (VCGLR) website.\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data.\n\n\nEGM Numbers: a venue may be operating less machines than its licensed or attached numbers\n\n\nGaming Machine Density calculations are based on operating gaming machines with attached entitlements divided by adult population divided by 1,000 (gaming machines per 1,000 adults).\n\n\nExpenditure / EGM: Refers to the average Expenditure per Gaming Machine. In 2013, these figures are based on net expenditures divided by number of gaming machines with attached entitlements.\n\n\nSEIFA Scores: a lower score indicates that an area is relatively disadvantaged compared to an area with a higher score. Scores should only be used in distributive analysis. Rankings are based on highest score, for example 1st ranking in index of disadvantage means the LGA is least disadvantaged.\n\n\nDisclaimer: Care must be taken in using any figures for an LGA involving net expenditure and population. The expenditure per person in an LGA may include an amount of expenditure coming from persons not living within the LGA.\n\n",

    "description": "This dataset presents the footprint of the rate of in-hours and after-hours emergency department (ED) presentations per 1,000 people. Both measures have been calculated with the numerator as the total number of eligible presentations and the denominator as the estimated resident population as at 30 June at the beginning of the reporting period. The data spans the financial years 2013-2016 and is aggregated to Statistical Area Level 3 (SA3) geographic areas from the 2011 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nIn-hours ED attendances include attendances where the patient presented to a public hospital ED on weekdays on or after 8am and before 8pm, or Saturdays on or after 8am and before 1pm (excluding public holidays). Attendances were included if the patient was assigned a triage category of 3 (urgent), 4 (semi-urgent) or 5 (non-urgent), was not subsequently admitted to hospital and had an 'emergency presentation' type of visit.\n    After-hours ED attendances include attendances where the patient presented to a public hospital ED on weekdays before 8am or on or after 8pm, Saturdays before 8am or on or after 1pm, or any time on Sundays and public holidays. Attendances were included if the patient was assigned a triage category of 3 (urgent), 4 (semi-urgent) or 5 (non-urgent), was not subsequently admitted to hospital and had an 'emergency presentation' type of visit.\n\n        For further information about this dataset, visit the data source:[Australian Institute of Health and Welfare - Use of emergency department and GP services, 2013-14 to 2015-16 Data Tables](https://www.aihw.gov.au/reports/hospitals/use-emergency-department-gp-services-2015-16/data)\n\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data using the Department of Health - PHN Areas.\n\n\nValues assigned to \"n.p.\" in the original data have been removed from the data.\n\n\nData for SA3s 11002, 20301, 20303, 20505, 30101, 30102, 31901 for 2013-2014, 10902, 11002, 20301, 20303, 20505, 21002, 30101, 30102, 30601, 31901 for 2014-2015, and 10104, 10902, 11002, 20303, 20505, 30101, 30102, 31901 for 2015-2016 should be interpreted with caution, reported data includes 90-95% of public hospital emergency service presentations for residents in these area.\n\n",

    "description": "    \n\nMean annual (00) and monthly (01a|12) transpiration (mm) from the plant canopy\nfor the period 1980-1999.Interpretation:Canopy transpiration is far more\nspatially variable than potential evaporation, reflecting the effects of water\nlimitation in most areas of the continent. Both the annual mean and seasonal\npattern broadly resemble the corresponding patterns for rainfall. Canopy\ntranspiration maps have more acontrasta (relative variation) than the total\nevaporation or rainfall maps because transpiration is a small component of\ntotal evaporation in areas of low plant cover (the remainder being soil\nevaporation).The partitioning between soil evaporation and canopy\ntranspiration in the model is determined by leaf area index.Notes: These are\nmodel-based estimates from the BiosEquil model. Results are given for the\naBASEa (pre-1788) and aAGRICa (present day) conditions.

    "description": "This dataset presents the footprint of the percentage of adults who felt their GP always or often spent enough time in the preceding 12 months. The data spans the years of 2014-2017 and is aggregated to 2015 Department of Health Primary Health Network (PHN) areas, based on the 2011 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nThe data is sourced from the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) 2016-17 Patient Experience Survey, collected between 1 July 2016 and 30 June 2017. It also includes data from previous Patient Experience Surveys conducted in 2013-14, 2014-15 and 2015-16. The Patient Experience Survey is conducted annually by the ABS and collects information from a representative sample of the Australian population. The Patient Experience Survey is one of several components of the Multipurpose Household Survey, as a supplement to the monthly Labour Force Survey. The Patient Experience Survey collects data on persons aged 15 years and over, who are referred to as adults for this data collection.\nFor further information about this dataset, visit the data source:Australian Institute of Health and Welfare - Patient experiences in Australia Data Tables.\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data using the Department of Health - PHN Areas.\n\n\nPercentages are calculated based on counts that have been randomly adjusted by the ABS to avoid the release of confidential data.\n\n\nAs an indication of the accuracy of estimates, 95% confidence intervals were produced. These were calculated by the ABS using standard error estimates of the proportion.\n\n\nSome of the patient experience measures for 2016-17 have age-standardised rates presented. Age-standardised rates are hypothetical rates that would have been observed if the populations studied had the same age distribution as the standard population.\n\n\nCrude rates are provided for all years. They should be used for understanding the patterns of actual service use or level of experience in a particular PHN.\n\n\nThe Patient Experience Survey excludes persons aged less than 15 years, persons living in non-private dwellings and the Indigenous Community Strata (encompassing discrete Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities).\n\n\nData for Northern Territory should be interpreted with caution as the Patient Experience Survey excluded the Indigenous Community Strata, which comprises around 25% of the estimated resident population of the Northern Territory living in private dwellings.\n\n\nRows that contain a \"#\" in \"Interpret with Caution\" indicates that the estimate has a relative standard error of 25% to 50%, which indicates a high level of sampling error relative to its value and must be taken into account when comparing this estimate with other values.\n\n\nNP - Not available for publication. The estimate is considered to be unreliable. Values assigned to NP in the original data have been set to null.\n\n",

Biodiversity values include both species (i.e. flora and fauna) as well as communities. It is intended as an interim dataset and will ultimately be replaced by more comprehensive biodiversity values mapping (in development).

    "description": "Article released in the Australian Journal of Agricultural and Resources Economics January 2018. Cite as: Sheng, Y, Jackson, T and Lawson, K ,2018, Evaluating the benefits from transport infrastructure in agriculture: a hedonic analysis of farmland prices. Australian Journal of Agricultural and Resource Economics. doi:10.1111/1467-8489.12243 \r\n\r\n Access to transport infrastructure generates a range of benefits to the agriculture sector; many of which are difficult to measure directly. In this study, we use hedonic regression analysis of farm-level data to examine the contribution of transport infrastructure to the value of farmland traded between 2009 and 2011 through its impact on farm productivity. \r\n\r\n We show that a one per cent of reduction in the cost of transportation between farms and ports leads to a 0.33 per cent increase in land prices, and there is no significant difference between rail and road transportation at the aggregate level. Moreover, the benefits generated by particular types of infrastructure services vary between industries and with farm size, suggesting there are multiple channels through which public infrastructure influences agricultural production. Our findings help to inform future investment decisions in Australia and in other countries by providing new evidence regarding the benefits of existing transport infrastructure. ",

    "description": "Natural or native molecular hydrogen (H2) can be a major component in natural gas, and yet its role in the global energy sector’s usage as a clean energy carrier is not normally considered. Here, we update the scarce reporting of hydrogen in Australian natural gas with new compositional and isotopic analyses of H2 undertaken at Geoscience Australia. The dataset involves ~1000 natural gas samples from 470 wells in both sedimentary and non-sedimentary basins with reservoir rock age ranging from the Neoarchean to Cenozoic. Pathways to H2 formation can involve either organic matter intermediates and its association with biogenic natural gas or chemical synthesis and its presence in abiogenic natural gas. The latter reaction pathway generally leads to H2-rich (&gt;10 mol% H2) gas in non-sedimentary rocks. Abiogenic H2 petroleum systems are described within concepts of source-migration-reservoir-seal but exploration approaches are different to biogenic natural gas. Rates of abiogenic H2 generation are governed by the availability of specific rock types and different mineral catalysts, and through chemical reactions and radiolysis of accessible water. Hydrogen can be differently trapped compared to hydrocarbon gases; for example, pore space can be created in fractured basement during abiogenic reactions, and clay minerals and evaporites can act as effective adsorbents, traps and seals. Underground storage of H2 within evaporites (specifically halite) and in depleted petroleum reservoirs will also have a role to play in the commercial exploitation of H2. Estimated H2 production rates from water radiolysis in mafic-ultramafic and granitic rocks and serpentinisation of ultramafic-mafic rocks gives a H2 inferred resource potential between ~1.6 to ~58 MMmH3y-1 for onshore Australia down to a depth of 1 km. The prediction and subsequent identification of subsurface H2 that can be exploited remains enigmatic and awaits robust exploration guidelines and targeted drilling for proof of concept.\n\nAppeared in The APPEA Journal 61(1) 163-191, 2 July 2021",

    "description": "This study assesses the effects of  trampling on Hormosira banksii dominated rocky intertidal algal beds within Point Nepean National Park over six summers between 1991 and 1996. This dataset gives the number of mobile animals (N per m2) within beds of Hormosira banksii after exposure to four levels of  experimental trampling for 3 and 5 years.  Sites were located at Cheviot Beach (Harry's pool, Cheviot Mid) or at Grenade Range, ~ 1 km apart.  The number of mobile animals were sampled in the Autumn of 1993 and 1995, after 3 and 5 years of summer trampling,  respectively. Trampling increased the abundance of a number of herbivorous molluscs, particularly limpet abundance. The effect of trampling on the abundance of mollusks may be indirect as changes in the abundance of mollusks occurred only after changes in the cover of Hormosira.",

    "description": "This project focuses on improving methods to detect the introduction of exotic animal diseases into the Torres Strait. The researchers will examine the environmental factors that influence the establishment and persistence of wildlife diseases in the region. They will study insect disease vectors and the incidence of disease in birds in a range of habitats in order to identify where disease risk is greatest. Field studies will be conducted using replicated mosquito trapping and mist netting of birds in Torres Strait, at sites identified from previous projects.  \nOutcomes include:\n\n1. Developing a model of disease dynamics across the Torres Strait based on past and ongoing epidemiology and ecological studies on vectors, reservoir hosts and known disease prevalence including the influence of inter-island and PNG traffic on insect vectors.\n\n2. Undertake a fieldwork program that tests and improves upon our understanding (the model) of how diseases are maintained and dispersed across the islands.\n\n3. Use the results to identify appropriate responses for minimizing the risks associated with disease incursion.\n\n4. Develop capacity in north Queensland in the identification and sampling of vectors and diseases",

    "description": "\n## **Abstract** \nGroundwater sample were obtained from the Cooper Basin, Eromanga Basin and Lake Eyre Basin as part of Stage 3 of the Cooper GBA project. The Eromanga Basin is a part of the Great Artesian Basin. Evans et al. (2020) and Holland et al. (2020) provide detail on hydrogeology of the Cooper GBA region.  In total 39 samples were collected from a range of hydrogeological settings in two field campaigns. One field campaign focussed on obtaining groundwater samples from bores drawing groundwater from Eromanga Basin and overlying Lake Eyre Basin (LBWCo (2020), Dataset 1). Reservoir water samples were collected by petroleum companies on behalf of the GBA program (Dataset 2). Where possible the samples were clustered to provide hydrochemical information at various depths. The locations of Bore that were sampled are outlined in Figure 3.  The sample dataset (Dataset 3, and Dataset 4) is comprised of: – Sixteen from shallow sub-artesian aquifers either the Winton Formation or the Cenozoic Lake Eyre Basin (bores less than 100 m deep). – Thirteen deep GAB bores (sample depths from 1100 to 2070 m). – Ten samples from petroleum wells producing from deep hydrocarbon reservoirs in the Cooper and Eromanga basins.  Hydrochemical analyses include: field parameters, major and minor ions, hydrocarbons, as well as environmental groundwater tracers. Environmental groundwater tracers include; Strontium isotopes, noble gases including 4He, stable isotopes of water, stable isotopes of hydrogen and carbon from methane, chlorofluorocarbons (CFC’s), as well as radioactive tracers - tritium (3H),  Carbon 14 (14C) and Chloride 36 (36Cl).  Further infromation can be found in factsheet 10 available from https://www.bioregionalassessments.gov.au/gba.\n\n\n## **Attribution** \nGeological and Bioregional Assessment Program\n\n\n## **History** \nSampling of aquifers in Eromanga Basin (GAB) and Lake Eyre Basin (Cenozoic) was undertaken by a contractor (LBWCO Pty Ltd) in October 2020. CSIRO sampled 6 GAB bores in November 2019. Samples from production wells were collected by companies on behalf of GBA.  Locations were determined using GPS at time of sampling.",

    "description": "Regional land supply assessments measure the stocks of land for future residential, industrial and commercial uses. It provides context for the land use planning and infrastructure provision required to meet demand across selected regional centres in Western Australia. Regional land supply assessments are prepared by the Department of Planning, Lands and Heritage (the Department) on behalf of the Western Australian Planning Commission (WAPC) to fulfil the requirements for tracking and monitoring land supply, as outlined in section 14 of the Planning and Development Act 2005. The role of WAPC include monitoring and forecasting land supply throughout Western Australia, developing strategies for the timely supply of affordable residential land, and researching and developing planning methods and models relating to land use planning, land development and associated matters. \n\nRegional land supply assessments are one of a suite of products produced as part of the Urban Development Program (UDP). The UDP monitors land supply and promotes the timely delivery of residential, industrial and commercial land in Western Australia. The information presented in regional land supply assessments assist State Government agencies, utility and essential service providers, local governments and the private sector in decision making and forward planning. \n\nRegional land supply assessments include key information on:\n•   demand drivers specific to each regional centre, including the major economic factors that influence employment and population growth, and therefore, the demand for land and housing\n•   zoned land supply for residential (including rural living), industrial and commercial uses\n•   development constraints\n•   recent and future land development activity\n•   existing and required physical infrastructure. \n\nThis spatial dataset shows sites/areas that have been identified for future residential, industrial or commercial development. Sites are included where intent has been demonstrated by Government or the development industry to develop the site at some point in the future. Sites are included based on the current, applicable planning framework at the time of capture/analysis. ",

    "title": "Mobility Australia - Queensland Weekly Ferry Origin-Destination Flow (SA2) 2019",
    "description": "This dataset estimates human mobility through origin destination (OD) movement flow among the Statistical Area 2 (SA2) regions in Queensland (QLD), connected by public transport (PT) networks. The SA2 regions of Queensland connected by buses, trains, trams and ferries have been used to evaluate OD movement flows. The passenger OD movement data among different stations (or the station-based OD flow) are first estimated using a statistical estimation methodology. The stations-based OD flow data are then translated into region-based OD matrices using the state-of-art method. For more information please see the original metadata file here.\nHuman mobility data is a key ingredient in various areas and domains of research including epidemiology, policy and administration, criminology, transportation, logistics and supply chains, environmental management and, pollution and contamination. High quality human mobility data provided by telecommunication companies collected from call data records (CDRs) is available at prohibitive cost with restrictive licensing, keeping it out of reach for the majority of research community. On the other hand, there is an abundance of high-quality public data, reporting different aspects of mobility. Examples are the public transport patronage and information about the usage of the Australian road network. These datasets are collected by different organisations and government departments and are presented in various formats. For instance, data may be collected at different spatial (e.g. at state or postcode levels) and temporal scales and be presented in the form of passenger counts or aggregated movement flows. This dataset addresses the general lack of national scale comprehensive human mobility dataset in Australia by transforming available mobility data into a consistent format that is suitable for analysis in a broad range of research areas. Merging the various individual datasets into Australia's first comprehensive, national-scale human mobility data asset drastically improves the quality and coverage of existing datasets.\nThe Mobility Australia project received investment (https://doi.org/10.47486/DP702) from the Australian Research Data Commons (ARDC). The ARDC is funded by the National Collaborative Research Infrastructure Strategy (NCRIS).\nThe original data tables were structured in a matrix-like format. AURIN employed a methodology to merge diverse datasets into a comprehensive one, categorising based on transportation types (e.g., trains, buses, rails, ferries), years (e.g., 2019, 2020, 2021, etc.), and temporal scales (e.g., weekly, monthly, yearly). Subsequently, AURIN spatially enabled the original data by employing the 2021 edition of the Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS). The flow between origin and destination pairs is visually represented using line geometry.",

    "title": "The Flowery Gully limestones deposits, Tasmania",
    "description": "The Flowery Gully Limestone Deposit, twenty miles north of Launceston, was surveyed in detail to delineate the most suitable portions for supplying limestone to the Australian Aluminium Production Commission's plant at Bell Bay, five miles to the north east across the Tamar Estuary. Basic requirements for the limestone were that it lie in an area suitable for quarrying and have as low a silica and magnesium carbonate content as possible so that it could be used efficiently in the aluminium extraction process. The preliminary reconnaissance revealed a stratigraphical chemical control and it was found possible to divide the section measuring 1,700 feet in true thickness into three stratigraphical zones, the topmost of which contains the purest limestone and is most suitable for Bell Bay; the middle zone contains isolated areas of high quality stone. The more detailed survey to reveal quarryable stone in these two zones defined one major and one minor deposit in the upper zone and one minor deposit in the middle. These three deposits contain indicated and inferred reserves totalling 1,000,000 tons; of this figure 100,000 tons has an average grade of 0.4% silica and 5.7% magnesium carbonate and the remainder has a grade not exceeding 0.5% silica and 4% magnesium carbonate. The investigation of the depositional environment revealed quiet and consistent conditions of deposition, which information was used to indicate possible areas for exploration for additional reserves when necessary. Numerous bedded chert nodules are present in the high-silica-content areas of the middle zone. The origin of the silica of this zone was investigated chemically and petrologically, but the results were inconclusive. It was discovered however that practically all silica was syngenetic. It is now mainly in the form of quartz grains and in smaller amounts as a component of the small percentage of clay present; however where chert nodules are present the silica of the cherts is in the form of chalcedony. Areas of marked dolomitization were noted, particularly in the upper and middle zones; they probably represent algal reefs (stromatoporoid bioherms). One of them had a lateral extent of at least 1,600 feet. A distinct disconformity was revealed by the detailed mapping at the top of the limestone section.",

    "description": "The policy applies to land in the vicinity of Jandakot airport, which is, or may in the future, be affected by aircraft noise. \n\nOpened in 1963, Jandakot Airport is the principal general aviation airport in Western Australia, and is one of the busiest airfields and largest aviation training bases in Australia. It is an important element of transport infrastructure, servicing both the region and the State as a whole and makes a significant contribution to the economy of the local area.\n\nIt is important however to recognise the physical context in which the airport is situated, and to minimise as far as practicable, adverse impacts on adjacent development such as aircraft noise, which is the focus of this Policy. The objectives of this policy are to:\n<ul>\n<li>\n\nprotect Jandakot Airport from encroachment by incompatible land use and development, so as to provide for its ongoing, safe, and efficient operation; and \n</li>\n<li>\n\nminimize the impact of airport operations on existing and future communities with particular reference to aircraft noise.\n</li>\n</ul>",
