The percentage of CaCO3 in samples collected from different depths were analysed, along with other parameters, to determine changes in carbonate mineralogy and terrestrial influx. Levels of CaCO3% exhibit an higher percentage of >60% during the middle of Marine Isotope Stage (MIS) 3, levels similar to those seen in MIS 1. Throughout MIS 2 and during the glacial termination the CaCO3% remains relatively constant at ~60%. CaCO3 drops to 50% prior to a possible Antarctic cold reversal (between 14 ka BP and 12 ka BP) at 80cm in the core, before recovering to the 65-70% in the Holocene again.",

    "title": "FPM Historical Flood Levels (m AHD) (DWER-122)",
    "description": "Historically, low-lying land adjacent to rivers and coastlines has been favoured for settlement as they provided sources of fresh water, food, transportation and waste disposal. These areas become affected by flooding during sufficiently heavy or prolonged rainfall, high tides or storm surges and cyclones. In the north-west of the State flooding is most likely to be caused by the summer monsoon or tropical cyclones while floods in the south-west are more likely to occur in response to heavy winter rainfalls.\n\nWhile historical flood records and information extend as far back as 1830, detailed information on peak flood levels is typically limited to the last few decades.\n\nThis dataset contains the available surveyed peak flood level information for major flood events that have occurred in Western Australia. The flood levels are referenced to the Australian Height Datum (AHD).\n\nNote: To see the full scope of the historical flood mapping, 3 dataset layers are required to be loaded in the following order:\n\nFLOODPLAIN DATASET LAYERS:    \nFPM Historical Flood Levels (m AHD)\nFPM Historical Extent of Flooding\nFPM Historical Floodplain Area\n\nMajor flood events that have occurred in the past include:\n\nBlackwood River (1945, 1955, 1963, 1964, 1982)\nCollie River (1945, 1963, 1964, 1974, 1982)\nFitzroy River (1983, 1986, 1991, 1993, 2002, 2011)\nGascoyne River (1960, 1961, 1980, 1995, 2000, 2010)\nGreenough River (1888, 1927, 1953, 1971, 1988, 1999, 2006)\nMoore River (1934, 1955, 1961, 1995, 1999)\nMurray River (1862, 1945, 1955, 1964)\nPreston River (1964, 1967, 1974, 1983, 1990, 2011)\nSwan River (1862, 1872, 1945, 1955, 1964, 1983)\n\nThe historical flood information is used in the Department of Water and Environmental Regulation's floodplain management activities to ensure that floodplains are managed for the benefit of the whole community, minimising the risk and damages and protecting environmental values.\n\nFloodplain mapping datasets and floodplain development strategies for rivers and major watercourses in Western Australia are also available from the Department of Water and Environmental Regulation.\n\nNote: The ‘Event’ dates in the attribute table are derived from various sources, including Department of Water and Environmental Regulation's Floodplain Management Section reports, records and plans, historical newspaper articles, flood survey information, Bureau of Meteorology rainfall intensity records, on-site flood information and information provided by locals. It is not always possible to obtain an exact date when the flood event has occurred because in some cases the floodwaters may take several days to subside, peaking at different times at various locations over the course, or historical records may only refer to the month or year of the event.\n\nHowever, considering the above date variations the ‘Event’ dates are listed as follows:   \n\n22nd December 2010: The day, month and year of the flood event (or rainfall) are known.\n\nAugust 1963: The month and year are known. Exact date unknown.\n\n1954: The year is known but the month and day are unknown.\n\nGlossary:\n<ul>\n<li>\n\nAnnual exceedance probability (AEP) - the likelihood of occurrence of a flood of a given size or larger in any one year; usually expressed as a percentage.\n</li>\n<li>\n\n1 in 100 AEP flood - this means that there is a 1 in 100 (or 1%) chance of a flow of this size or larger occurring in any one year. This flood has a 50% chance of being experienced at least once in a person's lifetime. The 1 in 100 AEP flood has been generally adopted in Australia and overseas as the basis for floodplain management planning.\n</li>\n<li>\n\nFloodplain - the portion of a river valley next to the river channel which is covered with water when the river overflows its banks during major river flows. The term also applies to land adjacent to estuaries which is subject to flooding.\n</li>\n<li>\n\nAustralian Height Datum (AHD) - is a geodetic datum for altitude measurement in Australia. It was adopted in 1971 by the National Mapping Council as the datum to which all vertical control for mapping is to be referred. The datum is based on the mean sea level (1966-1968) being assigned the value 0.000m on the Australian Height Datum (AHD) at 30 tide gauges around the coast of the Australian continent.\n</li>\n</ul>",

    "description": "This dataset presents the footprint of statistics of potentially preventable hospitalisations (PPH). PPH does not mean that a patient admitted for that condition did not need to be hospitalised at the time of admission. Rather the hospitalisation could have potentially been prevented through the provision of appropriate preventative health interventions and early disease management in primary care and community-based care settings. PPH rates are indicators of the effectiveness of non-hospital care. The data spans the financial years of 2013-2017 and is aggregated to Statistical Area Level 3 (SA3) geographic areas from the 2016 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nThe data is sourced from the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare (AIHW) - National Hospital Morbidity Database (NHMD), which is a compilation of episode-level records from admitted patient morbidity data collection systems in Australian public and private hospitals.\nFor further information about this dataset visit the data source:Australian Institute of Health and Welfare - Potentially Preventable Hospitalisations Data Tables.\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data.\n\n\nIn tables presenting measures by PPH condition, some hospitalisations may account for multiple PPH conditions. As a result, conditions may not sum to categories, and categories may not sum to Total PPH.\n\n\nThe counting unit for this publication were episodes of stay, measured by financial year of separation. This may be a complete hospital stay (to discharge, transfer, or death), or a part of the stay if there was a change of care type (for example from acute to rehabilitation). As a record is included for each hospitalisation, not for each patient, patients hospitalised more than once or transferred between hospitals in the financial year will have more than one record.\n\n\nEpisodes for unqualified newborn care, posthumous organ procurement or hospital boarders were excluded.\n\n\nPopulation counts are based on estimated resident populations at 30 June for each year. Australian estimated resident population data are sourced from Australian demographic statistics (ABS cat. no. 3101.0).\n\n\nThe definition of SA3 reported varies by financial year. Results for 2016-17 are reported using the 2016 release of SA3 and results for earlier years are reported using the 2011 release of SA3.\n\n\nNational totals include data where the place of usual residence was overseas, no fixed abode, offshore and migratory, and undefined but these data are excluded from PHN and SA3 area estimates.\n\n\nAll data for an area were suppressed (marked NP) if the number of rounded PPH was less than 5. Values assigned NP in the original data have been set to null.\n\n",

The echosounder's nominal frequency range is from 40 to 100 kHz. \nData are stored in .kmall raw format for bathymetry and backscatter and .kmwcd format for watercolumn backscatter at CSIRO. \nThere are 153 files totalling 15.9 GB of raw data and 153 files totalling 65.8 GB of water column data in this dataset. \nSound velocity profiles were applied to this data during data acquisition. Bathymetry data contained in *.kmall format are corrected for motion and position. \nGPS tide was computed using the EGM2008 model and applied to the processed data. Processed data has had outliers removed. \nAdditional information regarding this dataset, including further information on processing streams, is contained in the GSM data acquisition and processing report.",

Consisting of Acoustic Doppler Velocimeters, temperature loggers and an Acoustic Wave and Current Meter (AWAC)\nAn RTK bathymetry survey was also conducted over a number of days during the field program.\nA weather station was also deployed on a scaffold tower in the intertidal area. Weather station measured was used to measure wind speed, air temperature, solar radiation and barometric pressure.\nData associated with this metadata record pertains to 4 Nortek Vectors deployed on the reef and a weather station mounted on in the lagoon.",

P&amp;D Code Variations represent the spatial boundaries that provide additional guidance for development on 'what' can happen in an area.\nThe data is updated fortnightly and can be viewed in the South Australian Property and Planning Atlas (SAPPA).\nNOTE: all the TNVs have been combined into a single dataset and individual TNVs can be viewed by doing a definition query on the name field.",

All other clients not meeting these criteria are considered to be at risk of homelessness (excluding clients who did not provide sufficient information to make this assessment). \n\n\nHousing circumstances are determined based on the client's type of residence, tenure and conditions of occupancy.\n\n\nRates are crude rates based on the Australian estimated resident population at 30 June of the reference year, as detailed in the online technical information.\n\n\nIncludes clients from 'Other territories' and those that have not provided location information.\n\n\nData presented have not been adjusted for partial or non-response (unweighted).\n\n\nClients are assigned to a region based on where they lived in the week before presenting to a SHS agency. Clients are assigned to only one region, based on the location details provided in the first support period in the reference year. Regions are defined by the 2016 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data and has excluded data from 'Unknown' SA4s.",

The data is aggregated to Postal Areas (POAs) from the 2016 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nEvery month the Clean Energy Regulator (CER) publishes small-scale renewable energy installation data files. These data files provide a list of small generation units (SGU) (small-scale solar panel, wind and hydro systems) and kW capacity by installed postcode, and SWH and air source heat pumps by installed postcode. The data represents all systems that have had certificates validly created against them. The data includes new installations, upgrades to existing systems and stand-alone (off-grid) systems. This data is not publicly available via the Renewable Energy Certificate (REC) Registry and does not include systems that are pending registration or have been failed by the CER.\nFor further information about this dataset, visit the data source:Clean Energy Regulator - Postcode Data for Small-scale Installations.\nPlease note:\n\n\nA 12 month creation period for registered persons to create small-scale technology certificates applies under the Renewable Energy (Electricity) Act 2000.\n\n\nSmall-scale technology certificates are calculated based on the life of the system. This differs for solar hot water heaters and small generation units (solar panels, wind and hydro). \n\n\nThis data is current as at 28-02-2021.\n\n\nFurther information can be found at theRenewable Energy Target FAQ.\n\n\nAir source heat pumps were introduced into the Small-scale Renewable Energy Scheme in 2005 as such there is no installation data available pre-2005 for this fuel source.\n AURIN has made the following change to the original data:\n\n\nSpatially enabled the original data by joining the data with the 2016 ASGS POAs\n\n",

In hand specimen the rock is dark brownish grey in colour and is dense and tough.  Fragments of wood and of a pelecypod shell are present. A micro-palaeontological examination of the rock yielded interesting information as to the age of the beds the well penetrated at this depth. This section of the rock and of the fragment of wood were cut, and portion of the rock was crushed in the hope of finding micro-fossils.",

Researchers at the Australian National University (ANU) developed CLAM in 2004 when contracted by the NSW State Government to provide sustainability assessments of 8 coastal lakes. Several projects have since been established directly with local government and NRM groups.\n\nTo date, 27 CLAMs have been developed in New South Wales, where they generally fit within estuary management or catchment management plans. To develop these CLAMs and build local capacity to maintain them, ANU-Enterprise Pty Ltd - the commercial company of ANU developed an Accreditation Scheme whereby local consultants are trained in the CLAM approach.",

    "description": "\n## **Abstract** \nThis annual time series dataset was compiled by the Geological and Bioregional Assessment Program from source data referenced within the dataset and/or metadata. The dataset represents the estimated proportion of species occurring in each location expected to persist in the long-term based on spatial patterns in habitat condition. This product was derived by combining the habitat condition annual time series with a spatial projection of a generalized dissimilarity model of plant community compositional turnover across Australia. The grid for each year can be combined with the summed similarity of each location to all other locations (also provided) to derive an estimate for the Cooper GBA region or any sub-region within it, of the total proportion of species in that region expected to persist in the long-term, given changes in habitat condition.\n\n\n## **Attribution** \nGeological and Bioregional Assessment Program\n\n\n## **History** \nTo assess the impacts of changes in habitat condition on plant biodiversity in the Cooper GBA region, we applied the habitat based methodology developed by Ferrier et al. (2004) that has subsequently been used in a variety of biodiversity assessments (Allnutt et al. 2008; UNEP-WCMC 2016). This approach uses the predicted spatial patterns in compositional dissimilarity between site-pairs to estimate the total proportion of biodiversity retained over a region at each time point (P).\r\n\r\nSpecifically, for each and every ≈250 m grid cell i across the focal region, we estimate the proportion (pi) of species historically occurring in this cell that are likely to be retained within remaining habitat anywhere in their range. For the present analysis, we used an existing continental model of plant community compositional dissimilarity at 250 m resolution (Mokany et al. 2018), while the derivation of spatial layers of habitat condition is described in the data entry: Cooper_habitat_condition_time_series.\r\n\r\nThe overall proportion of species (P) retained across the focal region can then be estimated as a weighted average of the pi values for all n individual grid cells, to incorporate the effects of compositional overlap between grid cells, using the summed similarity (Σsij) of all other grid cells to each focal cell i. \r\n\r\nWe applied this approach to estimate the proportion of the original plant diversity retained across the Cooper GBA region at each time point, being 1 year intervals past-to-present (2001-2018). For this analysis, we assessed biodiversity persistence across all locations within the assessment regions, incorporating information on habitat condition and community compositional similarity from a broader area, being the assessment region plus a 50 km buffer. This approach incorporates the effects of habitat condition and biodiversity patterns beyond the study regions in calculating expected biodiversity persistence within the regions, given that many of the species occurring within the regions are likely to have much broader spatial distributions. The biodiversity analyses were undertaken using CSIRO’s bilbi61 package in Python (Ware 2020).\r\n\r\nREFERENCES\r\nAllnutt, T.F., Ferrier, S., Manion, G., Powell, G.V.N., Ricketts, T.H., Fisher, B.L. et al.

    "description": "This table: NVIS5_1_LUT_AUST_FLAT is a lookup table containing NVIS Version 5.1 vegetation descriptions in a simpler, deconstructed table, allowing for improved analyses and use of the NVIS detailed vegetation descriptions. The table contains a total of 10,774 NVIS vegetation types.\n\nFor complex analyses and to extract maximum information from NVIS spatial data, this LUT can also be linked to NVISDSC1-6. \n\nThis LUT is a deconstruction of the Level 5 string within the NVIS detailed data (for NVIS Level 1-6 strings use NVIS5_1_LUT_AUST_DETAIL) where provided by the state/territory (not all veg descriptions have Level 5 & 6). \n\nIt is recommended that users refer to the Australian Vegetation Atrribute Manual V7.0 for understanding of the NVIS hierarchy (Level 1-6 descriptions) and structural information - \nhttp://www.environment.gov.au/node/18927. \n\nA legend or 'shadeset' for the MVGs and MVSs can be found packaged with the detailed vector data: \nNVIS5_1_AUST_EXT_ and NVIS5_1_AUST_PRE_.\n\nThis table joins to the NVIS 5.1 spatial data for all states and territories (NVIS_ID in this table to NVISDSC1 in NVIS5_1_EXT_ and NVIS5_1_PRE_ ). For complex analyses and to extract maximum information from NVIS spatial data, this LUT can also be linked to NVISDSC2-6. \n\nOnce this table has been joined, a simple display option is to use the field \"NVIS5_1_LUT_AUST_FLAT.MVG_NAME\" (or MVS_NAME if preferred) which includes the names of the NVIS Major Vegetation Groups (MVGs) [most of] which are described at: http://www.environment.gov.au/land/publications/factsheets-vegetation-profiles-major-vegetation-groups. \n\nUse the field \"MVG_NUMBER\" or \"MVS_NUMBER\" for the symbology.CC - Attribution (CC BY)\nThis data has been licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International Licence.

Also, Levels 5 and 6 are sometimes incomplete for a given region - i.e. spatial and/or attribute \"gaps\" exist in the data. \n\nTo avoid these problems and ensure the data can be used for continental and regional analyses, the MVG and MVS classifications and products were developed with additional manual interpretation and additional non-NVIS data interpreted direct to MVG/MVS.\n\nThis version was based on new NVIS data from Tasmania and further gapfill work completed for NSW. Collection scale, more-detailed vegetation floristic and structural data and/or more-consistent interpretations have been improved for many parts of Australia. Therefore, it would not be valid to compare this version quantitatively with earlier version(s) of NVIS.\n\nNon-vegetation and non-native vegetation major vegetation classes are not to be used in quantitative analyses.\n© Commonwealth of Australia (Department of the Environment and Energy) 2018.",

After accounting for unemployed people and those whose jobs cannot be done remotely—for example, dentists, cashiers and cleaners—the sample represents around 59 per cent of NSW workers. \nWorkers answered questions on: \n• their attitudes to remote working \n• the amount of time they spent working remotely \n• their employers’ policies, practices, and attitudes \n• how they spent their time when working remotely \n• how barriers to remote working have changed \n• the barriers they faced to hybrid working \n• their expectations for future remote working",

The data shows the number of business establishments per city (CLUE) block, classified by their ANZSIC1 industry and small area allocation. The data is aggregated to the 2016 Blocks for CLUE Boundaries and covers the year period of 2009.\nA business establishment is defined as a \n\n\nCommercial occupant in a building\n\n\nSeparate land use\n\n\nAny permanent presence of economic activity in accordance with standard Industry classification (ANZSIC).\n\n\nHence, if one organisation has its presence in several buildings in the CLUE area, each time it will be counted as a separate establishment. Consequently, the count of establishments presented in CLUE represents the number of locations, rather than 'enterprises'.\nFor more information please visit the City of Melbourne CLUE Portal and ABS ANZSIC Page.\nPlease note: \n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the data acquired through the City of Melbourne Open Data Portal.\n\n\nThe individual yearly tables have been extracted from the archived 2002-2017 tables.\n\n\nThe data in this table is a snapshot and not live.\n\n",

Individuals of both species were collected from Workshops Jetty and Altona Pier prior to the experiment and transported back to the laboratory. Two colonies of either B. neritina or B. dentata were attached to each plate using sponges that expanded when wet. The plates were then transported to Workshops Jetty and attached to plates and left for 12 days. At the conclusion of the experiment plates were collected and abundances of species on the plates were counted and identified.",

It was first deployed in April 2011.\n\nThe mooring's instruments measure surface CO2, temperature and salinity.  The hydrochemistry sampling at the National Reference Stations will also provide total alkalinity data, as will future pH sensors on the moorings, allowing for a complete determination of the carbonate system and pH. Current instrumentation: Battele Seaology pCO2 monitor, Aanderaa Oxygen Optode and Sea-bird Electronics, model SBE16plus V2 SEACAT.\n\nThe Acidification Moorings sub-facility is responsible for building an ocean carbon and acidification monitoring network for Australian waters.  These moorings provide key observations to help us understand and address the problem of increasing ocean acidification.",

    "description": "The Coastal Lake Assessment and Management (CLAM) tool allows stakeholders to assess the social, economic and environmental trade-offs associated with development, remediation and use options for coastal lakes and estuaries. Researchers at the Australian National University (ANU) developed CLAM in 2004 when contracted by the NSW State Government to provide sustainability assessments of 8 coastal lakes. Several projects have since been established directly with local government and NRM groups.\n\nTo date, 27 CLAMs have been developed in New South Wales, where they generally fit within estuary management or catchment management plans. To develop these CLAMs and build local capacity to maintain them, ANU-Enterprise Pty Ltd - the commercial company of ANU developed an Accreditation Scheme whereby local consultants are trained in the CLAM approach.",

This was delayed from the usual May to June timeframe due to the impact of COVID-19. \r\n\r\nThe Employee Census provides a comprehensive view of the APS and ensures no eligible respondents are omitted from the survey sample, removing sampling bias and reducing sample error. The Census' content is designed to establish the views of APS employees on workplace issues such as leadership, learning and development, and job satisfaction.\r\n\r\nOverall, 108,085 APS employees responded to the Employee Census in 2020, a response rate of 78%.\r\n\r\nPlease be aware that the very large number of respondents to the employee census means these files are over 200MB in size. Downloading and opening these files may take some time.\r\n\r\n\r\nTECHNICAL NOTES\r\n\r\nThree files are available for download.\r\n\r\n* 2020 APS Employee Census - Questionnaire: This contains the 2020 APS Employee Census questionnaire.\r\n\r\n* 2020 APS Employee Census - 5 point dataset.csv: This file contains individual responses to the 2020 APS Employee Census as clean, tabular data as required by data.gov.au. This will need to be used in conjunction with the above document.\r\n\r\n* 2020 APS Employee Census - 5 point dataset.sav: This file contains individual responses to the 2020 APS Employee Census for use with the SPSS software package.\r\n\r\nTo protect the privacy and confidentiality of respondents to the 2020 APS Employee Census, the datasets provided on data.gov.au include responses to a limited number of demographic or other attribute questions.\r\n\r\nFull citation of this dataset should list the Australian Public Service Commission (APSC) as the author.  A recommended short citation is: 2020 APS Employee Census data, Australian Public Service Commission. \r\n\r\nAny queries can be directed to research@apsc.gov.au.",

    "description": "    \n\nMean annual (00) and monthly (01a|12) transpiration (mm) from the plant canopy\nfor the period 1980-1999.Interpretation:Canopy transpiration is far more\nspatially variable than potential evaporation, reflecting the effects of water\nlimitation in most areas of the continent. Both the annual mean and seasonal\npattern broadly resemble the corresponding patterns for rainfall. Canopy\ntranspiration maps have more acontrasta (relative variation) than the total\nevaporation or rainfall maps because transpiration is a small component of\ntotal evaporation in areas of low plant cover (the remainder being soil\nevaporation).The partitioning between soil evaporation and canopy\ntranspiration in the model is determined by leaf area index.Notes: These are\nmodel-based estimates from the BiosEquil model. Results are given for the\naBASEa (pre-1788) and aAGRICa (present day) conditions. The aAGRICa case\nincludes current agricultural inputs of water from\nirrigation.EvapCanopy.00.Agric, EvapCanopy.01.Agric a| EvapCanopy.12.Agric a\nMean annual and monthly canopy transpiration (mm) in the aAGRICa (present day)\nscenarioEvapCanopy.00.Base, EvapCanopy.01.Base a| EvapCanopy.12.Base a Mean\nannual and monthly canopy transpiration (mm) in the aBASEa (pre-1788)\nscenarioData is in geographics and GDA94.\n\nSee [further metadata](http://data.daff.gov.au/anrdl/metadata_files/pa_ctab_r9cl\n__01411a24.xml) for more detail.\n\n",

    "description": "This release consists of flux tower measurements of the exchange of energy and mass between the surface and the atmospheric boundary-layer using eddy covariance techniques. Data were processed using PyFluxPro (v3.4.7) as described by Isaac et al. (2017). PyFluxPro produces a final, gap-filled product with Net Ecosystem Exchange (NEE) partitioned into Gross Primary Productivity (GPP) and Ecosystem Respiration (ER).\n\nThe Loxton site was established in August 2008 and decommissioned in June 2009. The orchard was divided into 10&nbsp;ha blocks (200&nbsp;m by 500&nbsp;m with the long axis aligned north–south) and the flux tower was situated at 34.47035&nbsp;°S and 140.65512&nbsp;°E near the middle of the northern half of a block of trees. The topography of the site was slightly undulating and the area around the tower had a slope of less than 1.5&nbsp;°. The orchard was planted in 2000 with an inter-row spacing of 7&nbsp;m and a within row spacing of 5&nbsp;m. Tree height in August 2008 was 5.5&nbsp;m. The study block consists of producers, Nonpareil, planted every other row, and pollinators planted as alternating rows of Carmel, Carmel and Peerless, and Carmel and Price. All varieties were planted on Nemaguard rootstock. All but 31&nbsp;ha of the surrounding orchard was planted between 1999 and 2002. Nutrients were applied via fertigation. Dosing occurred between September and November and in April with KNO3, Urea, KCl, and NH4NO3 applied at annual rates of 551, 484, 647, and 113&nbsp;kg/ha, respectively. The growth of ground cover along the tree line was suppressed with herbicides throughout the year. Growth in the mid-row began in late winter and persisted until herbicide application in late November.\nThe research was supported with funds from the National Action Plan for Salinity via the Centre for Natural Resource Management, and the River Murray Levy.",

    "description": "The tidal flats of the Kimberley coast support the largest populations of migratory shorebirds in Australia. Eighty Mile Beach and Roebuck Bay are the most important shorebird sites in the region, regularly supporting more than 550,000 migratory shorebirds.\nShorebird numbers in north-western Australia have been monitored systematically since 2004, with the long-term objective of developing a dataset that can assess changes in shorebird diversity and numbers over time, and their response to environmental changes, such as local changes in coastal morphology, habitat loss (including that in staging areas), global population decline, climate change and sea-level rise. We seek to extend this monitoring program through the summer of 2012/2013.  WAMSI funding was used to carry out two summer shorebird counts, 24-30 Nov 2012 and 9-14 Dec 2012, maintaining the continuity of a 14-year series of systematic counts from Eighty Mile Beach, Roebuck Bay and Bush Point. \nThe data obtained will be added to the existing database, and used in two analyses/publications: \n(1) An assessment of whether dramatic declines in shorebird abundance in Korea following large-scale reclamation operations resulted in detectable effects in abundance and survival of shorebirds in northwestern Australia; \n(2) An assessment of whether shorebirds have changed their pattern of high tide roost use since 2004.",

    "description": "A gravity core (GC11) was collected from a depth of 502 mbsl within the Capricorn Channel, southern Great Barrier Reef (GBR). Isotopic values for 18O and 13C were obtained from Gs. ruber and correlated with the SPECMAP age-model. The results highlight 4 glacial cycles, incorporating Marine Isotope Stage (MIS) 1 through to MIS 11. Isotopically heavier 18O values at ~460cm, ~345cm, 150cm, and 30cm correspond respectively to MIS 10 (359 kyr BP), MIS 8 (260 kyr BP), MIS 6 (140 kyr BP) and the LGM (20 kyr BP). Sedimentation rates are typically low, <1 cm/kyr to ~4 cm/kyr. The higher sedimentation rates are evident at glacial / interglacial terminations, but then drop off rapidly in the interglacials.",

A high percentage of the mineral grains of the heavy mineral fraction in these sands have grain sizes within the range -100 to +200, referred to British Standard Sieves. The grain size of the minerals, combined with the fact that the grains are quite well rounded, makes the heavy mineral sands an ideal subject for separation using the inclined method with the Isodynamic Separator. The use of this method, and the results obtained, are described in this report.",

    "description": "This project will map the genetic and phylogenetic diversity of northeast Queensland rainforest plants and fungi with a focus on the mountaintop species, which are regarded as among the most at risk from climate warming. The project consists of two nested subprojects. \n\nProject ¿a¿ (PD analysis) will provide a broad scale analysis of patterns of genetic diversity across the NE Qld rainforests. This study will investigate the relative performance of taxonomic richness and phylogenetic diversity measures for conservation priority setting in the Wet Tropics and Cape York rainforest contexts. We will use the results to identify and map areas of high biodiversity significance and investigate correlations with environmental and ecological variables. Preliminary results to date show that areas with higher PD than expected contain a higher proportion of immigrant plant lineages dispersed mostly from Southeast Asia within the past few million years. Our results demonstrate how the integration of historical data and PD can more effectively inform conservation priority setting particularly in biomes with complex evolutionary histories. \n\nProject ¿b¿ (mountain-top diversity) takes a finer scale look at population-level genetic diversity in one highly restricted rainforest ecosystem ¿ mountain-top rainforest ¿ projected to be most threatened by climate change. We will combine emerging genetic technologies with environmental, ecological and morphological information to: 1) elucidate the location and relative importance of high altitude refugia for plants in the Wet Tropics and Cape York Peninsula Bioregions and the mechanisms that influence the survival of populations and species; and 2) document the fungal biodiversity of the mountain tops.",

The footprint is defined as the boundary of the structure where the walls intersect with the ground plane or podium, rather than an outline of the roof area (roofprint).\n\nWhere a building has a significant change in built form, multiple footprint polygons are ‘stacked’ vertically to define shape of the built form. This includes, and is not limited to:\n\n- Tower\n- Podium\n- Setbacks/offsets\n\nThe Australian Height Datum (AHD) is the national vertical datum for Australia.

    "description": "The Australian Government’s Exploring for the Future Musgrave Palaeovalley Project investigated the groundwater systems of the Western Musgrave region. This arid desert area spans the borders of Western Australia, Northern Territory, and South Australia, and contains no perennial surface water features. Consequently, remote communities, the environment, and industry in the area depend solely on groundwater.\n\nTo enhance the understanding of palaeovalley geology and groundwater systems, 19,400 line kilometres of airborne electromagnetics (AEM) were acquired, and 18 bores were sampled for hydrochemical data, including isotopes and environmental tracers. These new data were integrated with legacy AEM data from historical mineral exploration and a regional bore database of approximately 200 bores.\n\nUtilising these datasets, we developed a three-dimensional model of palaeovalleys and Cenozoic systems, producing the region’s first hydrogeological conceptual model. Palaeovalleys in the study area generally slope gently southward, with sufficient thickness to contain significant amounts of groundwater. We also identified several areas where neo-tectonic faulting disrupts palaeovalley flow paths, likely leading to groundwater compartmentalisation and upwelling.&lt;\n\nCenozoic groundwater in the region was found to be fresh to brackish and well-connected on a regional scale. Isotopic and tracer data indicate that most groundwater is relatively young (&lt;100 years) and recharged by events associated with cyclones and monsoons. We also propose a hypothesis linking high nitrate groundwaters commonly encountered in arid Australia with conditions created by the often-targeted calcrete aquifers.\n\nThe project's findings highlight the crucial role of groundwater in arid environments and demonstrate the importance of integrating geophysical and hydrochemical methods.\n\nPresented at the 52nd Congress of International Association of Hydrogeologists (IAH2025)",

    "description": "AUV Sirius (IMOS Platform code: SIRIUS) was deployed in the Great Barrier Reef in February 2011.\n\nIn the Great Barrier Reef the program is focused on seagrass beds in the middle of the GBR lagoon to understand how their abundance is affected by upwelling coming through the Magnetic and Palm Passages and on deepwater coral reefs on the outer GBR.  Although there is extensive monitoring of shallow water reefs along the extent of the GBR, there has been relatively little opportunity to monitor deeper reefs. Understanding the nature of these deepwater reefs may provide important insights into the resilience of the GBR to stresses such as changing temperatures, ocean acidification, cyclones and nutrient influx from the coast.  Surveys of the seagrass beds in the lagoon, which were designed to revisit sites surveyed using towed video ten years ago, and at Myrmidon Reef on the outer GBR were completed during July 2011 to establish benthic reference sites in this area.",

    "description": "This dataset contains multibeam sonar backscatter data from seabed mapping surveys on the Van Diemen Rise in the eastern Joseph Bonaparte Gulf of the Timor Sea. The survey was conducted under a Memorandum of Understanding between Geoscience Australia (GA) and the Australian Institute of Marine Science (AIMS) in two consecutive years 2009 (GA survey number GA-0322 and AIMS survey number SOL4934) and 2010 (GA survey number GA-0325 and AIMS survey number SOL5117). The surveys obtained detailed geological (sedimentological, geochemical, geophysical) and biological data (macro-benthic and infaunal diversity, community structure) for the banks, channels and plains to investigate relationships between the physical environment and associated biota for biodiversity prediction. The surveys also provide Arafura-Timor Sea, and wider northern Australian marine region context for the benthic biodiversity of the Van Diemen Rise. Four study areas were investigated across the outer to inner shelf. Refer to the GA record 'Methodologies for seabed substrate characterisation using multibeam bathymetry, backscatter, and video data: A case study for the Eastern Joseph Bonaparte Gulf, Northern Australia' for further information on processing techniques applied (GeoCat: 74092; GA Record: 2013/11).\n\nYou can also purchase hard copies of Geoscience Australia data and other products at http://www.ga.gov.au/products-services/how-to-order-products/sales-centre.html",

    "description": "River basin catchment areas for Melbourne.  This layer has two intended purposes: \n\n<ol><li>To provide a readily available amalgamation of MWC_Catchments that make up the river basins within Melbourne Water’s area. </li><li>Useful for larger scale plans and maps.</li></ol>\n\nData for basin boundaries have been captured by relevant State and Territory authorities from 1:10 000 and 1:250 000 scale source material. The balance of the data are from Geoscience Australia's GEODATA Coast 100K which includes coastlines and State and Territory borders. Topographic Drainage Divisions and River Region boundaries are updated based on current research, data and technology. It references previous work of the Australian Water Resources Management Committee as shown in Australia's River Basins 1997. This work is a collaboration of scientists from the Bureau of Meteorology, Australian National University Fenner School of Environment and Society, CSIRO Water for Healthy Country Flagship and Geoscience Australia.\n\n\n\nIn late 2008, the Bureau of Meteorology (BoM), in partnership with Geoscience Australia, CSIRO and the Australian National University (ANU) commenced the development of the Australian Hydrological Geospatial Fabric (Geofabric). Geofabric is being developed to underpin the Australian Water Resources Information System (AWRIS) within a single, consistent, national geospatial framework for hydrological features. Geoscience Australia's role in the Geofabric is to provide the best available national topographic spatial data for surface water features based on the National Topographic Data and Map Specifications. The river basin boundaries have been aligned (by Melbourne Water) to Melbourne Water Corporation (MWC) drainage catchments, to produce a consistent drainage and waterways catchment dataset to State level, since 2005.\n\n\n\nNOTE: Whilst every effort has been taken in collecting, validating and providing the attached data, Melbourne Water Corporation makes no representations or guarantees as to the accuracy or completeness of this data. Any person or group that uses this data does so at its own risk and should make their own assessment and investigations as to the suitability and/or application of the data. Melbourne Water Corporation shall not be liable in any way to any person or group for loss of any kind including damages, costs, interest, loss of profits or special loss or damage, arising from any use, error, inaccuracy, incompleteness or other defect in this data.",

    "description": "The digital State Boundaries and their legal identifiers have been derived from the cadastre data from each state and territory jurisdiction and are available below.\r\n\r\nState Boundaries are part of Geoscape Administrative Boundaries, which is built and maintained by  [Geoscape Australia](https://geoscape.com.au/) using authoritative government data. Further information about contributors to Administrative Boundaries is available [here](https://geoscape.com.au/legal/data-copyright-and-disclaimer/).\r\n\r\nThe full Administrative Boundaries dataset contains boundaries in seven themes: Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) boundaries, electoral boundaries, state and territory boundaries, local government areas, suburbs/localities, wards and town points.\r\n\r\nAs at November 2019, users have the option to download datasets with feature coordinates referencing the new Geocentric Datum of Australia 2020 (GDA2020) in addition to datasets on the GDA94 datum.\r\n\r\nFor GDA2020 datasets, the name of the zip folder and the root folder (once extracted) include a reference to GDA2020. For GDA94 datasets, the zip and root folder names do not contain the datum name (i.e. they remain the same as previous releases).\r\n\r\nFor example, the zip and root folder for Administrative Boundaries downloaded in GDA2020 for November 2019 looks like this:\r\n\r\n       •\tNOV19_AdminBounds_ESRIShapefileorDBFfile_GDA2020; or \r\n       •\tNOV19_AdminBounds_MapInfoTABFormat_GDA2020\r\n\r\nThe zip and root folder for Administrative Boundaries in GDA94 for November 2019 looks like this: \r\n\r\n       •\tNOV19_AdminBounds_ESRIShapefileorDBFfile; or \r\n       •\tNOV19_AdminBounds_MapInfoTABFormat\r\n\r\nIrrespective of the datum chosen, files within the respective folder use exactly the same naming structures.\r\n\r\nFurther information on Administrative Boundaries, including FAQs on the data, is available [here](https://geoscape.com.au/data/administrative-boundaries/) through Geoscape Australia’s network of [partners](https://geoscape.com.au/partners/). They provide a range of commercial products based on Administrative Boundaries, including software solutions, consultancy and support.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## License Information\r\n\r\nThe Australian Government has negotiated the release of Administrative Boundaries to the whole economy under an [open CCBY 4.0 license](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).\r\n\r\nUsers must only use the data in ways that are consistent with the Australian Privacy Principles issued under the Privacy Act 1988 (Cth).\r\n\r\n**Users must also note the following attribution requirements:**\r\n\r\n_Preferred attribution for the Licensed Material:_\r\n\r\n> _Administrative Boundaries © [Geoscape Australia](https://geoscape.com.au/legal/data-copyright-and-disclaimer/) licensed by the Commonwealth of Australia under_ [_Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International licence (CC BY 4.0)_](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).\r\n\r\n_Preferred attribution for Adapted Material:_\r\n\r\n> _Incorporates or developed using Administrative Boundaries © [Geoscape Australia](https://geoscape.com.au/legal/data-copyright-and-disclaimer/) licensed by the Commonwealth of Australia under_ [_Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International licence (CC BY 4.0)_](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).",

    "description": "The Collaborative Australian Protected Areas Database (CAPAD) 2016 provides both spatial and textual information about government, Indigenous and privately protected areas for Australia, in both the marine and terrestrial environments. This dataset is the marine component of the CAPAD only. Marine CAPAD provides information about off-shore protected areas in both state and Commonwealth waters.  State and Territory conservation agencies supplied data current to 30 June 2016. This is the eighth version of the marine database, with previous versions released in 1997, 2002, 2004, 2008, 2010, 2012 and 2014.\n\nThe Department also publishes protected areas data for the terrestrial environment. The terrestrial component of the database has been previously released in 1997, 2000, 2002, 2004, 2006, 2008 2010, 2012 and 2014.\n\nCAPAD provides a snapshot of protected areas that meet the IUCN definition of a protected area: \"A protected area is an area of land and/or sea especially dedicated to the protection and maintenance of biological diversity, and of natural and associated cultural resources, and managed through legal or other effective means\" (IUCN 1994).\n\nThe department publishes a summary of the CAPAD data biennially on its website at http://www.environment.gov.au/capad/ \n\nThis version of CAPAD is a public and downloadable version of CAPAD 2016 data, available for use through the CC-BY licencing model. \n\nCommercial users: Commercial users should note the availability of a more descriptive dataset for Commonwealth Marine Reserves. It is recommended for use in commercial applications as it includes additional information about management arrangements for Commonwealth Marine Reserves. This dataset is available under Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial license from:\nhttp://intspat01.ris.environment.gov.au/fed/catalog/search/resource/details.page?uuid=%7B2E8DD19C-1B93-4D90-BD1C-128DDC4A2998%7D\n\n ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIMPORTANT INFORMATION FOR MARINE USERS – TRANSITIONAL ARRANGEMENTS\nThe process for developing management plans has been completed for the five Commonwealth marine reserve networks declared around Australia and the Coral Sea Commonwealth Marine Reserve. Until the new management plans come into effect transitional management arrangements are in place. Under these transitional arrangements, there are no changes \"on the water\" for users in the new areas added to the Commonwealth marine reserve estate. If people hold an existing approval to undertake activities within Commonwealth marine reserves or the now-revoked Coral Sea Conservation Zone, they are able to continue to operate under the terms of the existing approval. No additional administrative requirements apply.\nThe management plan for the South-east Network came into effect on 1 July 2013, while the management plans for the South-west, North-west, North and Temperate East Networks and the Coral Sea Commonwealth Marine Reserve are under review. More information is available at http://www.environment.gov.au/topics/marine/marine-reserves\n\n ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nMain attributes in Marine CAPAD 2016 include:\n\nPA_ID: The protected area ID code. The first three digits of the PA_ID code are common to all component polygons of a single protected area. It is a DoEE generated number.\n\nNAME: the name of the protected area. \n\nTYPE: the type of protected area according to the protected area establishment mechanism. \n\nTYPE_ABBR: the abbreviation of the TYPE. \n\nTYPE abbreviations:\nAQR = Aquatic Reserve\nCA = Conservation Area\nCMR = Commonwealth Marine Reserve\nCP = Conservation Park\nDPAA = Dugong Protection Area (A)\nDPAB = Dugong Protection Area (B)\nDS = Dolphin Sanctuary\nFHAA = Fish Habitat Area (A)\nFHAB = Fish Habitat Area (B)\nFHPA = Fish Habitat Protection Area\nGR = Game Reserve\nIPA = Indigenous Protected Area\nLS = Rock Lobster Sanctuary\nMCA = Marine Conservation Area\nMMA = Marine Management Area\nMNP = Marine National Park\nMNR = Marine Nature Reserve\nMP = Marine Park\nMS = Marine Sanctuary\nNP = National Park\nNPC = National Park (Commonwealth)\nNPS4 = National Parks Act - Schedule 4 park or reserve\nNR = Nature Reserve\nSH = Shipwreck Reserve\nS5G = 5(1)(g) Reserve\nS5H = 5(1)(h) Reserve\n\nIUCN: the IUCN protected area management category ascribed by the Managing authority, as outlined in the publication: CNPPA/WCMC \"Guidelines for Protected Area management categories\". Gland: IUCN, 1994. (ISBN: 2-8317-0201-1).\n\nIUCN definitions:\nIA = Strict Nature Reserve: managed mainly for science;\nIB = Wilderness Area: managed mainly for wilderness protection;\nII = National Park: managed mainly for ecosystem protection;\nIII = Natural Monument: managed mainly for conservation of specific natural features;\nIV = Habitat / Species Management Area: managed mainly for conservation through management intervention;\nV = Protected Landscape / Seascape: managed mainly for landscape/seascape conservation and recreation;\nVI = Managed Resource Protected Area: managed mainly for the sustainable use of natural ecosystems.\nNA = (Not applicable) - Denotes an area that does not meet the NRS criteria or the IUCN definition of a protected area but has management complimentary to the NRS.\n\nNRS_MPA: This attribute indicates whether the protected area meets the standard for inclusion in the NRSMPA or is managed for nature conservation without meeting the NRSMPA standard. For marine reserves refer to the “Guidelines for Establishing the National Representative System of Marine Protected Areas (NRSMPA)\n\nNRS_MPA code definitions:\n\"Y\" = Yes. The sea has been assessed as a protected area that meets the standard for inclusion in the NRSMPA.\n\"N\" = No. The sea has been assessed as not meeting the standard for inclusion in the NRSMPA. It is managed for nature conservation without meeting the NRSMPA standard.\n\"ND\" = Not Determined. The sea is managed for nature conservation although it has not been assessed to determine if it meets the standard for inclusion in the NRSMPA.\n\nGAZ_AREA: area in hectares as described in the nomination document (e.g. parliamentary gazettal), to the nearest hectare. Some protected areas do not have a specific area in the designation.\n\nGIS_AREA: area in hectares based on current spatial data and an Albers equal area projection for Australia. It is this field that is used to calculate the statistics provided in spreadsheets at: www.environment.gov.au/capad/\n\nREPT_AREA: is the same as GIS_AREA. (Previously REPT_AREA was based on the GAZ_AREA attribute and if this was a null value then the GIS_AREA was used. Due to the fact that not all received data had REPT_AREA, it was incomplete and inconsistent, so REPT_AREA is no longer used for analysis).\n\nGAZ_DATE: the first gazettal or proclamation date that established any protected area at this site. A default date of 01/01/1900 is applied for undated and unlabelled polygons supplied to the department.\n\nLATEST_GAZ: the date of the most recent gazettal or proclamation to amend the protected area. It can be the same date as the GAZ_DATE.\n\nSTATE: The state is the state or territory that the protected area is located in. COM = protected areas located in Commonwealth Waters. EXT= protected areas located in Australian external territories.\n\nAUTHORITY: The Authority responsible for the management of the protected area mechanism. \n\nAUTHORITY abbreviations:\nDOEE  =  Australian Government, Department of the Environment and Energy\nGBRMPA = Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority\nIMG = Indigenous Management Group\nNSW_DPI = NSW Department of Primary Industries\nNT_PWCNT= Parks and Wildlife Commission of the NT\nPIRSA = Primary Industries and Regions South Australia\nQLD_DEEDI = QLD Department of Employment, Economic Development and Innovation\nQLD_NPSR  =  Queensland Department of National Parks, Sport and Racing\nSA_DEWNR = South Australian Department of Environment, Water and Natural Resources \nTAS_DPIPWE = Tasmanian Department of Primary Industries, Parks, Water and Environment\nTSRA = Torres Strait Regional Authority\nVIC_DELWP  =  Victorian Department of Environment, Land, Water and Planning\nWA_DOF = Western Australian Department of Fisheries\nWA_DPAW = Western Australian Department of Parks and Wildlife\n\nDATASOURCE: Describes the source of the data for the protected area. \n\nDATASOURCE abbreviations:\nDOEE  =  Australian Government, Department of the Environment and Energy\nGBRMPA = Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority\nNSW_DPI = NSW Department of Primary Industries\nNT_PWCNT= Parks and Wildlife Commission of the NT\nPIRSA = Primary Industries and Regions South Australia\nQLD_DEEDI = QLD Department of Employment, Economic Development and Innovation\nQLD_NPSR  =  Queensland Department of National Parks, Sport and Racing\nSA_DEWNR = South Australian Department of Environment, Water and Natural Resources \nTAS_DPIPWE = Tasmanian Department of Primary Industries, Parks, Water and Environment\nTSRA = Torres Strait Regional Authority\nVIC_DELWP  =  Victorian Department of Environment, Land, Water and Planning\nWA_DOF = Western Australian Department of Fisheries\nWA_DPAW = Western Australian Department of Parks and Wildlife\n\nGOVERNANCE: Records the type of governance that has management and decision making responsibility. \n\nGovernance code definitions: G = Government, C = Community (conserved areas including indigenous peoples or local communities) or J = Joint.\n\nCOMMENTS: Extra information jurisdictions elect to supply. Due to the change in ENVIRON based categorisation rules in the 2016 version of CAPAD, it has been noted in the COMMENTS field of marine CAPAD if a record was previously included in terrestrial CAPAD.\n\nENVIRON: A protected area gazetted as terrestrial may have a marine component and vice versa. A protected area can be 'T' terrestrial, marine 'M' or both 'B'. Terrestrial CAPAD 2016 contains 'T' and 'B' records. Marine CAPAD 2016 contains 'M' and ‘B’ records. If a record is coded as ‘B’ by the data provider, DOEE calculates the proportional representation of marine and terrestrial areas within the polygon. If 70% or more of the area of the reserve is marine then the whole record is included in this dataset. If less than 70% of the area of the reserve is marine then the whole record is included in the terrestrial CAPAD dataset. In previous versions of CAPAD only ‘M’ records were included in Marine CAPAD.\n\nX_COORD: is the longitude in decimal degrees east within the object closest to the centre of the object using the Geocentric Datum of Australia 1994.\n\nY_COORD: is the latitude in decimal degrees south within the object closest to the centre of the object using the Geocentric Datum of Australia 1994.\n\nMGT_PLAN: The code of the status of the management plan for the protected area.\n\nMGT_PLAN code definitions:\nP = In Preparation - Some form of management document was being prepared.\nD = Draft - A draft management document was released for comment by the public, management board or equivalent.\nS = Statutory - Enabling legislation establishes the management of a protected area and separate management document is not required.\nI = Management Intent - A formal statement of management intent has been prepared that clearly sets out the management objectives for the protected area but includes little else.\nM = Management Plan - A formally adopted management plan that has been through consultation and contains strategies and actions for implementation for this protected area. \nR = Regional Plan - A formally adopted management plan has been through consultation and contains general strategies and actions for implementation over a group of protected areas.\nN = Unknown - No form of management document could be found.\nUR = Under Review - The management plan is under review\n\nRES_NUMBER: The reserve number (if declared) as used by the controlling authority. IPA Reserve numbers are allocated by DOEE.\n\nZONE_TYPE: This is a concatenation of the ZONE (usually found in the COMMENTS field) and IUCN categories – for use when mapping the reserves.\nEPBC: This identifies if the reserve can be considered under the Commonwealth Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 (EPBC Act). It will be used to identify Commonwealth features for inclusion in the Protected Matters Search Tool. \n\nEPBC code descriptions:\nCommonwealth = Commonwealth reserve (either a Commonwealth Marine Reserve, Marine Park, Marine Sanctuary, National Park (Commonwealth)) – as outlined in Section 342 of the Act.\nState = State managed reserve – as supplied by State/Territory authority\n\nPA_ID_grp: The first three digits of the PA_ID code that identifies unique protected areas. It does not change between versions of CAPAD.CC - Attribution (CC BY)\nThis dataset is available under the CC-BY data licencing model and users are required to acknowledge the Australian Government, Department of the Environment and Energy as the source of the data in any of their uses.

    "description": "The <strong>Climate Vulnerability Assessment</strong> was designed to provide an overview of the impact of future climate change on all stages of production for the commodities and biosecurity risks assessed. The project used multicriteria analysis (MCA) models to produce assessments for the commodities and biosecurity risks in a consistent and comparable way, and a framework was developed to provide a rigorous, flexible and transparent process for assessing vulnerabilities and opportunities to climate change. Details of the approach and the climate data used in the assessments can be found in the <a href=\"https://www.dpi.nsw.gov.au/dpi/climate/climate-vulnerability-assessment/publications-and-reports\">Methodology Report</a> which also details model exclusions and assumptions.\n\nAssessments were undertaken on commodities grouped into 6 nodes: <em>Horticulture and Viticulture</em>, <em>Broadacre Cropping</em>, <em>Forestry</em>, <em>Extensive Livestock</em>, <em>Marine Fisheries</em>, as well as for a set of biosecurity risks related to these primary industry sectors. The <a href=\"https://www.dpi.nsw.gov.au/dpi/climate/climate-vulnerability-assessment/publications-and-reports\">Summary Report</a> gives details of the chosen commodities and biosecurity risks and summarises the high-level results.\n\nResults Reports for each commodity and biosecurity risk are being released. Visit the <a href=\"https://www.dpi.nsw.gov.au/dpi/climate/climate-vulnerability-assessment\">project's web pages</a> to access these reports and for further information.\n\nThis dataset contains maps of modelled climate suitability for the <strong>lupin</strong> model in the Broadacre Cropping node of the DPIRD Climate Vulnerability Assessment. Maps are provided (in GeoTIFF format) for each element of the model: the overall climate suitability, climate suitability maps for each phenophase and also for each phenophase/climate variable combination in the model. Data is provided for each of the eight global climate models (GCMs) used in the project, as well as the climate suitability derived from historical observations, along with the ensemble median for each map.",

The Future Reef MAP project is funded by Rio Tinto Alcan and administered by the Great Barrier Reef Foundation, with an equal co-investment by CSIRO. The project is the first large-scale CO2 observing system established on the Great Barrier Reef using the Rio Tinto ship, RTM Wakmatha. The research is targeted at providing information on the CO2 uptake and the controls on ocean acidification change in the region. It is providing foundation data needed to assess the vulnerability of the GBR reefs to ocean acidification. This dataset contains quality controlled underway measurements of the fugacity of CO2, atmospheric pressure, and sea surface temperature and salinity. The data management and distribution of these data were supported by the CSIRO Carbon Collaboration Cluster and the Australian Coastal Ecosystem Facility.",

    "description": "A current meter mooring was deployed in the NE section of Jervis Bay between 6/12/88 and 11/1/89. This 'Blue' mooring (35.035 S, 150.753 E) held one S4 Interocean current meter at a depth of 5.5 metres below sea-level, and one Aanderaa RCM4S current meter at 11.5 mbsl. \n\nEach of these current meters provided two datasets. In the first, the meter integrates the signals over 1 minutes every 10 minutes, providing 10 min sample readings. The second decimated the samples using a running mean to provide hourly intervals.\n\nThe data provided in all these datasets includes the eastern and northern tidal components, speed, direction and temperature. The datasets providing the 10 minute sample values also give depth and salinity readings.\n\n**Unfortunately one dataset is missing from this collection: the file containing the 10min sample readings for the meter at 5.5m has not been located**\n\nThis is one of four child records that relate to the parent, 06bf0e30-2ae3-11dd-a735-00188b4c0af8. A pdf outlining the structure and hierarchy of all metadata records relating to this project is available to download through this record.

    "description": "This record describes components of the 'Jervis Bay Baseline Studies' project conducted by the Department of Defence, CSIRO and Australian Defence Force Academy (ADFA). The initial aims of the project were to obtain current and wind observations from Jervis bay over a six week period in order to detail the wind driven circulation and provide a data set for comparison with the numerical modelling work being simultaneously undertaken. However, after this initial experiment it became clear that there were significant currents in the bay that are not simply related to direct wind forcing. Therefore, alternative mechanisms for driving the flow had to be investigated, through the measurement programs and data analysis, as well as through numerical modelling. The result was a series of approximately six separate experiments aiming to define the water circulation around the bay and through the bay entrance, to gain an understanding of the processes that drive the currents, and to investigate the influence of stratification on the nature of the currents.\n\nThis record doesn't describe one of these six  experiments per se, but the data collected from a meteorological station at Governor Head. This Steedman EMS-16 meteorological station housed a R.M. Young anemometer and YSI barometer to measure wind and atmospheric pressure respectively. The site at Governor Head was several hundred metres inland of 50m high cliffs and was 63m above sea-level.\n\nWind data was also collected from an anemometer located at Huskisson, on the west shore of Jervis Bay. This anemometer was operated at the time by the NSW Public Works Department.\n\nAs this is a parent record, no data is available to download. A pdf outlining the structure and hierarchy of metadata records relating to this project is available through this record. Also provided is a pdf of a working paper that describes the operating and data processing procedures that relate to the meteorological station. There are 36 subsiduary records that directly relate to this parent, through which the data is provided (see hierarchical tree).",

    "description": "Rice farms in the Murray-Darling Basin  presents key farm performance measures for irrigated rice growing farms in the Basin, including data on water trading and use of irrigation technologies, with an emphasis on results from 2012-13 to 2014-15. \r\n\r\n ABARES has conducted surveys of irrigation farms in selected industries and regions in the Murray-Darling Basin since 2006-07. The Murray-Darling Basin Authority (MDBA) funded this latest survey. \r\n\r\n This report focused on rice growing farms in the southern Murray-Darling Basin, where almost all of Australia's rice is produced. \r\n\r\n After 100 per cent closing water allocations in 2012-13, there were falls in allocations in 2013-14 and particularly in 2014-15. Average farm cash incomes in 2014-15 fell by around 28 per cent to around $132 000. The average rate of return was 1.7 per cent, higher than the average for all survey years of 1.3 per cent. \r\n\r\n All rice growers used flood irrigation because of the need to apply large volumes of water to rice crops at high delivery rates. \r\n\r\n In most survey years, a majority of rice farms did not buy or sell irrigation water. Of those farms that did trade water, there were more sellers than buyers of water. On average, sellers of water recorded higher rates of return on capital than either buyers or those not trading water. ",

Data are lists of presence-absence of 215 native plant species (i.e., exotic species removed) from 76 seasonal wetlands (size range 0.5 - 35 ha) located on the Fleurieu Peninsula, South Australia (centred on latitude 35.5 °S). After data were collated into a single dataset, sampling bias was removed to create a dataset of near-complete census wetlands. Spatial data: For each of the 76 wetlands a small amount of spatial data is also provided, i.e., area, centroids, catchment etc.  \nThe dataset could be of interest for any typical community data analysis (e.g. beta diversity, similarity, assembly)- provided only native wetland plant species are of interest. Data presented here were used to model extinction risk, species-area relationships, occupancy distributions and so on.",

This voyage was staffed by only one GSM team member, thus 24 hours acquisition was not possible and there may be gaps in the data record.\n\nThe EM2040MK2 provides a 0.4 degree by 0.7 degree angular resolution. The echosounder's nominal frequency is 400 kHz (with a range of 200-700 kHz) and it operated in dual swath mode. \n\nData are stored in <em>.kmall raw format for bathymetry and backscatter and </em>.kmwcd format for watercolumn backscatter at CSIRO. There are 22 files totalling 5.91 GB of raw data and 22 files totalling 66.0 GB of watercolumn data in this dataset. \n\nSound velocity profiles were applied to this data during data acquisition. Bathymetry data contained in *.kmall format are corrected for motion and position. \n\nGPS tide was computed using the EGM2008 model and applied to the processed data. Processed data has had outliers removed. \n\nAdditional information regarding this dataset, including further information on processing streams, is contained in the GSM data acquisition and processing report.",

Hydrology usually consists of salinity and nutrient values obtained by analysing water samples taken at several depths at each station.\n\nThe subset extracted for MARVL contains data on the continental shelf as defined by the 200 metre depth contour from the 2012 Bathymetric dataset merged (spatial union) with the Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) in the Australian Maritime Boundary dataset (http://www.ga.gov.au/metadata-gateway/metadata/record/gcat_63565) available from Geosciences Australia (GA).  This subset of the data contains 2,555 Hydrology station records from 78 surveys and includes temperature, pressure and salinity and spans from 1995 to the present.\n\nThe full data set is held in the O&A Information & Datacentre Data Warehouse, which currently holds over 31,796 Hydrology station records from more than 601 surveys collected since 42.  This data includes temperature, pressure and salinity, and may also include any or all of nitrate, nitrite, oxygen, phosphate, silicate and ammonia. Individual metadata records have been created for each research voyage.",

    "description": "Data describes habitat suitability modelling (HSM) results for platypus. The data was developed by the University of Melbourne through the Melbourne Waterways Research Practice Partnership as part of the development of Melbourne Water’s Healthy Waterways Strategy 2018 (HWS2018). Analysis has been undertaken across the Melbourne Water operating region, where the operating region has been divided into 16,346 sub-catchments. Of these 16,346 subcatchments, 8233 contain Melbourne Water waterways. The results are presented for each of these 8233 reaches. The data was used to estimate scores for platypus presented in the HWS for three scenarios:Current: habitat suitability for platypus under current conditions (i.e. 2014).Current trajectory: habitat suitability for platypus under urbanisation and climate change scenarios if current management approaches continue.Target trajectory: habitat suitability for platypus given urbanisation and climate change (as for current trajectory), together with (a) delivery of performance objectives of the Healthy Waterways Strategy and (b) achievement of environmental condition scores as described in the Catchment Programs of the Healthy Waterways Strategy. Presentation of habitat suitabilty model results for platypus from the Healthy Waterways Strategy 2018. Habitat Suitability Model results have been thoroughly reviewed and are considered fit for purpose (i.e. for waterway planning). This data set covers the entire Melbourne Water region with the exception of very small areas close to Port Phillip Bay or Western Port. For example, there are small areas of French Island which are not captured.This data set was created using: 1. Streams dataset for the Healthy Waterways Strategy 2018. This layer was developed by GraceGIS using Melbourne Water layers as inputs. 2. Results from Habitat Suitability Modelling for the Healthy Waterways Strategy 2018. Further reading: Chee et al.

The Future Reef MAP project is funded by Rio Tinto Alcan and administered by the Great Barrier Reef Foundation, with an equal co-investment by CSIRO. The project is the first large-scale CO2 observing system established on the Great Barrier Reef using the Rio Tinto ship, RTM Wakmatha. The research is targeted at providing information on the CO2 uptake and the controls on ocean acidification change in the region. It is providing foundation data needed to assess the vulnerability of the GBR reefs to ocean acidification. This dataset contains quality controlled underway measurements of the fugacity of CO2, atmospheric pressure, and sea surface temperature and salinity. The data management and distribution of these data were supported by the CSIRO Carbon Collaboration Cluster and the Australian Coastal Ecosystem Facility.",
