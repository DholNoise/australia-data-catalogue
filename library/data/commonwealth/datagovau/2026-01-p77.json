    "description": "The Ground Cover Disturbance Index (GCDI) is an index developed by the Biodiversity Assessment Team (BAT) within EHP, which assesses aspects of rangeland biodiversity condition. It relates the ground cover time series statistics from the State Land and Tree Study (SLATS) to the Regional Ecosystem (RE) framework. The primary data input for the index is a percentage ground cover time series, derived from SLATS Landsat TM imagery over Queensland. The GCDI analyses levels of ground cover within each RE, as different REs naturally have different ground cover percentages. Within each RE, by subregion, the mean and trend of the ground cover is calculated since 1988, with different combinations of mean and trend indicating the level of disturbance.GCDI can be calculated in areas with foliage projective cover less than 20%, ie where the satellites can see the ground cover layer through the trees. The GCDI method also requires RE mapping, and only applies in areas that are considered remnant.The GCDI model assumes that climatic conditions (temperature, rainfall, etc) are consistent within a subregion. It also relates the ground cover time series statistics to the dominant ecosystem (RE1_ROOT) in the RE layer.This dataset needs to be viewed in conjunction with the low change and water bodies layers also supplied with this package.",

This dataset is based on Statistical Area Level 4 (SA4) from the 2011 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS) boundaries, and covers data for individual months between October 1998 and June 2020.\nLabour Force statistics are compiled from the Labour Force Survey which is conducted each month throughout Australia as part of the ABS household survey program. The Labour Force Survey provides monthly information about the labour market activity of Australia's resident civilian population aged 15 years and over. The Labour Force Survey is designed to primarily provide estimates of employment and unemployment for the whole of Australia and, secondarily, for each state and territory.\nThis data is ABS data (catalogue number: 6291.0.55.001) used with permission from the Australian Bureau of Statistics.\nFor more information please visit the Australian Bureau of Statistics.\nPlease Note: \n\n\nThe original dataset includes data between July 1991 and October 1998, however these records are not aggregated by SA4, and therefore have been omitted from this dataset.\n\n\nAURIN has restructured and spatially enabled the original data using the 2011 SA4 Boundaries.\n\n",

    "description": "    \r\n\r\nThe data shows areas of dryland salinity risk in 2000 in the Murray-Darling\r\nBasin within NSW and coastal NSW catchments.Areas of risk are based on\r\ngroundwater levels and air photo interpretation. The merged data, at a nominal\r\nscale of 1:250 000, show actual areas where dryland salinity or water-tables\r\nless than 2 metres have been measured. For the extent map, every delineated\r\narea is underpinned by either air photo data or by one or more groundwater\r\nbores. Therefore, the area at risk is regarded as conservative due to\r\nlimitations in the spatial coverage of air photo and bore data.  number of\r\ntechniques to spatially extrapolate these data to infer potential areas at\r\nrisk were trialed but were considered scientifically or statistically\r\ninadequate. Estimates of impacts are based on areas at risk having groundwater\r\nlevels of less than 2 m. An impact assessment based on groundwater less than 5\r\nm and rising was considered inappropriate. Total areas affected with\r\ngroundwater less than 5 m and rising have been presented, but only for\r\nimproved consistency with other States.\r\n\r\nSee [further metadata](http://data.daff.gov.au/anrdl/metadata_files/pa_dsa__r1in\r\n__00111a01.xml) for more detail.\r\n\r\n",

This makes interpretation of incidence using only notification data difficult. For the purposes of this indicator notification rates for both unspecified and newly acquired hepatitis B are presented in the table below and represent prevalence as a surrogate for incidence.\r\n\r\nIt is important to recognise that for hepatitis B infections, notifications to the National Notifiable Disease Surveillance System (NNDSS) represent only a proportion of the total cases and may be influenced by changes to testing patterns.\r\n\r\nFurther information can be found here > http://www9.health.gov.au/cda/source/cda-index.cfm \r\n\r\n",

MMM is based on the Australian Statistical Geography Standard – Remoteness Areas (ASGS-RA) and is updated after each national Census conducted by the ABS.\r\n\r\nStatistical Area Level 2 (SA2)\r\n\r\nSA2s are geographic units used in the Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS). Built from SA1s, they are designed to represent communities with shared social and economic interactions. There are 2,473 SA2s across Australia, including special codes for populations without fixed locations.

This aggregation not only ensures that individual schools remain\nunidentified, but also presents a summary of overall electricity usage within\nparticular geographic localities. In addition, median usage is presented\ninstead of average (mean) values to account for extreme levels of consumption\nthat can give a skewed indication of overall LGA usage.\nWhile there are figures for nearly all LGAs there are some for which no values\nare shown. This may be due to insufficient or non-available data, or to ensure\nconfidentiality of individual schools in LGAs with a small number of schools.",

The Future Reef MAP project is funded by Rio Tinto Alcan and administered by the Great Barrier Reef Foundation, with an equal co-investment by CSIRO. The project is the first large-scale CO2 observing system established on the Great Barrier Reef using the Rio Tinto ship, RTM Wakmatha. The research is targeted at providing information on the CO2 uptake and the controls on ocean acidification change in the region. It is providing foundation data needed to assess the vulnerability of the GBR reefs to ocean acidification. This dataset contains quality controlled underway measurements of the fugacity of CO2, atmospheric pressure, and sea surface temperature and salinity. The data management and distribution of these data were supported by the CSIRO Carbon Collaboration Cluster and the Australian Coastal Ecosystem Facility.",

    "description": "This dataset presents information about total income distribution. The data covers the financial year of 2012-2013, and is based on Statistical Area Level 2 (SA2) according to the 2016 edition of the Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nTotal Income is the sum of all reported income derived from Employee income, Own unincorporated business, Superannuation, Investments and Other income. Total income does not include the non-lodger population.\nGovernment pensions, benefits or allowances are excluded from the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) income data and do not appear in Other income or Total income. Pension recipients can fall below the income threshold that necessitates them lodging a tax return, or they may only receive tax free pensions or allowances. Hence they will be missing from the personal income tax data set. Recent estimates from the ABS Survey of Income and Housing (which records Government pensions and allowances) suggest that this component can account for between 9% to 11% of Total income.\nAll monetary values are presented as gross pre-tax dollars, as far as possible. This means they reflect income before deductions and loses, and before any taxation or levies (e.g. the Medicare levy or the temporary budget repair levy) are applied. The amounts shown are nominal, they have not been adjusted for inflation. The income presented in this release has been categorised into income types, these categories have been devised by the ABS to closely align to ABS definitions of income.\nThe statistics in this release are compiled from the Linked Employer Employee Dataset (LEED), a cross-sectional database based on administrative data from the Australian taxation system. The LEED includes more than 120 million tax records over seven consecutive years between 2011-12 and 2017-18.\nPlease note:\n\n\nAll personal income tax statistics included in LEED were provided in de-identified form with no home address or date of birth. Addresses were coded to the ASGS and date of birth was converted to an age at 30 June of the reference year prior to data provision.\n\n\nTo minimise the risk of identifying individuals in aggregate statistics, perturbation has been applied to the statistics in this release. Perturbation involves small random adjustment of the statistics and is considered the most satisfactory technique for avoiding the release of identifiable statistics, while maximising the range of information that can be released. These adjustments have a negligible impact on the underlying pattern of the statistics. Some cells have also been suppressed due to low counts.\n\n\nTotals may not align with the sum of their components due to missing or unpublished information in the underlying data and perturbation.\n\n\nFor further information please visit the Australian Bureau of Statistics.\nAURIN has made the following changes to the original data:\n\n\nSpatially enabled the original data.\n\n\nSet 'np' (not published to protect the confidentiality of individuals or businesses) values to Null.\n\n",

This dataset contains reports, data and metadata used in the flood study, and results data for the existing floodplain condition scenarios.  \n\nCouncil is committed to ensuring we have the latest flood modelling data to help manage flood risk in Brisbane. Flood studies provide Council with technical data to inform policy and for managing flooding within the Brisbane River and local creek and overland flow catchments.  \n\nThe Citywide Creek and Overland Flow Path Mapping Flood Study comprises a series of 27 individual sub-models which cover the entire Brisbane City Council area. Results data for flood height, depth and hazard (depth x velocity) are available for each individual sub-model for the 2, 5, 10, 20, 50, 100, 500 and 2000 year Average Recurrence Interval (ARI) storm events.   \n\nFor specific details on how the study was conducted, the areas it covers, and before using the data please read the flood study report. The flood study report, metadata used in the flood study and a detailed map that shows the 27 individual sub-models has also been made available in open data and is called <a href=\"https://data.brisbane.qld.gov.au/explore/dataset/flood-study-citywide-overland-flow-reference\">Flood Study — Citywide Overland Flow — reference</a>.  \n\nThe data on the table tab is the metadata relating to the data used for flood modelling in the Brisbane City Council Citywide Creek and Overland Flow Path Mapping Flood Study.   \n\nMore information on flood studies and how this information is used can be found on the <a href=\"https://www.brisbane.qld.gov.au/community-safety/community-safety/disasters-emergencies/be-prepared/flooding-brisbane/flood-strategy/flood-studies\">Brisbane City Council Website</a>.\nThe image below shows the 27 individual sub-models of the flood study and can be used to identify the sub-model for your location of interest.\n\n  ",

Site selection was influenced by the history of long-term monitoring work undertaken in this area by the Darwin Centre for Bushfire Research (formerly Bushfires NT). The core 1 ha plot is dominated by <em>Eucalyptus miniata</em> and <em>Eucalyptus tetrodonta</em>. The site is representative of the dominant ecosystem type across northern Australia: frequently burnt tropical savanna in high rainfall areas. For additional site information, see <a href=\"https://www.tern.org.au/tern-observatory/tern-ecosystem-processes/litchfield-savanna-supersite\">Litchfield Savanna SuperSite</a>\n\n\nIn 2020 four acoustic recorders were set up to collect audio data continuously as part of the Australian Acoustic Observatory (A2O) project. Two recorders were placed in relatively wet habitats and two in relatively dry habitats.",

Offering the largest amount of stars in any given direction in the sky, the GC is widely cited as a location believed to harbour advanced civilizations, and it is also the most energetic region in the Milky Way. We aim to conduct BL-GC Survey with Parkes radio telescope for around 350 hours. We will cover the frequency range from 700 MHz to 4 GHz, utilizing the newly installed ultra-wideband receiver. Our team has already leveraged both standard and bespoke tools to construct a flexible software stack to search data for signals of interest. We will look for signals from extraterrestrial intelligence (ETI) by searching for both simple narrow-band signals and complex modulated signals. Along with that, as an ancillary science, we will also search for accelerated pulsars — likely orbiting a supermassive black hole at the centre of the Milky Way Galaxy. Data products produced during this program will also be publically available to engage larger pulsar community",

The data is based on the recipient's geocoded address aggregated by Local Government Area (LGA) from the Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS) 2014.\nThe Department of Social Services (DSS) is the Australian Government's lead agency in the development and delivery of social policy, and is working to improve the lifetime wellbeing of people and families in Australia. DSS' policies and services respond to need across people's lives - looking after families, children and older people; providing a safety net for people who cannot fully support themselves; enhancing the wellbeing of people with high needs; assisting people who need help with care; and supporting a diverse and harmonious society. DSS supports people and families in Australia by encouraging independence and participation, and supporting a cohesive society.\nFor more information on this dataset please visit the Australian Government Open Data.\nFor further details on payments, see 'A guide to Australian Government payments'.\nPlease note:\n\n\nIn order to protect individuals' privacy, identified populations between 1 and 4 have been suppressed and replaced with '&lt;5' for confidentiality purposes. Additional data may be suppressed and replaced with 'n.p.' (not provided) to prevent the derivation of identified populations that have values of less than 5.\n\n\nIndividuals who live overseas, individuals who are without a valid home address and individuals who only have a postal address cannot be assigned to a locational boundary. State/territory totals derived from Local Government Area data will not match actual state and territory totals, due to different statistical geography methodologies.\n\n\nCaveats specific to payments type can be found in the relevant payment description of the original data.\n\n\nAURIN has spatialised this dataset and have made the following replacements to enforce data type consistency: \n\n\n'&lt;5' has been assigned a value of '-1' within the data\n\n\nA boolean field has been created for each data field to flag left-censored data. 'True' is assigned to fields that have been censored.\n\n\n'n.p.' (not provided) has been set to Null within the data.\n\n",

Monitoring is carried out by three different boat-based sampling parties, but is co-ordinated to occur on the same day each month. \nAt each site, in-situ field measurements are taken using calibrated sensors for temperature, salinity, pH, dissolved oxygen and turbidity. Water clarity is also measured using a secchi disk. Surface and bottom water samples are collected for analysis of true color, total suspended solids(TSS), total  and dissolved nutrients, organic carbon and zinc. at most sites, depth integrated samples are also collected for chlorophyll a using a plastic tube. Bottom samples in the Middle and Outer estuary are collected using a niskin bottle. Pumps are used in the upper estuary site to fill up the bottles. All water samples are analysed at Analytical Service Tasmania, a National Association of Testing Authorities-accredited laboratory. Monitoring site depth is 2 meters",

The project is the first large-scale CO2 observing system established on the Great Barrier Reef using the Rio Tinto ship, RTM Wakmatha. The research is targeted at providing information on the CO2 uptake and the controls on ocean acidification change in the region. It is providing foundation data needed to assess the vulnerability of the GBR reefs to ocean acidification. This dataset contains quality controlled underway measurements of the fugacity of CO2, atmospheric pressure, and sea surface temperature and salinity. The data management and distribution of these data were supported by the CSIRO Carbon Collaboration Cluster and the Australian Coastal Ecosystem Facility.",

    "description": "The 30 Year Investment Opportunities Framework will guide investment in the development of Melbourne’s metropolitan open space system.\nThe Framework responds to the following issues identified in the Open Space for Everyone Strategy:\n•   There is an existing inequity of access to open space provision across the metropolitan area.\n•   The current measures used to define this inequity are quantitative only, and is based on out-of-date data. \n•   There is currently no alternative cost effective and replicable, decision-making framework that considers qualitative and quantitative spatial data and information sources. \n•   Consequently, there is also no evidence-based metropolitan wide guidance as to ‘where to invest and why’ that would help address current inequity and respond to emerging needs.\n•   Melbourne doesn’t have an integrated, metropolitan-wide investment plan that identifies regional and landscape scale gaps in the network across municipal boundaries. \nThe Framework:\nThe Framework is a planning and investment tool that will be used by State Government, Local Government and Land Managers to prioritise funding to open space projects that have the greatest impact on health and wellbeing, creating a healthier biodiversity, responding to climate change and delivering social and economic benefits.\nThe Framework aligns to the Open Space for Everyone Strategy. Decision making criteria have been developed as qualitative and quantitative measures for the four Strategy goals:\n•   Improved community health and wellbeing.\n•   Healthier biodiversity.\n•   Enhanced climate change resilience.\n•   Maximised economic and social benefits.",

The data is aggregated to the 2020 edition of the Local Government Areas (LGA).\nThis data is ABS data available from the Australian Bureau of Statistics.\nFor more information please refer to the Methodology.\nEstimated resident population (ERP) is the official estimate of the Australian population, which links people to a place of usual residence within Australia. Usual residence within Australia refers to that address at which the person has lived or intends to live for six months or more in a given reference year. For the 30 June reference date, this refers to the calendar year around it. Estimates of the resident population are based on Census counts by place of usual residence (excluding short-term overseas visitors in Australia), with an allowance for Census net undercount, to which are added the estimated number of Australian residents temporarily overseas at the time of the Census. A person is regarded as a usual resident if they have been (or expected to be) residing in Australia for a period of 12 months or more over a 16-month period.",

The passenger OD movement data among different stations (or the station-based OD flow) are first estimated using a statistical estimation methodology. The stations-based OD flow data are then translated into region-based OD matrices using the state-of-art method. For more information please see the original metadata file here.\nHuman mobility data is a key ingredient in various areas and domains of research including epidemiology, policy and administration, criminology, transportation, logistics and supply chains, environmental management and, pollution and contamination. High quality human mobility data provided by telecommunication companies collected from call data records (CDRs) is available at prohibitive cost with restrictive licensing, keeping it out of reach for the majority of research community. On the other hand, there is an abundance of high-quality public data, reporting different aspects of mobility. Examples are the public transport patronage and information about the usage of the Australian road network. These datasets are collected by different organisations and government departments and are presented in various formats. For instance, data may be collected at different spatial (e.g. at state or postcode levels) and temporal scales and be presented in the form of passenger counts or aggregated movement flows. This dataset addresses the general lack of national scale comprehensive human mobility dataset in Australia by transforming available mobility data into a consistent format that is suitable for analysis in a broad range of research areas. Merging the various individual datasets into Australia's first comprehensive, national-scale human mobility data asset drastically improves the quality and coverage of existing datasets.\nThe Mobility Australia project received investment (https://doi.org/10.47486/DP702) from the Australian Research Data Commons (ARDC). The ARDC is funded by the National Collaborative Research Infrastructure Strategy (NCRIS).\nThe original data tables were structured in a matrix-like format. AURIN employed a methodology to merge diverse datasets into a comprehensive one, categorising based on transportation types (e.g., trains, buses, rails, ferries), years (e.g., 2019, 2020, 2021, etc.), and temporal scales (e.g., weekly, monthly, yearly). Subsequently, AURIN spatially enabled the original data by employing the 2021 edition of the Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS). The flow between origin and destination pairs is visually represented using line geometry.",

Photopoints are taken using the five point photo-point method. The set of images for usually consists of twenty images: four images taken at each corner of the plot facing each of the four cardinal points, and four images taken from the center of the plot facing each corner. \n\nThe site was established in 2010 in box woodland dominated by <em>Eucalyptus microcarpa</em> (grey box) and <em>Eucalyptus leucoxylon</em> (yellow gum). For additional site information, see https://www.tern.org.au/tern-observatory/tern-ecosystem-processes/whroo-dry-eucalypt-supersite/.\n\nOther images collected at the site include digital hemispherical photography, phenocam time-lapse images taken from fixed overstorey cameras and ancilliary images of fauna and flora.",

    "description": "This dataset provides daily measured streamflows into the four (4) major harvesting catchment dams in megalitres (ML). The streamflow is a calculated value which represents the observed 24-hour accumulated streamflow into the dam; net of any evaporation losses or rainfall gains from the dam surface. The streamflow measurement process requires reservior level, reservior gains and dam outflow data. The reservior level and dam outflow data is collected using telemetry devices. The reserviour levels are validated by Melbourne Water field operators. The dam outflow accounts for all water releases, including for consumption and for environmental purposes . The data is recorded at 8am daily. This data can be used in long and short-term catchment streamflow analysis.NOTE: Whilst every effort has been taken in collecting, validating and providing the attached data, Melbourne Water Corporation makes no representations or guarantees as to the accuracy or completeness of this data. Any person or group that uses this data does so at its own risk and should make their own assessment and investigations as to the suitability and/or application of the data.

    "description": "This dataset contains the processed Expendable Bathythermograph (XBT) data collected on Australia's Marine National Facility (MNF) RV Franklin and RV Southern Surveyor. XBT data typically comprises temperature and depth readings relayed to the surface at intervals of 0.1 seconds as the probe passes through the top few hundred metres of the ocean. This dataset has been QCed by the CSIRO Oceans & Atmosphere's (Formerly CSIRO Marine and Atmospheric Research) Ocean Observing Networks (OON) group. The data can be retrieved via CMAR Data Trawler, please see link below. The data is also available via the international National Oceanographic Data Center (NODC) Global Temperature-Salinity Profile Program (GTSPP) (Franklin platform code: 09FA and call sign: VJJF, Southern Surveyor platform code: 09SS and call sign: VLHJ) and Australian Ocean Data Network (AODN).\n\nThe subset extracted for MARVL contains data on the continental shelf as defined by the 200 metre depth contour from the 2012 Bathymetric dataset merged (spatial union) with the Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) in the Australian Maritime Boundary dataset (http://www.ga.gov.au/metadata-gateway/metadata/record/gcat_63565) available from Geosciences Australia (GA). This subset of the data contains 47 XBT station records from 15 voyages and includes temperature, pressure and salinity (derived) and spans from 1995 to the present. \n\nThe full data set is held in the O&A Information & Datacentre Data Warehouse, which currently holds over 724 XBT station records from more than 72 surveys collected since 1985.",

    "description": "Fine-scale mapping of vegetation, including Endangered Ecological\nCommunities (EECs) and Koala habitat across the Local Government Area (LGA). The mapping fulfills a fundamental requirement for the development of a Biodiversity Management Strategy (BMS) by Lismore City Council.\nThe LGA was divided into three zones, designated by colour, reflecting differing levels of available background information, potential for landuse to conflict with biodiversity objectives and other threats. NPWS Estate including National Parks (NPs), Nature Reserves (NRs) and State Conservation Areas (SCAs) as well as State Forests (SFs) were outside the scope of the mapping project.\nOriginal field work was undertaken between November 2010 and June 2011.  The mapping project commenced in Nov 2017 using 2009 aerial photography along with Sept 2012 imagery limited to the rural villages of Modanville, Dunoon and Nimbin. From May 2018 onwards the project used high resolution aerial photography taken in April 2018.\nVegetation was classified by API mainly on the basis of spatial patterns, texture and colour calibrated by field observations. Non-plantation vegetation polygons were assigned to vegetation units on the basis of canopy dominant species. Vegetation communities were placed in Keith formations and classes. Vegetation condition was also recorded.\nEach vegetation polygon was assigned to a Koala habitat category based only on flora species present.\nA list of EECs reported or considered likely to occur in the LGA were also derived.\nA reliability code was allocated to each mapped polygon, according to the source of the data and/or the manner in which data was collected.\nVIS_ID 4479",

    "description": "The purpose of this experiment was to quantitatively examine the rapid colour changes associated with the fiddler crab, Uca capricornis. Experiments were conducted in the East Point Reserve, Darwin from Nov - Jan (04/05 and 05/06). \n\n65 randomly selected crabs were caught (21 males and 44 females) and their ability to change colour over a 20 minute period was assessed using a portable spectrophotometer. \n\nThe results indicate that when caught, or otherwise stressed, U. capricornis are capable of rapidly changing their colour, with short term colour changes more likely in females. In all cases the pattern remained unchanged, but did become more difficult to distinguish as the colours darkened.",

An improved geocoding process has been introduced for this release. As such, previously released estimates for the 2010-11 and 2012-13 financial year have been superseded. The following personal income categories are provided in this census release:\n\n\nEmployee Income\n\n\nOwn Unincorporated Business Income\n\n\nInvestment Income\n\n\nSuperannuation Income\n\n\nOther Income (Income not allocatable to any other categories)\n\n\nTotal Income (Sum of previous categories)\nThese statistics provide insights into the nature of regional economies and the economic well-being of the people who live there. The data has been sourced from the Australian Taxation Office (ATO) and is presented with the updated 2016 editions of the Australian Statistical Geography Standards (ASGS):  Statistical Area Level 2 (SA2); Statistical Area Level 3 (SA3); Statistical Area Level 4 (SA4); Greater Capital City Statistical Area (GCCSA) and Local Government Area (LGA).\n\n\nFor more information on the release please visit the Australian Bureau of Statistics.\nPlease note:\n\n\nWhen interpreting these results, it should be noted that some low income earners, for example those receiving Government pensions and allowances, or those who earned below the tax free threshold, may not be present in the data, as they may not be required to lodge personal tax forms. Other individuals may not lodge a tax return even if required, therefore care should be taken in interpreting the data as well as comparing the data in this publication with other income data produced by the ABS.\n\n\nTo minimise the risk of identifying individuals in aggregate statistics, a confidentialisation process called perturbation has been applied to the data. Perturbation involves small random adjustment of the statistics and is considered the most satisfactory technique for avoiding the release of identifiable statistics while maximising the range of information that can be released.\n\n\nWhere data is not available or not for publication, the record has been set to a null value.\n\n",

Please note that most (if not all) CHM-based tree delineation results should be thought of as &quot;tree-approximate objects&quot;, and not actual trees. 2.

    "title": "ABS - Personal Income - Total Income Distribution (SA2) 2011-2012",
    "description": "This dataset presents information about total income distribution. The data covers the financial year of 2011-2012, and is based on Statistical Area Level 2 (SA2) according to the 2016 edition of the Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nTotal Income is the sum of all reported income derived from Employee income, Own unincorporated business, Superannuation, Investments and Other income. Total income does not include the non-lodger population.\nGovernment pensions, benefits or allowances are excluded from the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) income data and do not appear in Other income or Total income. Pension recipients can fall below the income threshold that necessitates them lodging a tax return, or they may only receive tax free pensions or allowances. Hence they will be missing from the personal income tax data set. Recent estimates from the ABS Survey of Income and Housing (which records Government pensions and allowances) suggest that this component can account for between 9% to 11% of Total income.\nAll monetary values are presented as gross pre-tax dollars, as far as possible. This means they reflect income before deductions and loses, and before any taxation or levies (e.g. the Medicare levy or the temporary budget repair levy) are applied. The amounts shown are nominal, they have not been adjusted for inflation. The income presented in this release has been categorised into income types, these categories have been devised by the ABS to closely align to ABS definitions of income.\nThe statistics in this release are compiled from the Linked Employer Employee Dataset (LEED), a cross-sectional database based on administrative data from the Australian taxation system. The LEED includes more than 120 million tax records over seven consecutive years between 2011-12 and 2017-18.\nPlease note:\n\n\nAll personal income tax statistics included in LEED were provided in de-identified form with no home address or date of birth. Addresses were coded to the ASGS and date of birth was converted to an age at 30 June of the reference year prior to data provision.\n\n\nTo minimise the risk of identifying individuals in aggregate statistics, perturbation has been applied to the statistics in this release. Perturbation involves small random adjustment of the statistics and is considered the most satisfactory technique for avoiding the release of identifiable statistics, while maximising the range of information that can be released. These adjustments have a negligible impact on the underlying pattern of the statistics. Some cells have also been suppressed due to low counts.\n\n\nTotals may not align with the sum of their components due to missing or unpublished information in the underlying data and perturbation.\n\n\nFor further information please visit the Australian Bureau of Statistics.\nAURIN has made the following changes to the original data:\n\n\nSpatially enabled the original data.\n\n\nSet 'np' (not published to protect the confidentiality of individuals or businesses) values to Null.\n\n",

The data shows the number of business establishments per city (CLUE) block, classified by their ANZSIC1 industry and small area allocation.

For more information about the processing levels, see <a href=\"https://github.com/OzFlux/PyFluxPro/wiki\">https://github.com/OzFlux/PyFluxPro/wiki</a>.\n \n The ecosystem was dominated by <em>Eucalyptus tectifica</em> and <em>Planchonia careya </em>.  Elevation of the site was close to 90m and mean annual precipitation at a nearby Bureau of Meteorology site was 1730mm. Maximum temperatures ranged from 31.4°C (in June) to 36.8°C (in October) while minimum temperatures range from 16.2°C (in July) to 25.1°C (in December). Maximum temperature varied seasonally by approximately 5.4°C and minimum temperatures varied by approximately 8.9°C.The instrument mast was 15 meters tall. Heat, water vapour and carbon dioxide measurements were taken using the open-path eddy flux technique. Temperature, humidity, wind speed, wind direction, rainfall, incoming and reflected shortwave radiation and net radiation were measured above the canopy. Soil heat fluxes are measured and soil moisture content was gathered using time domain reflectometry. ",

    "description": "The expected drag forces that the average sized limpets were exposed to in the high and low intertidal zones at Griffith Point, Victoria were estimated in a continuously circulating flow tank. The flow tank was 1.8m x 20.5cm x 19.5cm and had a maximum velocity of 0.5m/s. To adequately represent the water velocities found in the field, models of limpets that were 16 times the size of the average limpet for both the high and low zones were used. The large model limpets meant that the effects of drag in an effective flow environment of 8m/s could be measured, which were similar to velocities found in the field. Drag forces exerted on models of limpets that were 8 times the size of the shortest and tallest limpets from the high shore and the flattest limpets from the low shore limpets were also estimated.",

    "description": "This dataset presents information and locations related to The Super Tuesday Bike Count event in Katherine for 2019. The counts are presented as individual points which relate to the location where the counts were undertaken by volunteers.\nThe Super Tuesday Bike Count collects annual figures of bicycle riders and their movements on roads and bike paths. Since 2007, Bicycle Network has conducted bicycle counts at key intersections and corridors selected by local governments. The data is available for researchers and policymakers to plan and build cycling infrastructure to promote increased cycling activity, and to gather longitudinal insights of cycling volumes and trends.\nSuper Tuesday count data is collected visually by volunteer counters at intersections along popular commuter routes, as well as subsidiary routes with lower rider volumes. The count is conducted in southern states (VIC, NSW, SA, WA) between 7:00-9:00am on the first Tuesday of March; and in northern states (QLD, NT) between 6:30-8:30am on the first Tuesday of September. Count locations are nominated by traffic engineers, transport planners, and other transport officers from participating councils. Counters record all movement directions, rider gender, and bicycle volume per fifteen-minute increments on standardised count sheets. \nFor more information please visit the Norther Territory Government Open Data Portal or view the Bicycle Network Super Tuesday Count Report.\nPlease note: \n\nWhere there was no data available (\"no data\", \"NA\", \"#N/A\" in the original data) the values have been set to NULL.\n",

    "description": "This dataset is the 2016 release of the Victoria in Future series of data and presents Estimated Resident Population (ERP) by number of households and number of dwellings for the state of Victoria. The data is presented in 2015 Victoria in Future Small Area (VIFSA) boundaries and covers each fifth year for the years 2011 to 2031.\nThe Victoria in Future series is a projection of the ERP for Local Government Areas (LGA) and VIFSAs for 2011 to 2031. Some data areas are available for individual years and some for every fifth year in the projection period. The first year for each dataset in the series is 2011. Where available, the latest Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) data is used for the years 2012 to 2015.\nData are available for Estimated Resident Population (ERP - the official total population), population by age and sex (for single years of age in some cases, otherwise for five-year age groups), households and dwellings (including average household sizes and dwelling occupancy rates).\nVIFSAs are:\n\n\nsmaller than LGAs and fit entirely within them\n\n\nlarge enough to avoid the uncertainty attached to some projections at SA2 level\n\n\nas far as possible distinct from ABS classification, so as to avoid confusion and misinterpretations.\n\n\nVictoria in Future 2016 population projections are not predictions of the future, nor are they targets. They analyse changing economic and social structures and other drivers of demographic trends to indicate possible future populations if the present identified demographic and social trends continue. Projections are based exclusively on demographic components at the state and regional level, while local level projections take account of current and future land use, dwelling capacity, and development opportunities in addition to local demographic factors.\nFor more information please visit the DELWP VIF Portal.\nNotes: \n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data.\n\n\nThese detailed projections replace the projections published in Victoria in Future 2015 (based on the 2011 Census) issued by the Department of Transport, Planning and Local Infrastructure (DTPLI).\n\n\nThe base year for the calculation of VIF2016 projections is 2015 (as at 30 June), the most recent year for which the ABS has published the Estimated Resident Population (ERP) for both Victoria and for LGAs.\n\n\nThe data tables have been condensed to one dataset to allow longitudinal analysis of the data through year-period filters.\n\n",

    "description": "To support implementation of the extension to the Natural Heritage Trust, ERIN has compiled and maintains a national spatial database of all NRM regional boundaries. These boundaries provide the delivery and reporting framework for the regional component of the NHT. There are 56 NRM regions across Australia where funding is delivered.\n\nThe data has been compiled from State and Territory supplied regional boundaries to form a national dataset with consistent attribution. For a consistent national dataset, the Geoscience Australia 1:100,000 Coastline and State borders dataset was used in conjunction with the internal NRM region boundaries provided by the States.\n\nPlease note, from time to time States/Territories revise their regional boundaries in accordance with local legislation. It is envisaged that the boundaries will not change dramatically from those agreed under the bilateral agreements between the States/Territory and the Commonwealth however minor alterations will occur. The dataset is regularly updated to reflect these changes.CC - Attribution (CC BY)\nData to be available in the Public Domain under Creative Commons by Attribution Licensing Agreement.

    "description": "This dataset presents the footprint of the number and per cent of women who gave birth and attended 5 or more antenatal visits, by the mother's usual place of residence. The data spans the year of 2016 and is aggregated to Statistical Area Level 3 (SA3) geographic areas from the 2011 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nThe data is sourced from the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare (AIHW) National Perinatal Data Collection (NPDC). The NPDC began in 1991 and is a collaborative effort by the AIHW and state and territory health departments. Perinatal data are collected for each birth in each state and territory, usually by midwives and other birth attendants. The data are collated by the relevant state or territory health department and a standard de-identified extract is provided to the AIHW on an annual basis to form the NPDC. The NPDC covers both live births and stillbirths, where gestational age is at least 20 weeks or birth weight is at least 400 grams, except in Victoria and Western Australia, where births are included if gestational age is at least 20 weeks or, if gestation is unknown, birthweight is at least 400 grams.\nThe Mothers and Babies data accompanies the Australia's Mothers and Babies 2016 - In Brief Report.\nFor further information about this dataset, visit the data source: Australian Institute of Health and Welfare - Australia's Mothers and Babies 2016 Data Tables.\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data.\n\n\nWomen who gave birth at 32 weeks or more gestation to a livebirth or a stillbirth, with known number of antenatal visits (includes women with no antenatal care).\n\n\nSA3 is derived from Statistical Area Level 2 (SA2) of the ABS Australian Statistical Geography Standard Edition 2011.\n\n\nExcludes mothers not usually resident in Australia or whose SA2 of usual residence was 'Not stated'.\n\n",

    "title": "National Vegetation Information System (NVIS) Version 5.1 - AUSTRALIA - Estimated Pre-1750 Vegetation",
    "description": "CAUTION: NVIS datasets are large and computationally intensive! Please allow sufficient time to plan and execute any geoprocessing of NVIS datasets.\n\nThis dataset is a vector layer delineating the Pre-1750 ('pre-clearing', 'pre-European') native vegetation types across Australia made available for release under CC BY. This dataset is part of a larger compilation of Australian states and territories (with the exception of most of NSW and TAS which do not have pre-1750 data for this version) for the latest release (Version 5.1) of the National Vegetation Information System (NVIS). Each state/territory is available for separate download, due to size limitations.\n\nThis dataset comprises part of NVIS Version 5.0. This dataset was also used to develop previous Major Vegetation Groups and Subgroup products (version 3.0 to present). Note that the interpretation of vegetation descriptions (i.e. in the lookup table) may differ between versions. \n\nThe comparable estimated extant ('present') vegetation are in the following separate dataset(s):\nNVIS5_1_AUST_EXT_\n\nFeature classes are named - NVIS5_1_AUST_EXT_ or NVIS5_1_AUST_PRE_ .\n\nTo use this dataset and display the Level 1-6 hierarchy  the field \"NVISDSC1\" must be joined to the field \"NVIS_ID\" in the lookup table, available for separate:\nNVIS5_1_LUT_AUST_DETAILn > where n is an integer incremented with minor updates - see metadata for this table for instructions.\n\nOnce this table has been joined, a simple display option is to use the field \"MVG_NAME\" which includes the names of the NVIS Major Vegetation Groups (MVGs) as described at: http://www.environment.gov.au/land/publications/factsheets-vegetation-profiles-major-vegetation-groups. The most detailed account of the pre-clearing vegetation is in the field L6_SUB_ASSOCIATION following the NVIS scheme.\n[A legend or 'shadesets' for the MVGs and MVSs can be found \n\nFor internal users - N:\\Veg\\NVIS_V5_1_\\MVG_MVS\\Symbology\\Vector\n\nFor external users - in this package: \n- MVG5_1_BY_NAME.lyr\n- MVG5_1_BY_NUMBER.lyr\n- MVS5_1_BY_NAME.lyr\n- MVS5_1_BY_NUMBER.lyr\nUse the field “MVG_NUMBER/MVS_NUMBER” or “MVG_NAME/MVS_NAME” for the symbology.]\n\nThe NVIS vegetation attributes contain information on vegetation structure (growth form, height and cover) and floristics (genus and species) as documented in the Australian Native Vegetation Assessment (NLWRA, 2001) and the Australian Vegetation Attribute Manual Version 7.0 (NVIS Technical Working Group, 2017). Levels 1 to 6 of the NVIS Information Hierarchy are present in this dataset, where provided by the custodian.\n\nAttribute data for the above datasets marked \"Level 6\" were supplied in the XML Transfer System, which checks for consistency throughout the NVIS Information Hierarchy (NVIS Technical Working Group, 2017). Attribute data was loaded into an Oracle database at ERIN, where each vegetation type in the source data was allocated a unique NVIS identifier (NVIS_ID). Some attribute data, principally that coming from the Native Vegetation Mapping Program (NVMP), met the standard NVIS quality assurance tests.\n\nThe spatial data were supplied with SOURCE_CODEs, which were converted to NVIS identifiers (NVISDSC1-6). Please note that vegetation mapping can be quite complex and a single polygon may contain a \"mosaic\" of up to six vegetation associations. Other NVIS attributes were also updated on the basis of the supplied data.\n\nFor this update, Version 5.1, the extant dataset for Tasmania has been updated, with gapfilling work being completed for the NSW extant dataset. Some of the rulesets underpinning the assignment of MVGs and MVSs have also been updated to improve consistency for their allocation. Version 5.0 substantially standardised the lookup tables (NVIS5_1_LUT_DETAILxxxx and NVIS5_1_LUT_AUST_FLATxxxx). For more detail refer to the associate lookup tables. Previously, Version 4.2 updated NSW. For version 4.1 most agencies supplied data to the update.\n\nThis dataset is not comparable with earlier versions of NVIS, such as the 2001 Native Vegetation Assessment (which used a different structure and vegetation typology).\n\nReference:\nNVIS Technical Working Group (2017) Australian Vegetation Attribute Manual: National Vegetation Information System, Version 7.0.

    "description": "A gravity core (GC12) was collected from a depth of 990.5 mbsl within the Capricorn Channel, southern Great Barrier Reef (GBR). Samples were separated into different size fractions to determine the % of each grainsize at each sample depth. Although not overly accurate, the information is correlated with analyses of other parameters to impart clues to the environmental changes within the core. The smallest size fraction (<100µm) dominates at all depths, with an average of 95% in this size bracket at the base of the core. A peak in the larger grainsize fraction at 490cm is the result of a pteropod layer within the sediments. These pteropod accumulations are regular features within the cores. The exact reason for their occurence is unknown.",

    "description": "Borehole data is one of the key sources of information for conducting groundwater projects. This borehole data is composed of two primary components: construction (location, elevation, bore construction) and hydrogeologic (lithology, stratigraphy, aquifer, water level and chemistry) information.\nSince the development of recommended National reporting guidelines in Australia for registering boreholes, the completeness of borehole data has improved. Unfortunately, legacy borehole data is often incomplete, missing key pieces of information. A key legacy data gap is attributing aquifers to water sources in boreholes. Incomplete aquifer attribution information places limitations on the assessment of borehole data.\n\nBorehole aquifer attribution has historically been a time-consuming manual task requiring an investigator with the required level of knowledge to assess each bore. This manual task is influenced by numerous factors including the number and spatial distribution of boreholes, complexity of groundwater systems and geographical extent of the assessment area. Advancements in computing hardware, software and scripting environments offer the opportunity to automate this process.\n\nTools for automating borehole aquifer attribution have been developed using python script or FME (Feature Manipulation Engine) workflows. While these workflows follow the same general processing flow approach, they are customised to their respective assessment areas limiting broader application. To use these tools in other geographical areas would require customisation for each instance. Geoscience Australia have developed a prototype tool to standardise and streamline this process and deliver a consistent, repeatable method for attributing aquifers to borehole data to support groundwater projects under the Resourcing Australia’s Prosperity initiative.\n\nPresented at the 52nd Congress of International Association of Hydrogeologists (IAH2025)",

    "description": "Data collected as part of the City of Melbourne's Census of Land Use and Employment (CLUE). The data covers the period 2002-2023. It shows floor space (in square meters) per city (CLUE) block, classified by their CLUE industry (from ANZSIC1) and small area allocation. \n\nThe City of Melbourne creates unique codes to account for floor space allocated to residential space, vacant space, open space and common area. These unique codes are not included within ANZSIC 1 classification and therefore these floor areas are not included in this data set.\n\nThis data set has been confidentialised to protect the commercially sensitive information of individual businesses. Data in cells which pertain to two or fewer businesses have been suppressed and are shown as a blank cell. The row and column totals refer to the true total, including those suppressed cells.\n\nNon-confidentialised data may be made available subject to a data supply agreement.

    "description": "Taxation revenue is revenue received from the State’s taxpayers and includes payroll tax, land tax, duties levied principally on conveyances and land transfers, gambling taxes, insurance duty, fire services property levy, motor vehicle taxes and other taxes including congestion levy, metropolitan improvement levy and so on.\nThe State’s taxation revenue is forecast by a process that involves application of DTF’s economic forecasts, where there is a relationship between taxation revenue and economic variables; and use of forward indicators, unpublished revenue data and qualitative information from liaison with relevant stakeholders.\nThis enables an assessment of economic and other factors influencing the tax bases from which taxes are sourced e.g. for payroll tax, an assessment of the outlook for employment.\nWhere necessary, adjustment factors are used to account for other trends or events not captured by the model, such as impact of economic shocks or policy stimulus.",

When analysing these statistics, care needs to be taken as time periods, definitions, methodologies, scope and coverage can differ across collections. Where available, data have been presented as a time series - to enable users to assess changes over time. However, when looked at on a period to period basis, some series may sometimes appear volatile. When analysing the data, users are encouraged to consider the longer term behaviour of the series, where this extra information is available.\nFor more information please visit the Explanatory Notes.\nAURIN has made the following changes to the original data:\n\n\nSpatially enabled the original data with the ABS Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS) GCCSA 2016 dataset.\n\n\nSome data values in Data by Region have been randomly adjusted or suppressed to avoid the release of confidential details.\n\n\nWhere data was not available, not available for publication, nil or rounded to zero in the original data, it has been set to null.\n\n\nColumns and rows that did not contain any values in the original data have been removed.\n\n",

    "description": "This dataset presents aggregated values of Employee Income by Occupation and Sex as a category of the estimates of Personal Income for Small Areas ABS release. The data spans over the financial years of 2010-11 to 2014-15 and is aggregated to the 2016 Statistical Area Level 4 (SA4) boundaries.\nThis release presents regional data on the number of income earners, amounts they receive, and the distribution of income for the 2010-11 to 2014-15 financial years. An improved geocoding process has been introduced for this release. As such, previously released estimates for the 2010-11 and 2012-13 financial year have been superseded. The following personal income categories are provided in this census release:\n\n\nEmployee Income\n\n\nOwn Unincorporated Business Income\n\n\nInvestment Income\n\n\nSuperannuation Income\n\n\nOther Income (Income not allocatable to any other categories)\n\n\nTotal Income (Sum of previous categories)\nThese statistics provide insights into the nature of regional economies and the economic well-being of the people who live there. The data has been sourced from the Australian Taxation Office (ATO) and is presented with the updated 2016 editions of the Australian Statistical Geography Standards (ASGS):  Statistical Area Level 2 (SA2); Statistical Area Level 3 (SA3); Statistical Area Level 4 (SA4); Greater Capital City Statistical Area (GCCSA) and Local Government Area (LGA).\n\n\nFor more information on the release please visit the Australian Bureau of Statistics.\nPlease note:\n\n\nWhen interpreting these results, it should be noted that some low income earners, for example those receiving Government pensions and allowances, or those who earned below the tax free threshold, may not be present in the data, as they may not be required to lodge personal tax forms. Other individuals may not lodge a tax return even if required, therefore care should be taken in interpreting the data as well as comparing the data in this publication with other income data produced by the ABS.\n\n\nTo minimise the risk of identifying individuals in aggregate statistics, a confidentialisation process called perturbation has been applied to the data. Perturbation involves small random adjustment of the statistics and is considered the most satisfactory technique for avoiding the release of identifiable statistics while maximising the range of information that can be released.\n\n\nWhere data is not available or not for publication, the record has been set to a null value.\n\n",
