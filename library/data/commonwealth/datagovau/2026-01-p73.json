Counts are recorded from a representative part of the wetland and the proportion sampled is recorded.\r\n\r\nThe CEWH’s Flow-MER program examines the contribution of Commonwealth environmental water to the environmental objectives of the Basin Plan 2012 (Basin Plan) and is assisting the CEWH to demonstrate environmental outcomes and adaptively manage the water holdings. Monitoring and evaluation is focused in seven Selected Areas: the Junction of the Warrego and Darling rivers, Gwydir river system, Lachlan river system, Murrumbidgee river system, Edward/Kolety-Wakool river system, Goulburn River and Lower Murray River. \r\n\r\nThis Flow-MER data set includes and extends the long-term data collected at the same sites during the Long Term Intervention Monitoring (LTIM) project (2014-2019).\r\n\r\n###Acknowledgement\r\n\r\nThe Commonwealth Environmental Water Holder and Flow-MER program acknowledge the First Nations peoples as the Traditional Owners and Custodians of the lands, waterways and skies of the Murray-Darling Basin.

The data uses 2014 Non-ABS ASGS boundaries. \nThe NRP is designed for users interested in the socio-economic and environmental characteristics of regions - and in comparisons with similar geographies across Australia. Data are arranged under the broad themes/topics of Economy, Industry, People, and Energy and Environment. \nPlease note some data are not available for all reference years, for a variety of reasons. For example; there may be conceptual breaks in a data series; the collection frequency may be irregular; some series may have revisions pending; or permission to publish in the NRP may have only been granted recently. In addition, some data series are not available for the full range of geographies. The reasons can include: data owner or custodian preferences; industry identification with a few, particular geographies only; confidentiality protection; and the presence of many suppressed data cells (at smaller geographic levels) thus making true aggregations up to larger ASGS regions difficult. \nThis data is ABS data used with permission from the Australian Bureau of Statistics. Please note National Regional Profile (1379.0.55.001) has been discontinued. For the most recent regional data, please see Data By Region (1410.0). \nFor more information please visit the  Australian Bureau of Statistics.",

    "description": "This data was collected in October 2010 by the IMOS Ship of Opportunity Underway CO2 Measurement research group on MV L'Astrolabe (IMOS platform code: FHZI) voyage AL1011R0.\n\nDeparted:  Hobart Australia, October 21, 2010\nArrived:  \t Dumont d'Urville station, Antarctica, October 27, 2010\n\nCO2 System Overview:\nThe fugacity of carbon dioxide (fCO2) in surface seawater was measured using a General Oceanics Inc. automated system (Model 8050; Pierrot et al 2009). Seawater is sprayed into an equilibration chamber and CO2 in the headspace gas equilibrates with the seawater. The headspace gas is pumped through a thermoelectric condenser followed by a nafion drying tube, before flowing through a Licor 7000 non-dispersive infrared gas analyser used to measure the CO2 mole fraction (XCO2) of the dried air. The gas flow is stopped temporarily for the CO2 measurements, which are made at atmospheric pressure. A set of four CO2 standards (Table 1) that cover the range of CO2 values expected in the ocean are analysed about every three hours to calibrate the gas analyser. Atmospheric XCO2 (dry) is measured after the standards by pumping clean outside air from an intake on the forward mast of the ship. \n\nThe seawater intake is at about 3m depth in the bow of the ship. A remote temperature sensor (Seabird Electronics SBE38) located at the intake is used to measure sea surface temperature (SST). Sea surface salinity is measured using a thermosalinograph (Seabird Electronics SBE21) mounted in the bow thruster space near the intake. The travel time between the intake and CO2 system is typically about 50 seconds with warming usually less than 0.4ºC. The thermosalinograph water is from the same intake and supply line. Meteorological data, salinity, SST, and ships position and time are taken from the ship’s logging system. The salinity values measured by the SBE21 were checked against discrete bottle samples collected on the voyage.\n\nMeteorological data, salinity, SST, and ships position and time are taken from the ships logging system.",

    "description": "In 2011 AAM was commissioned by the Commonwealth to obtain orthophotography of Christmas Island. The survey was carried out using a fixed wing aircraft between the 24th and 26th of August 2011. All imagery was captured using a DiMAC UltraLight 50mmm Lens camera within approximately 2 hours of low tide. During this period tides ranged from\n0.5m to 1.2m. The photo frame and tide height table lists the approximate tide height for each raw photo. Using an automated process, raw images were joined to form a mosaic of the island. Colour balancing and replacement of certain areas with alternate raw images was performed for consistency. The imagery has a 15cm on ground resolution. \n\nThe orthophotography was provided to Geoscience Australia in GDA94. It has been converted to UTM WGS 84 zone 48s using ESRI ArcMap.\n\nAAM advised that the imagery is accurate to 30cm.\n\n<a href=\"https://www.infrastructure.gov.au/utilities/disclaimer.aspx\">Disclaimer</a>",

This dataset contains reports, data and metadata used in the flood study, and results data for the existing floodplain condition scenarios.  \n\nCouncil is committed to ensuring we have the latest flood modelling data to help manage flood risk in Brisbane. Flood studies provide Council with technical data to inform policy and for managing flooding within the Brisbane River and local creek and overland flow catchments.  \n\nThe Citywide Creek and Overland Flow Path Mapping Flood Study comprises a series of 27 individual sub-models which cover the entire Brisbane City Council area. Results data for flood height, depth and hazard (depth x velocity) are available for each individual sub-model for the 2, 5, 10, 20, 50, 100, 500 and 2000 year Average Recurrence Interval (ARI) storm events.   \n\nFor specific details on how the study was conducted, the areas it covers, and before using the data please read the flood study report. The flood study report, metadata used in the flood study and a detailed map that shows the 27 individual sub-models has also been made available in open data and is called <a href=\"https://data.brisbane.qld.gov.au/explore/dataset/flood-study-citywide-overland-flow-reference\">Flood Study — Citywide Overland Flow — reference</a>.  \n\nThe data on the table tab is the metadata relating to the data used for flood modelling in the Brisbane City Council Citywide Creek and Overland Flow Path Mapping Flood Study.   \n\nMore information on flood studies and how this information is used can be found on the <a href=\"https://www.brisbane.qld.gov.au/community-safety/community-safety/disasters-emergencies/be-prepared/flooding-brisbane/flood-strategy/flood-studies\">Brisbane City Council Website</a>.\nThe image below shows the 27 individual sub-models of the flood study and can be used to identify the sub-model for your location of interest.\n\n  ",

When compared to the 2010 coastline (1:30,000 data), and the 2011 orthophotography, the 2011 coastline follows the actual coast more accurately. To make the coastline, all the DEM pixels were reclassified using the ‘reclassify’ tool to give the value of zero, then the coastline was generated using the ‘raster to polygon tool’.\nNotes on other coast outlines:\nCadastre coastline: The coastline displayed as part of the cadastre is derived from the 1999 coastline, as well as some sections which have been manually surveyed.\n1999 coastline: A digital elevation model of Christmas Island was created in 1999 from which a coastline was created. This is presumed to be the basis of the 1:25,000 coastline and the original 1:30,000 coastline.\nDisclaimer",

At any given time data from all available satellites is included in the mapped and gridded data product. At times only data for TOPEX/Poseidon is available. This is indicated in one of the fields in the data file. Up to about mid-2003 the data is from TOPEX/Poseidon and ERS-1/2. The next generation of satellites (Jason-1 and Envisat) take over after that. The data is on a 1/3rd degree Mercator grid - the longitude grid spacing is always 1/3rd degree. The latitude grid spacing is 1/3rd of a degree at the equator, but gets smaller with distance from the equator. This data set is in a relatively easy to use format. The data was provided by Aviso/CNES in France and has been reformatted into a netCDF file at CSIRO Marine Research in Hobart.

The data has been calculated for each SA1 region region within the Greater Capital City regions following the 2016 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nThe VAMPIRE index is a research method developed at RMIT University's Centre for Urban Research (CUR) commissioned by AURIN. It assesses socio-economic oil price vulnerability in Australian cities based on an analysis of socio-economic indicators from the ABS. This technique has been successful in linking socio-economic data with an improved understanding of socio-spatial structure of vulnerability from rising transport and housing costs. Providing the VAMPIRE index in AURIN's existing data infrastructure will permit researchers and practitioners to access and evaluate VAMPIRE within their own local contexts.\nThe key (and only) dataset used to construct the VAMPIRE index is ABS census data for 2016. For each census year four Basic Community Profile (BCP) variables are used: (1) median household weekly income; (2) proportion of households owning two or more vehicles; (3) proportion of people traveling to work by car; and (4) number of homes being purchased with a mortgage.\nFor more information please view the Technical Documentation.",

    "description": "This report describes a program of simulated car crashes and examinations designed to evaluate the child restraints currently available in Australia. Each restraint was subjected to crash simulations producing deceleration forces equal to 17 times the weight of the occupant. During each crash, data such as harness forces, deceleration and velocity were recorded and high speed movies were provided. It was concluded that, in general, SAA-approved devices afforded a degree of protection adequate to ensure survival of the occupant in most real life frontal collisions; there were, however, some aspects of approved devices which could have been improved. In general, non-approved devices were considered inadequate, in at least some respects; some devices could easily be modified to satisfy safety requirements. The report concludes with detailed appraisals of 21 commercial products manufactured in Australia, Canada, Britain or the United States of America.\n\n<strong>Note:</strong> This resource was originally published on opengov.nsw.gov.au.

    "description": "This record describes, and links to a working paper published through the Economics and Environment Network at The Australian National University in Canberra.\r\n*****\r\nThe failures of traditional target-species management have led many to propose an ecosystem approach to fisheries to promote sustainability. The ecosystem approach is necessary, especially to account for fishery-ecosystem interactions, but by itself is not sufficient to address two important factors contributing to unsustainable fisheries - inappropriate incentives bearing on fishers, and the ineffective governance that frequently exists in commercial, developed fisheries managed primarily by total harvest limits and input-controls. We contend that much greater emphasis must be placed on fisher motivation when managing fisheries. Using evidence from more than a dozen ?natural experiments? in commercial fisheries, we argue that incentive-based approaches that better specify community, individual harvest, or territorial rights and also price ecosystem services - coupled with public research, monitoring and effective oversight - promote sustainable fisheries.",

The ULDO database enables the monitoring of current land development projects in addition to the identification of likely future residential, industrial and commercial land development across Perth and Peel.\nThe ULDO output covers Perth and Peel and includes:\n•   scheme amendments\n•   developer intentions\n•   structure planning in progress\n•   subdivision applications/approvals (Western Australian Planning Commission)\n•   local government development applications/approvals\n\nThe ULDO enables and supports existing planning policies by giving a spatial context to future land development over the short, medium and longer term. By identifying where future development will occur, the ULDO also supports other documents released by the WAPC. The 2016/17 release of the ULDO includes residential, special residential, special rural, industrial, commercial and tourism land uses. Within the residential land uses, the ULDO captures future fringe and infill development of five dwellings or more and single and multi-dwelling developments. \nThe ULDO seeks to provide a better understanding of the supply chain and the current status of various development initiatives to coordinate the supply and timely delivery of land to the Perth metropolitan and Peel regions.",

No data has changed.\r\n \r\nThis package of nationally consistent Australian spatial layers at one-kilometre resolution contains publicly available national data for use with MCAS-S up until December 2022. It replaces the 2014, 2011 and 2009 MCAS-S data packs. The downloadable zip file (1GB unzips to 4GB) contains a sample MCAS-S project alongside a data folder. Within the data folder are more than 290 layers in four sub-folders: Primary (raster data in GeoTIFF format for analysis) ~269 layers, Mask (raster data in GeoTIFF format for reporting and restricting the view) ~13 layers (note that categorical primary layers can now be used as masks by modifying the .tip file), Overlay (vector data in shapefile format – point, line, or polygons for context) ~17 layers, and Classified (empty folder for storage of layers created by using MCAS-S).\r\nThe layers in the Data pack are listed in the Microsoft Excel spreadsheet MCAS-S-datapack2022-contents.xlsx.\r\nFor instructions to use this data pack read the descriptive metadata.\r\n\r\nThis publication (and any material sourced from it) should be attributed as: ABARES 2022, Multi-Criteria Analysis Shell for\r\nSpatial Decision Support MCAS-S Data pack – update 2022, Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics and\r\nSciences, Canberra, December 2022 CC BY 4.0.

    "title": "Integrated Heat Vulnerability Index for Culturally and Linguistically Diverse (CALD) and Non-CALD Populations (2016)",
    "description": "This dataset provides a composite measure of heat vulnerability for Culturally and Linguistically Diverse (CALD) populations in Australia, integrating three key indicators: heat exposure, heat sensibility, and heat adaptive capability. Derived from social and environmental variables in CALD-specific AURIN datasets, it provides data for 2001, 2011, 2016, and 2021, utilising the 2021 SA1 boundaries to enable retrospective comparison. This framework allows for the assessment of heat vulnerability trends across diverse neighbourhoods, supporting targeted strategies for mitigating heat-related risks and fostering resilience and equity in urban environments.\nEffective Use Case Descriptions:\nHeat Vulnerability Assessment and Planning: Urban planners and environmental agencies can use the Integrated Heat Vulnerability Index to identify and prioritise CALD and non-CALD neighbourhoods most at risk from heat-related impacts. By analysing the index, they can develop targeted heat mitigation strategies such as enhancing green spaces, improving building insulation, or increasing access to cooling centres. This data-driven approach ensures resources are allocated effectively to areas with the highest vulnerability.\nPublic Health Interventions: Public health officials can utilise the heat vulnerability index to assess the risk of heat-related health issues in different neighbourhoods. By integrating indicators of heat exposure, sensibility, and adaptive capability, health agencies can design and implement targeted outreach programs, heat-health warnings, and community support initiatives to protect vulnerable populations during extreme heat events. \nClimate Adaptation Strategies: Climate resilience experts can apply the index to evaluate the effectiveness of past and current climate adaptation measures. By comparing heat vulnerability trends over time, they can identify gaps in adaptive capacity and recommend improvements to climate resilience strategies. This helps ensure that adaptation efforts are addressing the needs of the most affected communities. \nPolicy Development and Advocacy: Policymakers and advocacy groups can leverage the data to support evidence-based policy development and advocate for climate justice. The index provides a clear picture of how heat vulnerability varies across neighbourhoods, allowing for the formulation of policies that address inequities and promote inclusive urban planning. It can also be used to justify funding for heat mitigation and adaptation projects in vulnerable areas.\nCommunity Engagement and Education: Community organisations can use the heat vulnerability index to raise awareness about heat risks and promote community-driven solutions. By sharing insights on heat exposure and adaptive capabilities, these organisations can empower residents to participate in local heat resilience initiatives and advocate for improvements in their neighbourhoods. \nResearch and Academic Studies: Researchers can use the index to study the relationship between heat vulnerability and various socio-environmental factors. The longitudinal data enables analyses of how changes in urban development, demographic shifts, and climate change impact heat vulnerability over time, contributing to the broader understanding of environmental justice and urban resilience.",

    "title": "AIHW - Health Risk Factors - Adults who are Obese Crude (%) (PHN) 2011-2015",
    "description": "This dataset presents the footprint of the crude percentage of adults who are obese. Adults were classified as obese if their Body Mass Index (BMI) was greater than or equal to 30. As an indication of the accuracy of estimates, 95% confidence intervals were produced. These were calculated by the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) using standard error estimates of the proportion. The data spans the financial years of 2011-2012 and 2014-2015, and is aggregated to 2015 Department of Health Primary Health Network (PHN) areas, based on the 2011 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nHealth risk factors are attributes, characteristics or exposures that increase the likelihood of a person developing a disease or health disorder. Examples of health risk factors include risky alcohol consumption, physical inactivity and high blood pressure. High-quality information on health risk factors is important in providing an evidence base to inform health policy, program and service delivery.\nFor further information about this dataset, visit the data source: Australian Institute of Health and Welfare - Health Risk Factors in 2014-2015 Data Tables.\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data using the Department of Health - PHN Areas.\n\n\nThe health risks factors reported are known to vary with age and the different PHN area populations are known to have a range of age structures. As such, comparisons of results between the PHN areas should be made with caution because the crude rates presented do not account for these age differences.\n\n\nAdults are defined as persons aged 18 years and over.\n\n\nValues assigned to \"n.p.\" in the original data have been removed from the data.\n\n\nData for PHN701 (Northern Territory) should be interpreted with caution as the National Health Survey excluded discrete Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities and very remote areas, which comprise around 28% of the estimated resident population of the Northern Territory living in private dwellings.\n\n",

    "description": "This dataset presents the footprint of participation statistics in BreastScreen Australia for women ages 50 to 74, by age group. The national breast cancer screening program, BreastScreen Australia began in 1991. It aims to reduce illness and death from breast cancer using screening mammography for early detection of unsuspected breast cancer in women. The data spans the years of 2014-2016 and is aggregated to Statistical Area Level 3 (SA3) geographic boundaries from the 2011 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nCancer is one of the leading causes of illness and death in Australia. Cancer screening programs aim to reduce the impact of selected cancers by facilitating early detection, intervention and treatment. Australia has three cancer screening programs:\n\n\nBreastScreen Australia\n\n\nNational Cervical Screening Program (NCSP)\n\n\nNational Bowel Cancer Screening Program (NBCSP)\n\n\nThe National cancer screening programs participation data presents the latest cancer screening participation rates and trends for Australia's 3 national cancer screening programs. The data has been sourced from the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare (AIHW) analysis of National Bowel Cancer Screening Program register data, state and territory BreastScreen Australia register data and state and territory cervical screening register data.\nFor further information about this dataset, visit the data source:Australian Institute of Health and Welfare - National Cancer Screening Programs Participation Data Tables.\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data.\n\n\nParticipation rates represent the percentage of women in the population aged 50-74 screened by BreastScreen Australia over 2 calendar years. The population denominator was the average of the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) Estimated Resident Population (ERP) for females aged 50-74 within the relevant geographical area for the relevant 2-year reporting period.\n\n\nAn SA3 was assigned to women using a postcode to SA3 correspondence. Because these are based only on postcode, these data will be less accurate than those published by individual states and territories.\n\n\nSome postcodes (and hence women) cannot be attributed to an SA3 and therefore these women were excluded from the analysis. This is most noticeable in the Northern Territory but affects all states and territories to some degree.\n\n\nSA3s with a numerator less than 20 or a denominator less than 100 have been suppressed.\n\n\nSA3 data for the Blue Mountains - South, Christmas Island, Cocos (Keeling) Islands, Cotter - Namadgi, Fyshwick - Piallago - Hume, Illawarra Catchment Reserve, Jervis Bay, and Lord Howe Island were excluded due to reliability concerns from low numbers in these regions.\n\n\nTotals may not sum due to rounding.\n\n\nBreastScreen Australia changed its target age group from 50-69 years to 50-74 years from July 2013; participation is reported for both the previous and current target age groups to allow comparison of trends with previously reported data.\n\n\nData are preliminary and subject to change.\n\n\nThe 2014-2015 period covers 1 January 2014 to 31 December 2015, and the the 2015-2016 period covers 1 January 2015 to 31 December 2016.\n\n",

    "description": "A survey of the east Tasmanian coastline from Musselroe Bay to South East Cape revealed a total of 10 km2 of Macrocystis pyrifera (Linnaeus) C. Agardh 1820 kelp forest. Average harvestable quantities based on Alginates (Australia) Company records (1965-72) show that cropping can expect to yield 5 ton/acre or 1.23 kg/m2. This realizes a total of 12,300 tonne available on the East Coast of Tasmania in 1986. Review of past records show fluctuations in total amounts harvested, due possibly to factors such as high oceanic water temperatures with subsequent low nutrient concentrations and storm damage.\nThe survey was conducted from a light aeroplane. Areas of Macrocystis pyrifera beds were marked on 1:100,000 topographical land tenure maps using landmarks as references. Digitising of bed outlines on maps was done using Mapinfo.\nWeight of Macrocystis per unit area is also estimated from quadrats harvested at a number of sites along the coast.",

    "description": "By quantifying the length of time after fire for obligate-seeding plant species to become reproductively mature (the juvenile period), the risk of population decline under specific fire intervals can be delineated to inform local fire and conservation management. In this project, juvenile period data for serotinous obligate-seeder taxa across south-west Australia were collated from several studies. Linear models were then developed to estimate juvenile period based on measures of environmental productivity. These models were then spatially projected to the classic and drier Mediterranean agro-climatic class areas (Hutchinson et al. 2005) within south-west Australia.\n1.

Overlay maps may apply to all or part of your property and your property may be affected by more than one overlay. Having an overlay on your property will only affect you if you intend to develop (i.e. extent or build, change use, subdivide, clear native vegetation, fill or excavate). \nThe attribute fields are defined as per Qld Planning Provisions, Schedule 2.

    "description": "The NSW Post-School Destinations and Experiences Survey (PSDES) collects information about the main destinations of recent school leavers in the 6 to 12 months after leaving school.\nData Notes\n\n\nThe survey collected data on school leavers in the 6-12 months after leaving school in 2023, School leavers comprise students who completed Year 12 and students who left school while they were in Year 10, 11 or 12 (early school leavers).\n\n\nThere are some caveats and limitations in the generalisability of survey findings to the total population of recent school leavers in NSW. For example, students who completed Year 12 via an alternative pathway other than the HSC, such as the International Baccalaureate, are not counted as Year 12 completers and are not covered in the survey.\n\n\nPrior to 2021 a stratified sampling approach was used for the mainstream Year 12 completer survey (excluding Aboriginal and/or Torres Strait Islander and non-Connected Community school leavers). The sampling strategy for this group changed to a census for the first time in 2021 and resulted in a marked increase in the overall proportion of responses collected from the target population.\n\n\nTime series data of destinations by student type from 2014 to 2018 should be used with caution as some counts of school leavers are estimated from lower cell counts than in later years. Estimates in the data are based on base weights which are adjusted to matched population distributions for school leaver characteristics to minimise non-response bias.\n\n\nEach table shows population estimates (as column totals) for each grouping variable and leaver type combination as well as weighted percentages for each of the 10 main destination categories included in the survey. Population estimates and destination percentage breakdowns are also included for all leavers (across leaver type). Findings are reported at a system level (across leavers from government and non-government schools).\n\n\nFor a full description of notes and caveats, see the 2023 Post-School Destinations and Experiences Survey Technical Report\n\n\nSee the 2023 Post-School Destinations and Experiences Survey, Annual Report and fact sheets\n\n\nData Source\nNSW Post-School Destinations and Experiences Survey\nAvailable tables in this dataset:\n\nTable 1 provides a breakdown of main destination by leaver type and survey year (2014 to 2023).\nTable 2 provides a breakdown of main destination by leaver type and gender (as self-identified) for 2023 only.\nTable 3 provides a breakdown of main destination by leaver type and Aboriginal status (as self-identified) for 2023 only.\n",

These sites have been identified as requiring to be upgraded from their current standard to cater for larger fire vehicles. These works have been identified in the RFMP 2019-28. \nThe symbology is determined by the 'Required_Works' field. The current values are 'Proposed Light Unit', 'Proposed Walking Track', 'Upgraded Rigid Float'.\nProposed Light Unit  - To allow the safe passage of light units (4x4 Landcruiser or similar carrying a water tank of 400 – 600 litres). Generally, these features will have a width of 3 metres of natural, grass, sealed or gravel surface, corners of sufficient radius to make 3-point turns by light units unnecessary.\nProposed Walking Track - Allow the safe passage of fire fighters on foot. Generally, these features will be less than 1m in width, of natural, grass, sealed or gravel surface and with vegetation maintained to allow single-file walking.\nUpgraded Rigid Float - To allow the safe passage of a rigid body truck carrying a D4 or equivalent sized bulldozer or machinery. Generally, these features will have the same characteristics as tanker roads but will have smaller rollovers and no switchback corners.",

    "description": "This dataset consists of measurements of the exchange of energy and mass between the surface and the atmospheric boundary-layer in open-forest savanna using eddy covariance techniques. Located in a 5 square kilometre block of relatively uniform open-forest savanna, the site is representative of high rainfall, frequently burnt tropical savanna. Tropical savanna in Australia occupies 1.9 million square km across the north and given the extent of this biome, understanding biogeochemical cycles, impacts of fire on sequestration, vegetation and fauna is a national priority. In the NT, savanna ecosystems are largely intact in terms of tree cover, with only modest levels of land use change. Despite this, there is evidence of a loss of biodiversity, most likely due to shifts in fire regimes and a loss of patchiness in the landscape. Approximately 40% of the savanna burn every year and understanding fire impacts on fauna and flora is essential for effective land management.

    "description": "This dataset presents the Spatial Network Analysis for Multimodal Urban Transport Systems (SNAMUTS) indicators by activity node locations for the year of 2021.\nSNAMUTS Australia is a multiple indicator tool to assess public transport network performance and land use-transport integration in Australia's five largest metropolitan areas (Adelaide, Brisbane, Melbourne, Perth, Sydney), at SA1 level and for specified activity nodes in the census years 2011, 2016 and 2021. SNAMUTS is a decision-making support tool designed to inform strategies for public transport infrastructure and service improvements, land use intensification and overall metropolitan strategic planning. It also allows for timeline and city-to-city comparisons on public transport performance and accessibility indicators between about 30 cities on four continents.\nSNAMUTS has been developed and refined with funding from the Australian Research Council (DP110104884), the European Science Foundation (COST TU1002), the Cities of Melbourne, Manningham and Perth, internal support through RMIT University, Curtin University and University of Melbourne, the Sustainable Built Environment National Research Centre (SBENRC), AURIN and in-kind support by the University of Porto, Goudappel Coffeng, University of Amsterdam, University of Gothenburg, Norwegian University of Life Sciences, Western Norway University of Applied Sciences, Concordia University and University of Westminster.\nThese are known as the eight key SNAMUTS indicators, they include:\n- Transfer intensity (degree centrality)\n- Ease of movement (closeness centrality),\n- Geographical reach of public transport journeys (30-minute contour catchment)\n- Spatial concentration of public transport journey paths (betweenness centrality and transfer propensity)\n- Flexibility of movement (nodal connectivity) \n- Future-proofness of the network (nodal resilience)\n- A composite index for overall public transport accessibility. \nIt is based on public transport network and timetable information available publicly through transport agencies (Adelaide Metro, Translink, PTV, Transperth, TfNSW) and ABS census data (usual residential population and journey-to-work destinations) for the three years (2011, 2016, 2021). This data can be viewed in conjunction with the corresponding routes dataset: \"SNAMUTS - Route Segment (Polyline) 2021\".\nFor more information, please refer to the SNAMUTS website.

    "description": "This dataset presents final estimates for the water usage of agricultural businesses in Australia by Statistical Area Level 2 (SA2) from the 2015-16 Agricultural Census. Categories included are statistics on water use, water sources, irrigation expenditure and irrigation methods. Data is aggregated to 2011 ASGS SA2 boundaries.\nThe Agricultural Census is conducted once every five years. The scope of the 2015-16 Agricultural Census was all businesses undertaking agricultural activity recorded on the Australian Bureau of Statistics’ Business Register (ABSBR) above a minimum threshold applied to the estimated value of their agricultural operations. The threshold for the 2015-16 Agricultural Census was all agricultural businesses with an Estimated Value of Agricultural Operations (EVAO) of $40,000 or greater. This is a change from previous ABS Rural Environment and Agricultural Collections, where a  EVAO threshold of $5,000 or greater was used. As a result of the change in scope, the estimates from the 2015-16 Agricultural Census will not be directly comparable to previously published Agricultural Censuses or annual Rural Environment and Agricultural Commodity Survey outputs. The 2015-16 Census final estimates are based on the achieved target response rate of 85% from an in-scope population of approximately 103,400 agricultural businesses. \nThe estimates in this dataset are based on information obtained from agricultural businesses that responded to the 2015-16 Agricultural Census. However, since not all of the businesses that were selected provided data, the estimates are subject to sampling variability; that is, they may differ from the figures that would have been produced if information had been collected from all businesses. Most published estimates have relative standard errors (RSEs) less than 10%. For some states and territories with limited production of certain commodities, RSEs are greater than 10%. Estimates with an RSE greater than 50% are considered too unreliable for general use and hence have been removed from the data.\nThis data is ABS data (catalogue number: 4618.0) used with permission from the Australian Bureau of Statistics.\nFor more information on the dataset please visit the Australian Bureau of Statistics.\nPlease note: \n\n\nEstimates with an RSE value greater than 50% and are considered too unreliable for general use and have been removed from the data\n\n\nWhere data was not published or not applicable the records have been set to null\n\n",

Reports relating to deaths were compiled by police officers and forwarded to the coroner, who decided whether an inquest was necessary.\nThis dataset was created from an index of those reports of deaths about which an inquest was held, corrected and enhanced in 2021. The reports include name or surname and given names of the deceased, location of death, a note of other details (i.e. cause of death, date of death, age at death, occupation, etc.), and the date and page of gazette in which it was reported, and the citation of any other published resources consulted.\nSearch the index at the State Library of Queensland in the Family History Indexes on One Search, the library catalogue: http://onesearch.slq.qld.gov.au/",

    "description": "Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are millisecond-duration radio bursts of extragalactic origin. Since the discovery of the first FRB in the archival Parkes/Murriyang multibeam data, a broad dichotomy in population has emerged. Some FRBs have been seen to be repeating, while others are not, despite a significant amount of follow-up using different radio telescopes. The repeating FRB 20240114A was recently discovered by CHIME/FRB, which has been seen to have an exceptionally high burst activity. Such extreme burst activity has not been seen in any other source. The repeating FRBs, such as FRB 20240114A, provide an unparalleled window into their circumburst environment due to their repeating nature, which can be used to constrain possible progenitor models and test underlying emission mechanisms. The previous Parkes/Murriyang source follow-up has also revealed intriguing spectro-polarimetric properties, such as frequency-dependent evolution of burst central frequency or chromaticity, a possible activity window, significantly large circular polarisation (CP), and frequency-dependent CP. These properties hold the key towards understanding the circumburst environment of the FRBs, and test possible progenitor models. A large bandwidth instrument with reliable polarimetry has been critical in uncovering these properties. The ultra-wideband low (UWL) receiver on Parkes/Murriyang is ideally suited to explore the source's wideband spectro-temporal and polarimetric behaviour. We propose a campaign to regularly follow up FRB 20240114A to ascertain its long-term evolution of spectro-temporal properties.",

    "description": "The 1991 Census Expanded Community Profiles present 44 tables comprising more detailed information than that of the basic community profiles which provide characteristics of persons and/or dwellings for Statistical Local Areas (SLA) in Australia. \nThis table contains data relating to nature of occupancy by landlord type by annual family income by family type. Counts are of families living in occupied private dwellings (a) (excludes caravans etc in caravan parks), based on place of enumeration on census night which; includes overseas visitors; excludes Australians overseas; and excludes adjustment for under-enumeration. The data is by SLA 1991 boundaries. Periodicity: 5-Yearly. \nThis data is ABS data (cat. no. 2101.0 &amp; original geographic boundary cat. no. 1261.0.30.001) used with permission from the Australian Bureau of Statistics. The tabular data was processed and supplied to AURIN by the Australian Data Archives. The cleaned, high resolution 1991 geographic boundaries are available from data.gov.au.\nFor more information please refer to the 1991 Census Dictionary.\nPlease note:\n\n\n(a) Nature of occupancy is a dwelling characteristic. In multiple family households, each family has the same nature of occupancy.\n\n\n(b) Comprises families where at least care, but not all, member(s) aged 15 years or more did not state an income and/or at least one spouse or offspring was temporarily absent.\n\n\n(c) Comprises families where no member present stated an Income.\n\n\n(d) Comprises 'other/inadequately described' and 'not stated'.\n\n",

    "title": "Privatising fish? Barriers to the use of marine protected areas for conservation and fishery management in Melanesia: WORKING PAPER",
    "description": "This record describes, and links to a working paper produced through the Resource Management in Asia-Pacific (RMAP) Program based at The Australian National University in Canberra.\n*****\nIn this paper we examine the strengths and weaknesses of state-supported Customary Marine Tenure (CMT) systems in two independent Melanesian states in the context of burgeoning commercial and subsistence fisheries. Both Papua New Guinea and Solomon Islands can be categorised as 'weak states' where access by foreign-owned fishing companies to state-owned resources (e.g. tuna) is typically easy to obtain by bribing the relevant politicians and bureaucrats at national and/or provincial level. By contrast, access to near-shore fishery resources necessitates negotiation with the landowners of adjacent coastal zones, and this in itself can provide some level of resource protection. However the expansion of markets and rapid increases in populations in the region are exerting pressures on subsistence and commercial fisheries that are already creating significant problems. In the Solomon Islands the recent collapse of the state in a militia coup has also meant that any escalation in marine resource piracy is likely to proceed unchecked and indeed in many cases unnoticed and unreported. The management tool of choice for multi-species fisheries across the world, and particularly in cash-poor developing countries is the Marine Protected Area (MPA), and this system has proved quite successful in many instances, particularly in rich, industrialised countries. However, with some exceptions, typical Melanesian CMT regimes make MPAs difficult to establish because many coastal zones are finely divided along clan boundaries, such that few clans would be willing to 'lock up' their own reefs for the benefit of neighbouring clans. How then can local communities in these countries most effectively manage their marine resources in an environment of escalating fishing pressure and weak governance? In this essay we analyse the social and institutional contexts of near-shore community-based fishery resource management, and explore options for the future. We look at the potential utility of educating reef owners about aspects of the life cycle of marine organisms that are mostly absent from local knowledge systems and how this information could empower villagers to better formulate their own management regimes.",
