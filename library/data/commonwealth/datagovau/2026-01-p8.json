    "description": "Financial and staff resourcing data supplied by Commonwealth, State and Territory park agencies 2012-16.\r\n\r\nAgencies contacted for inclusion included:\r\n\r\n- Director of National Parks (Commonwealth),\r\n\r\n- Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority (GBRMPA - Commonwealth),\r\n\r\n- ACT Environment and Planning / Parks and Conservation,\r\n\r\n- NSW National Parks and Wildlife Service (Office of Environment and Heritage),\r\n\r\n- Parks and Wildlife Commission of Northern Territory,\r\n\r\n- Department of National Parks, Sport and Racing (Queensland),\r\n\r\n- Department of Environment, Water and Natural Resources (SA),\r\n\r\n- Parks and Wildlife Service (Tasmania),\r\n\r\n- Parks Victoria,\r\n\r\n- Department of Parks and Wildlife (WA).\r\n\r\nNotes and caveats of Parks agency data:\r\n\r\nNote that some agencies represented here underwent significant structural change during the period and data was either unavailable or year to year data are not readily comparable between years.\r\n\r\n* Commonwealth - Director of National Parks\r\n\r\nThe staffing figure for 2013-14 and 2014-15 includes all Commonwealth Marine Reserve Branch who were transferred to the DNP in 2013-14. Prior to this a smaller number was reported.\r\n\r\nThe figures (in millions) for all years are the total operating expenditure. The figures exclude governance, corporate services and executive costs. The figures exclude governance, corporate services and executive costs.\r\n\r\nData was not provided for the details of external funding, research funding or conservation project funding.\r\n\r\n* Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority\r\n\r\nBudget data provided as ‘Total cash received’ from and cross-checked to annual reports.\r\n\r\n* Australian Capital Territory - ACT Territory and Municipal Services / Parks and Territory Services / Parks and Conservation\r\n\r\nData was not provided for the details of research funding or conservation project funding.\r\n\r\n* New South Wales - National Parks and Wildlife Service\r\n\r\nStaff figures provided were sourced from Budget Paper 3 reporting\r\n\r\nNote that research for NPWS is conducted by Science Division of OEH so amount of money spent on research in or for NPWS is not included here.\r\n\r\n* Northern Territory - Parks and Wildlife Commission of Northern Territory\r\n\r\nSourced from annual reports, data not provided. Due to complexities outlined below, data is not readily comparable from year to year. The Commission was re-established as a stand-alone agency in September 2012 following a government restructure. The former Department of Natural Resources, Environment, the Arts and Sport (NRETAS) has been dispersed into the following agencies:\r\n- Parks and Wildlife Commission of the Northern Territory\r\n- Department of Land Resource Management\r\n- Department of Arts and Museums\r\n- Department of Sport and Recreation.\r\n- Parks and Wildlife came from the Output Group: Protected Areas and Conservation\r\n- Figures exclude the Territory Wildlife Parks Government Business Division\r\nData was not available for 2011-12 and 2015-16\r\n\r\n* Queensland – Queensland Parks and Wildlife Service\r\n\r\nStaff and funding data is for FTEs employed within the Queensland Parks and Wildlife Service only (does not include Wildlife officers or rangers managing wildlife off-park, and does not include staff managing Nature Refuges programs)\r\n\r\nData for 2015-16 is point in time only (19 Feb 2016) and will change.\r\n\r\nQPWS does not record or report on a category of 'external staff' involved in reserve conservation and management.\r\n\r\nTo maintain consistency from year to year, Budget Figures are those provided for by the Government as documented in the State Budget (Service Delivery Statements) for the relevant financial year - actual funding and expenditure will vary from this.\r\n\r\nThe Queensland Parks and Wildlife Service underwent Machinery of Government changes in May 2012 and comparative financial data is not available for 2011-12.\r\n\r\n* South Australia - Department of Environment, Water and Natural Resources\r\n\r\nData for 2015-16 was not provided...\r\n\r\n* Tasmania - Parks and Wildlife Service\r\n\r\nData was not provided for the details of research funding or conservation project funding.\r\n\r\n* Victoria - Parks Victoria\r\n\r\nAnnual budget is provided for 2011-12 to 2015-16  – from ‘total expenses from transactions’  within Annual Comprehensive Operating Statements)\r\n\r\nExternal funding is given as ‘funding from Non-State Government entities’\r\n\r\n* WA - Department of Environmental Regulation and Department of Parks and Wildlife\r\n\r\nData was not provided for staffing and budgets, and an attempt was made to source from annual reports. Due to complexities outlined below, data is not readily comparable from year to year or retrievable from annual reports in a suitable format.\r\n\r\nDepartment of Parks and Wildlife (Parks and Wildlife) was created as a new agency, following the separation of the former Department of Environment and Conservation (DEC) into two departments. The continuing agency, renamed the Department of Parks and Wildlife (Parks and Wildlife), has had the responsibility of providing bureau services to the Department in the areas of information and communication technology, human resources management, financial management, and recordkeeping. The Parks and Visitor Services, Nature Conservation and Sustainable Forest Management services of DEC became part of DPaW, while the Environmental Regulation and Environmental Sustainability and Climate Change services of DEC became part of DER. Legislative responsibilities and administration have changed following  amendments to the Conservation and Land Management Act  2015.\r\n\r\nFigure HER20, HER 21 and HER30 in heritage theme.\r\nhttps://soe.environment.gov.au/theme/heritage/topic/2016/inputs-financial-resources#heritage-figure-HER20\r\n\r\nhttps://soe.environment.gov.au/theme/heritage/topic/2016/inputs-financial-resources#heritage-figure-HER21\r\n\r\nhttps://soe.environment.gov.au/theme/heritage/topic/2016/inputs-human-resources#heritage-figure-HER30",

Young anemometer and YSI barometer was set up near Governor Head, Jervis Bay (35.133S, 150.762E). The site was several hundred metres inland of 50m high cliffs and was 63m above sea-level.\n\nBetween 3nd Nov 1989 and 24th September 1991 the station recorded wind velocity, direction (E/W and N/S components) and atmospheric pressure. \n\nThe Meteorological Station recorded 15 minute vector averages of the wind velocity and 15 minute values of air pressure. Data is presented in the oceanographic format i.e. 'direction going to'. The datasets titled 'Additional meteorological data' provide information on the average wind speed and direction, as well as the maximum gusts.\n\nThis is one of thirty-six child records that relate to the parent, 629051e0-2b7b-11dd-a343-00188b4c0af8. A pdf outlining the structure and hierarchy of metadata records relating to the 'Jervis Bay Baseline Studies' project is available to download through this record.

Data were processed using PyFluxPro (v3.4.17) as described by Isaac et al. (2017). PyFluxPro produces a final, gap-filled product with Net Ecosystem Exchange (NEE) partitioned into Gross Primary Productivity (GPP) and Ecosystem Respiration (ER).\n\nThe Gatum Pasture flux station, established in February 2015, was located on private farmland in southwestern Victoria, approximately 300&nbsp;km west of Melbourne. The pasture is composed of winter-active perennial grasses (<em>Phalaris aquatica</em> L. and <em>Trifolium subteraneum</em> L.) and is used for sheep and, sporadically, cattle grazing.",

    "description": "This data was collected in December 2012 - January 2013 by the IMOS Ship of Opportunity Underway CO2 Measurement research group on RV Aurora Australis (IMOS platform code: VNAA) voyage AA1213V2.\n\nDeparted: \tHobart, Tasmania, December 20, 2012\nArrived:  Hobart, Tasmania,  January 08, 2013\n\nCO2 System Overview:\nThe fugacity of carbon dioxide (fCO2) in surface seawater was measured using a General Oceanics Inc. automated system (Model 8050; Pierrot et al 2009). Seawater is sprayed into an equilibration chamber and CO2 in the headspace gas equilibrates with the seawater. The headspace gas is pumped through a thermoelectric condenser followed by a nafion drying tube before flowing through a Licor 7000 non-dispersive infrared gas analyser used to measure the CO2 mole fraction (XCO2) of the dried air. The gas flow is stopped temporarily for the CO2 measurements, which are made at atmospheric pressure. A set of four CO2 standards that cover the range of CO2 values expected in the ocean are analysed about every three hours to calibrate the gas analyser.  Atmospheric XCO2 (dry) is measured after the standards by pumping clean outside air from an intake on the forward mast of the ship. \n\nSeawater intake and ancillary data:\nThe seawater intake is at about 6 m depth. A remote temperature sensor (Seabird Electronics SBE38) located at the intake is used to measure sea surface temperature (SST). Sea surface salinity is measured using a thermosalinograph (Seabird Electronics SBE21) mounted in the oceanographic lab next to the pCO2 system. The travel time between the intake and CO2 system is typically about 70 seconds with warming usually less than 0.7ºC in cold waters near freezing. The thermosalinograph water is from the same intake and supply line. \n\nMeteorological data, salinity, SST, and ships position and time are taken from the ship’s logging system.",

    "description": "The operational map for Coastal Saltmarsh was constructed to resolve long-standing issues surrounding its identification, location and extent within the NSW State Forest estate covered by the eastern Regional Forest Agreements. The project’s Threatened Ecological Community Reference Panel (the Panel) reviewed the determination for Coastal Saltmarsh and agreed upon a set of diagnostic parameters for its identification. \nWe identified that any treeless saline and sub saline native vegetation found in the intertidal zone had the potential to be Coastal Saltmarsh. We estimated the extent of the intertidal zone by using a fine scale digital elevation model to determine the highest astronomical tideline (HAT). We then mapped potential Coastal Saltmarsh by analysing recent fine scale three dimensional aerial imagery to identify any native vegetation that comprised of low-growing treeless communities and was located within the HAT and on the landward side of mangroves. Mapping criteria used a tree cover tolerance of up to 30% to include areas that had a mixed cover of mangrove, paperbark or casuarina species with a saltmarsh understorey. Exposed mudflats and banks were also mapped when they were visible.\nOur mapping covered 1.4 million hectares of State Forest within the south, central and north coast regions of NSW. We identified a total of 111.9 hectares of Coastal Saltmarsh within 14 State Forests along the east coast. The most extensive areas are located in Bermagui and Mogo State Forests on the south coast and in Wallaroo State Forests on the north coast. \nWe validated our map of coastal saltmarsh using an existing independent map of estuarine habitats (Creese et al 2009). Our mapping consistently identified almost twice as much coastal saltmarsh as Creese et al (2009), but this was attributable to differences in the mapping criteria rather than any error.\nOperational TEC Mapping have been derived by API at a viewing scale between 1-4000 using ADS40 50 cm pixel imagery and 1 m derived LIDAR DEM grids for floodplain EECs.",

    "description": "Data and charts for figures of CSIRO's 'Modelling Sectoral Technology and Emissions Pathways to 2035 and Net Zero Emissions - Final Report'\n\nTo assist the Australian Government in developing a national net zero emissions by 2050 plan, the parliament requested that the Climate Change Authority undertake a review of the potential technology transition and emissions pathways in six sectors – electricity and energy, industry and resources, transport, land and agriculture, waste, and the built environment.\n\nThe six modelling scenarios analysed in this report were designed by the authority in consultation with CSIRO. The modelling undertaken by CSIRO examined six scenarios reflecting four levels of domestic decarbonisation ambition (A50, A45, A40, A35) with net-zero years ranging from 2050 to 2035, each with a corresponding level of emissions in 2035 as indicated in Table 1. The domestic scenarios were modelled under different global climate ambition settings of 2°C and 1.5°C (G2 and G1.5) to explore the macroeconomic, sectoral and environmental impact for Australia with different combinations of domestic and global ambition. Two additional sensitivity scenarios were modelled to investigate the impact of lower renewable uptake and are implemented as an upper limit (the “+RL” or “+Renewable Limit” scenarios).",

    "description": "Based on Landgate’s high resolution aerial imagery, CSIRO generate the Urban Monitor mosaic from which vegetation height strata of endemic and exotic species has been calculated and reported as an area for each height strata of 0 – 3 m, 3 – 8 m, 8 – 15 m and 15+ m. The area of grass covered areas falling into the 0 – 50 cm range has also been calculated and recorded in square metres. Vegetation coverage greater than 3 metres in height has been deemed tree canopy. The canopies have been aggregated and reported as total canopy coverage in square metres. Urban Forest Mesh Blocks have been published for the following years: 2009, 2014, 2016, 2018, 2024.\n\nParcels to be analysed were sourced from the 2024 Integrated Land Information Database (ILID) and supplied to CSIRO by the Department of Planning, Lands and Heritage. The results were assembled into Urban Forest features where the Urban Monitor coverage was complete.\n\nLand parcels were assigned locational data (2021 ABS meshblocks, suburbs, local government authority (LGA) and planning sub-region) based on the parcel centroid. They were then attributed with the following land use categories: • Street Block: residential, commercial, industrial, hospital/medical, educational, and some agricultural and transport land uses • Parks: public parks, open space, private recreation grounds and State Forest • Roads: roads including road reserves • Other Infrastructure: rail, airports and utilities infrastructure • Other: land uses in transition that have not progressed sufficiently to be Street Blocks or do not conform to urban form • Rural: primary production land that does not fall in categories above • Water: ocean and other waterways, including reservoirs\n\nThe vegetation height strata areas and total canopy coverage values were calculated for each land parcel. The statistics were then aggregated by the field MB_MonitorCategory, a concatenation of the fields MB_CODE2021 and MonitorCategory. Canopy coverage percentages and ranges were calculated based on the sum of the area of parcels within each MB_MonitoryCategory. As parcels with sufficient Urban Monitor coverage for Urban Forest analysis may vary between years making comparison difficult, a field called MBPercentage was added which shows the percentage of the total MB_MonitorCategory area (MBArea) covered by parcels with Urban Forest values for that year. Corresponding MBPercentage values for all published years were also added to inform users.\n\nNOTE: As mesh block attributes were assigned based on parcel centroid, aggregated mesh block boundaries based on the parcels may not match ABS mesh block boundaries, and MBAreas will not match ABS mesh block areas.",

This specific dataset presents statistics on affordable rental properties by the 2016 Local Government Areas geographic level.\nAffordable rental properties are those within 30 per cent of gross income for low-income households. The rental thresholds are taken from the household incomes for whom that number of bedrooms is a minimum: \n\n\nFor one-bedroom properties, we have taken the income of singles on Newstart allowance;\n\n\nFor two-bedroom properties, we have taken a single parent pensioner with one child aged under 5;\n\n\nFor three-bedroom properties, we have taken a couple on Newstart with two children;\n\n\nFor four-bedroom properties, we have taken a couple on Newstart with four children.\n\n\nThe Rental Report provides the most accurate information on the private rental market in Victoria. The data come from records kept by the Residential Tenancies Bond Authority (RTBA). The RTBA is responsible for receiving, registering and refunding all bonds associated with private residential leases in Victoria.\nFor more information please visit the Department of Health and Human Services.",

    "description": "Aerial photographs of Heard Island taken by 1987/88 ANARE.\n\nThe information below was taken from the ANARE report prepared after the Heard Island visit.\n\nPHOTOGRAPHIC ACTIVITIES, 1987/88.\n\nEric J. Woehler\n\nMovie and aerial photography were undertaken during the 87/88 visit.\n\nAERIAL PHOTOGRAPHY\n\nThe aerial photography was limited to two days, concurrent with the resupply visit by MV Nella Dan during Voyage 2, 18 and 19 October 1987.\n\nA Linhoff camera was mounted in one (HRK) of the two Hughes 500D helicopters on board and two 100 metre rolls of 70mm film were exposed. The first roll was exposed at Spit Island and North and South Spit on 18 October.  The second roll was exposed around the Four Bays region, Saddle Point, Hoseason Beach and the archaeological site at Sealers Corner, Corinthian Bay on 19 October. Details of each roll are given in Table 1.\n\nTable 1.

Photography of the harems on North and South Spit and the Four Bays region provided the opportunity of verifying ground counts made on the same day. All exposures were made at approximately 60 knots ground-speed.  Flying heights were generally confined to below 350' at Atlas Cove by a low cloud cover and to 500' at Spit by strong winds at higher altitudes.\n\nFlight lines and photo centres representing the Roll 1 aerial photography (Film ANTC1082) are included in the aerial photography data available for download (see provided URL) and have Qinfo = 760. The flight lines and photo centres are provided as shapefiles and Qinfo is an attribute of the shapefiles. \n\nSee the Quality field for comments about the flight lines and photo centres.\n\nThe Australian Antarctic Division (AAD) has prints of some Roll 1 frames. They were stitched together, and glued to a presentation board but have since been separated from the board and stored in an archival box. Print = Y in the attribute table of the photo centres shapefile indicates there is a print for that frame. The prints are not available for loan outside the AAD. \n\nContact the Australian Antarctic Data Centre for access to the prints:\n\nhttp://data.aad.gov.au/aadc/requests/request.cfm",

    "description": "This dataset presents counts of payment recipients by payment type for the quarter ending September 2018. The data is based on the recipient's geocoded address aggregated by Local Government Area (LGA) from the Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS) 2014.\nThe Department of Social Services (DSS) is the Australian Government's lead agency in the development and delivery of social policy, and is working to improve the lifetime wellbeing of people and families in Australia. DSS' policies and services respond to need across people's lives - looking after families, children and older people; providing a safety net for people who cannot fully support themselves; enhancing the wellbeing of people with high needs; assisting people who need help with care; and supporting a diverse and harmonious society. DSS supports people and families in Australia by encouraging independence and participation, and supporting a cohesive society.\nFor more information on this dataset please visit the Australian Government Open Data.\nFor further details on payments, see 'A guide to Australian Government payments'.\nPlease note:\n\n\nIn order to protect individuals' privacy, identified populations between 1 and 4 have been suppressed and replaced with '&lt;5' for confidentiality purposes. Additional data may be suppressed and replaced with 'n.p.' (not provided) to prevent the derivation of identified populations that have values of less than 5.\n\n\nIndividuals who live overseas, individuals who are without a valid home address and individuals who only have a postal address cannot be assigned to a locational boundary. State/territory totals derived from Local Government Area data will not match actual state and territory totals, due to different statistical geography methodologies.\n\n\nCaveats specific to payments type can be found in the relevant payment description of the original data.\n\n\nAURIN has spatialised this dataset and have made the following replacements to enforce data type consistency: \n\n\n'&lt;5' has been assigned a value of '-1' within the data\n\n\nA boolean field has been created for each data field to flag left-censored data. 'True' is assigned to fields that have been censored.\n\n\n'n.p.' (not provided) has been set to Null within the data.\n\n",

Researchers at the Australian National University (ANU) developed CLAM in 2004 when contracted by the NSW State Government to provide sustainability assessments of 8 coastal lakes. Several projects have since been established directly with local government and NRM groups.\n\nTo date, 27 CLAMs have been developed in New South Wales, where they generally fit within estuary management or catchment management plans. To develop these CLAMs and build local capacity to maintain them, ANU-Enterprise Pty Ltd - the commercial company of ANU developed an Accreditation Scheme whereby local consultants are trained in the CLAM approach.",

    "description": "Overview  \r\n As part of a three year (2015-16 to 2017-18) joint project between Forest and Wood Products Australia (FWPA) and ABARES, ABARES developed quarterly sales volume forecasts for selected wood products from the FWPA Softwood Data series. This technical report documents the methods and assumption underlying ABARES forecasts. \r\n\r\n Key Issues  \r\n• The FWPA Softwood Data Series (FWPA 2016) was established in 2002 by Australia's major softwood sawmilling companies and provides monthly sales volumes for 44 detailed product categories. ABARES was tasked to estimate quarterly forecasts for four specific wood products; untreated structural pine less than 120mm, untreated structural pine greater than 120mm, termite treated structural pine and landscape wood products. These forecasts will be made available for members of the FWPA data dashboard. \r\n\r\n\r\n• The econometric models estimated in the report are not based on formal structural economic models of the relevant wood product markets. Instead, they are simple, statistically robust, predictive models that are based on historical relationships and patterns observed over the sample period. \r\n\r\n\r\n• In interpreting or using ABARES forecasts it should be noted, that the FWPA Softwood Data series do not include all producers in the industry and the number of participating producers is changing over time. As such, the series are not representative of national production or sales and the effects of new entrants in the data series has the potential to affect the validity of the estimated models. The models estimated in this study, and approaches used to generate forecasts, will be periodically reviewed by ABARES in order to improve the accuracy of forecasts over time. \r\n",

    "description": "The EAC1 deepwater mooring was deployed in April 2012 at (-27.31 S, 153.98 E) off the Queensland coast, near Brisbane, Australia. The mooring was recovered in August 2013 and the array decommissioned, and a newly configured array (with new moorings) was redeployed in May 2015. \n\nInstrumentation on the mooring includes 75kHz Acoustic Doppler Current Profilers (Long Ranger ADCPs), Seabird SBE37SMPs, temperature loggers (Star Oddi, Starmon Mini) and discrete current meters (Aquadopp 6000).\n\nThe mooring will collect a time series of full-depth profiles of water velocity and discrete temperature and salinity measurements. \n\nThe array will consist of 9 current meter and property moorings extending eastward from the Queensland Coastal Node shelf mooring array near Brisbane to the deep ocean. The moorings will be at 500-600 m intervals across the Continental Slope and increasing to 800-1000 m in the deep ocean.  \n\nThe East Australian Current (EAC) is the major western boundary current of the south Pacific Ocean. It plays a critical role in the ocean re-distribution of global heat from the equator to the midand- high latitudes. The EAC is relatively stable north of Brisbane, but as the current moves south\n2-3 large eddies are pinched off every year. These eddies frequently move onto the continental shelf and close inshore and influence the local circulation patterns. At prominent coastal features the EAC moves away from the coast, driving upwelling which draws nutrient-rich water from a depth of 200-m or more.",

    "description": "This dataset contains information from the second health subdomain 'Vulnerable - Physical independence', of the Australian Early Development Censuses (AEDC) from 2009 - 2018. The data is based on 2016 Statistical Areas Level 2 (SA2) boundaries.\nThe AEDC is a population-based measure of children's development as they enter their first year of full-time school, and takes place nationally every three years. It looks at five domains of early childhood development: physical health and wellbeing (plus three health sub-domains), social competence, emotional maturity, language and cognitive skills, and communication skills and general knowledge.\nFor more information visit the AEDC website.\nPlease note suppression of AEDC data occurs when one or more of the following have been met:\n\n\nThree or fewer children had been assessed\n\n\nFewer than fifteen children had valid AEDC scores\n\n\nLess than two teachers had completed AEDC instruments for children in that location\n\n\nAEDC instruments were completed for less than 80% of all non special needs children\nAdditional minor suppression's have occurred where necessary to preserve confidentiality of related suppressed cells.\n\n\nPlease Note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data.\n\n\nSome AEDC results were captured across two SA2 regions, AURIN has excluded these results from this dataset.\n\n",

    "description": "Paper presented at the Australian Agricultural and Resource Economics Society (AARES) 2016 Conference. \r\n\r\n Australian Commonwealth fisheries are managed with the objective of maximising economic returns to the Australian community - an objective that may be served by increasing the efficiency of the fishing fleet. This paper presents a stochastic frontier analysis (SFA) of the Commonwealth Trawl Sector (CTS) of the Southern and Eastern Scalefish and Shark Fishery. ABARES used boat-level data to explore the potential of the SFA approach to determine the efficiency of the fleet and find reasons for any inefficiencies. \r\n\r\n This preliminary work: • indicates significant inefficiency in the CTS fleet \r\n• provides some support for the hypothesis that a structural adjustment in 2006 resulted in less efficient boats leaving the fishery, which led to improved economic returns \r\n• shows that interannual effects, such as stock availability, management changes and technical change, play a large role in the estimated frontier and must be disentangled from each other in further work to provide more information for managers.\r\n",

Janas (IMOS platform code: ZMTW).\n\nDeparted:  Southern Ocean, August 21, 2009\nArrived:  \tHobart, Australia, August 25, 2009\n\nBio acoustic signals allow understanding how mid-water prey species (known collectively as micronekton) such as small fish, squid, krill and jellyfish are distributed. \n\nMid-water prey form the core of the ocean food web, transferring energy from primary producers at the ocean surface to top predators such as tunas, billfish, sharks, seals and seabirds.The mass and distribution of micronekton reflects broad-scale patterns in the structure and function of the ocean, as well as the dynamics of marine ecosystems. \n\nAcoustic mapping is done from fishing and scientific vessels that are equipped with scientifically-calibrated 38 kHz digital echo-sounders that record a slice of acoustic backscatter to a depth of 1500 meters.",

    "description": "The survey was completed as part of ASAC project 1219 (ASAC_1219) during 1999/00 summer at Casey during resupply.  GPS data were collected for all snow petrel nests located during intensive searches of ice-free areas in the Casey Station extended recreation area.\n\nThis work was completed as part of ASAC project 1219 (ASAC_1219).\n\nThe data are a subset of the data available for downloading, the data with dataset id = 182. Each feature has a Qinfo value which can be used to access data quality information.\n\nPublic summary for project 1219:\n\nThis project provides population data on Antarctic and Subantarctic seabirds that permit assessments to be made of natural population trends at local to regional scales, so that changes in populations due to to human disturbance, such as station activities and helicopter operations can be identified.",

    "description": "Data were collected as part of the FutureReef MAP project, a three-year project designed to monitor ocean chemistry along the entire length of the Great Barrier Reef. The Future Reef MAP project is funded by Rio Tinto Alcan and administered by the Great Barrier Reef Foundation, with an equal co-investment by CSIRO. The project is the first large-scale CO2 observing system established on the Great Barrier Reef using the Rio Tinto ship, RTM Wakmatha. The research is targeted at providing information on the CO2 uptake and the controls on ocean acidification change in the region. It is providing foundation data needed to assess the vulnerability of the GBR reefs to ocean acidification. This dataset contains quality controlled underway measurements of the fugacity of CO2, atmospheric pressure, and sea surface temperature and salinity. The data management and distribution of these data were supported by the CSIRO Carbon Collaboration Cluster and the Australian Coastal Ecosystem Facility.",

Orthophotos combine the image characteristics of a photograph with the geometric qualities of a map and can be used as a backdrop layer in conjunction with other spatial information.\n\n\nSpatial Resolution - 6 cm\nSpatial Accuracy - +/- 3pixels @ 68% confidence (Sigma 1)\nMap Projection - Web Mercator Auxiliary Sphere\nRectification Surface - DTM (supplied by DNRM in .img format)\nDescription of rectification - High end commercial photogrammetric software and Aerometrex proprietary software has been utilised in the ortho rectification and mosaicing process. This methodology assists Aerometrex to produce a seamless geo-referenced orthophotography product.\nTile Size / Grid - 1km x 1km GeoTIFF Tiles\n\n<b>Limitations of Data</b>\nThis dataset contains imagery which has been aero-triangulated, spatially adjusted and rectified using a digital ground surface model. The stated spatial accuracy of this product is relevant for features present at ground level only. Elevated structures (roof-tops, tree canopies, etc) will be affected by relief displacement and cannot be reliably measured from this product. Spatial accuracy is reduced in areas of dense vegetation. ",

    "description": "This data release consists of flux tower measurements of the exchange of energy and mass between the surface and the atmospheric boundary-layer in semi-arid eucalypt woodland using eddy covariance techniques. It been processed using PyFluxPro (v3.3.0) as described in Isaac et al. (2017), <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-14-2903-2017\">https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-14-2903-2017</a>. PyFluxPro takes data recorded at the flux tower and process this data to a final, gap-filled product with Net Ecosystem Exchange (NEE) partitioned into Gross Primary Productivity (GPP) and Ecosystem Respiration (ER). For more information about the processing levels, see <a href=\"https://github.com/OzFlux/PyFluxPro/wiki\">https://github.com/OzFlux/PyFluxPro/wiki</a>.\n \n The site was situated within a wetland that flooded seasonally. The principle vegetation was <em>Oryza rufipogon</em>, <em>Pseudoraphis spinescens</em> and <em>Eleocharis dulcis</em>. The elevation was approximately 4m, with a neighbouring Bureau of Meteorology station recording 1411mm mean annual precipitation.Maximum temperatures ranged from 31.3°C (in June and July) to 35.6°C (in October), while minimum temperatures ranged from 14.9°C (in July) to 23.9°C (in December and February). Maximum temperatures varied on a seasonal basis by approximately 4.3°C and minimum temperatures by 9.0°C.  The instrument mast was 15m tall. Heat, water vapour and carbon dioxide measurements are taken using the open-path eddy flux technique. Temperature, humidity, wind speed, wind direction, rainfall, incoming and reflected shortwave radiation and net radiation were measured above the canopy. Soil heat fluxes were measured and soil moisture content was gathered using time domain reflectometry. Ancillary measurements taken at the site include LAI, leaf-scale physiological properties (gas exchange, leaf isotope ratios, N and chlorophyll concentrations), vegetation optical properties and soil physical properties. Airborne based remote sensing (Lidar and hyperspectral measurements) was carried out across the transect in September 2008. ",

    "description": "The EAC2 deepwater mooring was deployed in April 2012 at (-27.30 S, 154.03 E) off the Queensland coast, near Brisbane, Australia. The mooring was recovered in August 2013 and the array decommissioned, and a newly configured array (with new moorings) was redeployed in May 2015. \n\nInstrumentation on the mooring includes Acoustic Doppler Current Profilers (ADCPs): Long Ranger, Sentinel 300 and Quartermaster, Seabird SBE37SMPs, temperature loggers (Star Oddi, Starmon Mini) and discrete current meters (Aquadopp 6000).\n\nThe mooring will collect a time series of full-depth profiles of water velocity and discrete temperature and salinity measurements. \n\nThe array will consist of 9 current meter and property moorings extending eastward from the Queensland Coastal Node shelf mooring array near Brisbane to the deep ocean. The moorings will be at 500-600 m intervals across the Continental Slope and increasing to 800-1000 m in the deep ocean.  \n\nThe East Australian Current (EAC) is the major western boundary current of the south Pacific Ocean. It plays a critical role in the ocean re-distribution of global heat from the equator to the midand- high latitudes. The EAC is relatively stable north of Brisbane, but as the current moves south\n2-3 large eddies are pinched off every year. These eddies frequently move onto the continental shelf and close inshore and influence the local circulation patterns. At prominent coastal features the EAC moves away from the coast, driving upwelling which draws nutrient-rich water from a depth of 200-m or more.",

It is best suited to the 350-600 mm rainfall zone where most extensive crops are grown (i.e. the wheatbelt), though may be extended to include some slightly higher rainfall areas. Crops included in this general assessment are wheat, barley, oats, narrow-leafed lupins, field peas, canola, chickpea and faba beans.\n\nLand capability refers to the ability of land to support a type of land use without causing damage. See DAFWA Resource Management Technical Report 298 for a description of the qualities assessed and the methodology involved.\n\nCapability ratings do not take into account factors such as the availability and quality of water supplies for irrigation or climatic risks such as frost or heat stress. Such factors need to be considered as a separate layer of information.",

    "description": "This dataset contains quality controlled meteorological observations and bulk air-sea fluxes. \n\nEnhancement of Measurements on Ships of Opportunity (SOOP) - Air Sea Flux (ASF) Southern Surveyor collects underway meteorological and oceanographic observations during scientific voyages in the oceans adjacent to Australia. \n\nData streams are fed into the existing ship data management system, and broadcast via satellite back to Australia 3-hourly. The observations are quality controlled at the Bureau of Meteorology and air-sea fluxes calculated using the COARE Bulk Flux algorithm. \n\nA daily file of 5-minute average calculated bulk fluxes are generated shortly after 0000UTC and provided to eMII.\n\nThe data is contained in NetCDF format files and consists of input QC'd meteorological observations as well as calculated air-sea fluxes. The fluxes are calculated using the COARE Bulk Flux algorithm version 3.0. Input observations are selected from multiple data-streams in the cases of; wind (upwind instrument selected); air temperature and humidity (upwind instrument selected), and short (maximum value used) and long-wave (minimum value used). Other input observations included are sea surface temperatures (SST) and air pressure. Calculated fluxes include, sensible heat, latent heat, outgoing long-wave, outgoing short-wave and heat due to precipitation. The calculated skin SST value is included. Flags are provided to indicate which sensor (when multiple are available) has been used as input to compute the flux. QC flags are not provided as fluxes are only computed when good data is available.",

    "description": "The atomic interstellar medium shows tiny-scale optical depth fluctuations on the scale of 0.1~10,000 AU, whose origin and nature are poorly understood. The existence of this Tiny-Scale Atomic Structure (TSAS) has significant implications, potentially calling into question our fundamental understanding of heating, cooling and dynamical processes in the interstellar medium. Yet observations remain sparse. This long-term project plans to search for temporal variations in HI absorption spectra seen against background pulsars to characterise TSAS in the Milky Way interstellar medium (ISM). These observations constitute the largest number of sightlines and densest temporal sampling ever performed in a single experiment, and will test predictions that TSAS is the tail end of a turbulent cascade, constrain its minimum size scale (down to resolutions of ~0.05 AU) and potentially provide the first direct measurements of pressures in \"large\" TSAS features of &gt; 1000 AU. We make use of the phase-resolved spectral line mode that we have recently implemented on Parkes, which has cut data rates and processing times by factors of ~1000 compared to past studies. This is an expansion of our pilot P1321 to a long term study.",

The study was governed by a Grant Agreement between Councils and the CSIRO, which stated an intent for the data to be published. This specific dataset is presented at a block level scale. It includes both commercial and residential buildings and is a 2026 business-as-usual projection, relative to a 2011 baseline. It does not include the industrial sector.",

    "description": "This data was collected in September - November 2012 by the IMOS Ship of Opportunity Underway CO2 Measurement research group on RV Aurora Australis (IMOS platform code: VNAA) voyage AA1213VMS.\n\nDeparted: \tHobart, Tasmania, September 14, 2012\nArrived:  Hobart, Tasmania,  November 16, 2012\n\nCO2 System Overview:\nThe fugacity of carbon dioxide (fCO2) in surface seawater was measured using a General Oceanics Inc. automated system (Model 8050; Pierrot et al 2009). Seawater is sprayed into an equilibration chamber and CO2 in the headspace gas equilibrates with the seawater. The headspace gas is pumped through a thermoelectric condenser followed by a nafion drying tube before flowing through a Licor 7000 non-dispersive infrared gas analyser used to measure the CO2 mole fraction (XCO2) of the dried air. The gas flow is stopped temporarily for the CO2 measurements, which are made at atmospheric pressure. A set of four CO2 standards that cover the range of CO2 values expected in the ocean are analysed about every three hours to calibrate the gas analyser.  Atmospheric XCO2 (dry) is measured after the standards by pumping clean outside air from an intake on the forward mast of the ship. \n\nSeawater intake and ancillary data:\nThe seawater intake is at about 6 m depth. A remote temperature sensor (Seabird Electronics SBE38) located at the intake is used to measure sea surface temperature (SST). Sea surface salinity is measured using a thermosalinograph (Seabird Electronics SBE21) mounted in the oceanographic lab next to the pCO2 system. The travel time between the intake and CO2 system is typically about 70 seconds with warming usually less than 0.7ºC in cold waters near freezing. The thermosalinograph water is from the same intake and supply line. \n\nMeteorological data, salinity, SST, and ships position and time are taken from the ship’s logging system.",

Since its inception in 1966 the Geographical Names Board has recorded information in relation to NSW geographical names within the GNR. There are currently over eighty thousand place names recorded in the GNR. On average, 200 new place names are assigned and added to this database every year.\nEvery record in this database has the provision for over thirty attributes ranging from spatial location information in respect to co-ordinate, map tile, parish etc. to cultural information on history, meaning and origin. The GNR also holds official information such as the name’s status and feature type, and temporal information dealing with the gazettal date of the name.",

    "description": "This dataset is the June 2022 release of Geoscape Planning for a single SA2 area (Hobart) with SA2 code (61027).\nPlanning provides detailed planning zone codes and descriptions for parcels of land across Australia. By representing the detailed planning classification for each parcel as well as links to the relevant planning scheme/instrument. Planning provides a simple lookup for the classification on sites nationally, as well as linkages to enable further understanding of a site's potential. Planning is created through combining Geoscape Australia's Cadastre product with Planning Zones defined by a State, Territory or Local Government.\nFor more information regarding Geoscape Planning, please refer to the Data Product Description and the June 2022 Release Notes.\nPlease note: As per the licence for this data, the information is limited to a single Level 2 Statistical Area (SA2) mentioned above as defined by the Australian Bureau of Statistics. If you require additional data beyond a single SA2 for your research, please request a quote from AURIN.\nPlanning zones provide a method to divide land and describe the types of development that may occur at a location, and often describe other developmental requirements such as the height, setback or form of the structures that can be built. Planning zones allow State, Territory and local Governments to facilitate urban planning and control the development of land.\nThrough representing the planning classification from a planning zone at a Cadastre cadastral parcel level, Planning provides a granular representation of the potential for development at each site, alongside URL linkages to enable further research directly from the authoritative definition.\nThis dataset has been restricted to the Hobart SA2 by AURIN. AURIN has extracted the selected SA2 area information from this dataset through using geometries from the May 2022 Geoscape Cadastre release. The dataset, therefore, is a tabular dataset for the selected SA2 area. ",

Modelled on the World Economic Forums Global Competitiveness Report [In]Sight was developed in collaboration with Deloitte Access Economics and combines data from sources including the Australian Bureau of Statistics and the Social Health Atlas of Australia.\nInfrastructure and transport (and by extension essential services) are crucial elements in determining the location of and type of investment activities and business sectors that can develop in a region.\nWell-developed infrastructure particularly dependable electricity and telecommunications systems are an integral component of business production. Similarly effective transport systems are vital in allowing regions to move their goods and services in a secure and timely fashion. Both of these measures directly influence a region's competitiveness as they improve the region's ability to host economic activities through adequate infrastructure and also increase the region's ability to interact with other markets.",

    "description": "The Wilderness Inventory was first prepared in the early 1990s as a series of maps identifying wilderness quality through two key attributes: remoteness and naturalness.\n\nWhile the dataset had not been updated for many years, it remained a valuable baseline tool in South Australia for implementing the Wilderness Protection Act 1992 (WP Act), which requires that all land in the state is assessed for its wilderness quality.\n\nIn late 2022, the Department for Environment and Water (DEW), in partnership with the Parks and Wilderness Council and The Wilderness Society, commissioned the University of Queensland to develop an updated Wilderness Inventory. This study used two refined attributes for identifying wilderness quality: modern industrial levels and habitat area, quality and fragmentation.\n\nThe outputs of this study include a technical report, spatial datasets (including a metadata file), and a map of the state.

    "description": "The Soil Moisture Integration and Prediction System (SMIPS) produces national extent daily estimates of volumetric soil moisture at a resolution of approximately 1km or 0.01 decimal degrees. SMIPS also generates an index of between 0-1 which approximates how full the 90cm metre soil moisture store is at a particular location and time. The SMIPS model itself consists of two linked soil moisture stores, a shallow quick responding 10cm upper store and a deeper, slower responding 80cm store. \nSMIPS is parameterised using physical properties from the <a href=\"https://esoil.io/TERNLandscapes/Public/Pages/SLGA/index.html\">Soil and Landscape Grid of Australia </a>and takes a data model fusion approach for model forcing. Version 1.0 of the SMIPS model uses precipitation and potential evapotranspiration data from the Bureau of Meteorology’s <a href=\"https://awo.bom.gov.au/assets/notes/publications/AWRALv6_Model_Description_Report.pdf\">AWRA Model</a>. In addition to version 1.0 of the model, an experimental version of the model is available for user testing. This version of the model uses precipitation data supplied by an experimental CSIRO daily rainfall surface generated using spatial data from the NASA Global Precipitation Mission as a base and enhanced using rainfall observations from the Bureau of Meteorology (BoM) rainfall gauge network, and various landscape covariates, processed using a machine learning approach. \nTo help increase model accuracy, the internal SMIPS model states are adjusted or ‘bumped’ by daily observational data from the European Space Agency’s Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) satellite mission.",

It will be fitted with surface salinity and bottom depth and temperature in late 2008. \n\nThe unit will be serviced every six months and will be used in the future for attaching new sets of sensors. The buoy is re-locatable and the GPS data should be used to find the current location.",

    "description": "CSIRO Biodiversity Habitat Index (BHI v2) is a global 30 arc-second product for 2000,2005,2010,2015 and 2020. BHI estimates the level of species diversity expected to be retained within any given spatial reporting unit (e.g., a country, a broad ecosystem type, or the entire planet) as a function of the unit’s area, connectivity and integrity of natural ecosystems across it. Results for the indicator can either be expressed as 1) the ‘effective proportion of habitat’ remaining within the unit – adjusting for the effects of the condition and functional connectivity of habitat, and of spatial variation in the species composition of ecological communities (beta diversity); or 2) the effective proportion of habitat that can be translated, through standard species-area analysis, into a prediction of the proportion of species expected to persist (i.e. avoid extinction) over the long term.       \n\nThe BHI is used to monitor and report past-to-present trends in the expected persistence of species diversity by repeatedly recalculating the indicator using best-available mapping of ecosystem condition or integrity observed at multiple points in time, e.g., for different years. A wide variety of data sources can be used for this purpose, spanning spatial scales from global to subnational, and including data assembled by countries for deriving ecosystem condition accounts under the UN SEEA Ecosystem Accounting framework. The BHI can also serve as a leading indicator for assessing the contribution that proposed or implemented area-based actions are expected to make towards enhancing the present capacity of ecosystems to retain species diversity, thereby providing a foundation for strategic prioritisation of such actions by countries.\n\nAggregation of the raw data for reporting by a region (country, ecoregion etc.) should follow the procedure in the folder \" Calculating weighted geometric means of CSIRO BILBI indicators for a region\"",

Groups of ASGS Statistical Area 4 (SA4) boundaries in NSW have been combined into 11 groups for reporting and publication of department data. Previous publications compared enrolments in DEC regions.\n\n\nStudents in Distance Education and Opportunity Classes (OC) are included with their appropriate grade levels.\n\n\nAggregate geographical data are reported by groupings of ABS statistical area 4 (refer to the maps in the Statistical Bulletin Explanatory Notes).\n\n\nStudents are counted as Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander if they are identified and accepted as such by the community with which they are associated, and they identify themselves on the school enrolment form.\n\n\nAs of 2022, Norfolk Island (previously included in NSW total) is no longer under the jurisdiction of NSW, and therefore not included in the figures.\n\n\nData Source:\n\nSchools and Students: Statistical Bulletin.

    "description": "## **Abstract** \n\nThis dataset was derived by the Bioregional Assessment Programme from multiple source datasets. The source datasets are identified in the Lineage field in this metadata statement. The processes undertaken to produce this derived dataset are described in the History field in this metadata statement.\n\n\n\nThis dataset contains the data and scripts to generate the hydrological response variables for surface water in the Clarence Moreton subregion as reported in CLM261 (Gilfedder et al. 2016).\n\n## **Dataset History** \n\nFile CLM_AWRA_HRVs_flowchart.png shows the different files in this dataset and how they interact. The python and R-scripts are written by the BA modelling team to, as detailed below, read, combine and analyse the source datasets CLM AWRA model, CLM groundwater model V1 and CLM16swg Surface water gauging station data within the Clarence Moreton Basin to create the hydrological response variables for surface water as reported in CLM2.6.1 (Gilfedder et al. 2016).\n\n\n\nR-script HRV_SWGW_CLM.R reads, for each model simulation, the outputs from the surface water model in netcdf format from file Qtot.nc (dataset CLM AWRA model) and the outputs from the groundwater model, flux_change.csv (dataset CLM groundwater model V1) and creates a set of files in subfolder /Output for each GaugeNr and simulation Year:\n\nCLM_GaugeNr_Year_all.csv and CLM_GaugeNR_Year_baseline.csv: the set of 9 HRVs for GaugeNr and Year for all 5000 simulations for baseline conditions\n\nCLM_GaugeNr_Year_CRDP.csv: the set of 9 HRVs for GaugeNr and Year for all 5000 simulations for CRDP conditions (=AWRA streamflow - MODFLOW change in SW-GW flux)\n\nCLM_GaugeNr_Year_minMax.csv: minimum and maximum of HRVs over all 5000 simulations\n\n\n\nPython script CLM_collate_DoE_Predictions.py collates that information into following files, for each HRV and each maxtype (absolute maximum (amax), relative maximum (pmax) and time of absolute maximum change (tmax)):\n\nCLM_AWRA_HRV_maxtyp_DoE_Predictions: for each simulation and each gauge_nr, the maxtyp of the HRV over the prediction period (2012 to 2102)\n\nCLM_AWRA_HRV_DoE_Observations: for each simulation and each gauge_nr, the HRV for the years that observations are available\n\nCLM_AWRA_HRV_Observations: summary statistics of each HRV and the observed value (based on data set CLM16swg Surface water gauging station data within the Clarence Moreton Basin)\n\nCLM_AWRA_HRV_maxtyp_Predictions: summary statistics of each HRV\n\n\n\nR-script CLM_CreateObjectiveFunction.R calculates for each HRV the objective function value for all simulations and stores it in CLM_AWRA_HRV_ss.csv. This file is used by python script CLM_AWRA_SI.py to generate figure CLM-2615-002-SI.png (sensitivity indices).\n\n\n\nThe AWRA objective function is combined with the overall objective function from the groundwater model in dataset CLM Modflow Uncertainty Analysis (CLM_MF_DoE_ObjFun.csv) into csv file CLM_AWRA_HRV_oo.csv. This file is used to select behavioural simulations in python script CLM-2615-001-top10.py.

The area extends approximately 60 km north to south and approximately 20 km east to west comprising some 18 graticular blocks and about 1,308 square kilometres (km2). The area completely contains the Gloucester Geological Basin. The PEL area excludes existing mining leases (except Stratford Colliery), National Parks, state forest or nature reserves, Aboriginal areas and land vested in the Commonwealth of Australia. There are no World Heritage Areas or Ramsar Wetlands within the PEL. The PEL overlays the Local Government Areas of the Gloucester Shire and Great Lakes Council. \n\n\n\nPEL 285 was granted in 1992 under the Petroleum (Onshore) Act, 1991. In December 2008 AGL Energy acquired PEL 285 from the joint venture of Lucas \n\nEnergy and Molopo to become the sole operator. The licence enables investigation of the potential for coal seam methane resources in the Gloucester Basin with a view to possible development of a coal seam methane production field in the near future.

    "title": "Lake Macquarie LGA Vegetation Community Map 2022 VIS_ID 5117 - Version 2",
    "description": "This dataset comprises of native vegetation communities within the boundaries of native vegetation extant in the Lake Macquarie City Council (LMCC) Local Government Area (LGA). These communities were originally mapped by Stephen Bell and Collin Driscoll using the methodology outlined in Bell, S.A.J. &amp; Driscoll, C. (2016) and are as amended by LMCC by bi-annual review.\n\nThe methodology is a composite of field survey (rapid data points) and vegetation mapping from various reports. Additional edits have been made by LMCC where attribution and/or lineage has found to be in error, or more intensive field site survey has been undertaken. Native vegetation extant is derived from the LMCC Native Vegetation and Corridor mapping (updated using 2022 nearmap imagery).\n\nThe internal Map Unit (MU) delineation accuracy varies according to the source data at each point.  The intention is to improve accuracy over time. The accuracy of the vegetation extant is &lt;10m. All data requires careful interpretation with consideration of the accuracy field at any location. Full floristic plot survey and multivariate analysis has not been undertaken for many of the map units, hence their position in the classification hierarchy requires further confirmation.  This dataset should not be used as a substitute for full site-specific floristic survey using standard techniques (quadrats &amp; transects etc) and should be used in conjunction with the supporting reports.\n\nThe vegetation community classification system used is LHCCREMS (NPWS) 2000, with subgroups and additional communities where no equivalent exists to form LMCC Map Units (MU). Equivalent NSW State Government Plant Community Types (PCTs) were assigned to LMCC vegetation community map units by S. Bell with varying degrees of confidence:\n<ul>\n<li>High matches are generally those where sufficient similarities are evident;</li>\n<li>Medium, where some uncertainties are present; and</li>\n<li>Low where there is considerable doubt over the match, but due to the absence of better matches these have been selected.</li>\n<li>“No clear match” is for map units that occur in a very small area of the City and given they are local variations cannot be assigned to broader based PCT classification.</li>\n</ul>\n\nNationally listed Threatened Endangered Ecological Communities (TECs) are indicative only, and require onsite investigation. For Nationally listed species composition, condition, connectivity and patch size need to be verified in accordance with the relevant conservation advice.  TECs are based in the first instance on the LMCC Map Unit. Where the LMCC Map Unit has not been assigned to a TEC but the equivalent eastern NSW PCT lists an associated Threatened Ecological Community, the TEC is listed in this dataset with the suffix “(possible, from PCT)”.\n\nVersion 2 changes:\nIn 2023 amendments were made to the mapping, with the updated version titled “Lake Macquarie LGA Vegetation Community Map 2022 – Version 2”. These amendments include:\n<ul>\n<li>Inclusion of data fields relating to the eastern NSW PCTs, including E. NSW PCT ID, E. NSW PCT Name and Confidence in the E. NSW PCT assigned to each LMCC map unit.</li>\n<li>Incorporation of Saltmarsh and Mangrove polygons identified by NSW Department of Primary Industries (NSW DPI) as part of their estuary habitat mapping in 2022.</li>\n<li>Field checking and adjustment of some vegetation communities in the vicinity of South Creek, Eleebana, in response to a request by Lake Macquarie Landcare.</li>\n</ul>\n\nFor more information including conversion tables between LMCC map units and Plant Communities and supporting reports see: https://www.lakemac.com.au/Development/Planning-controls/Local-Planning-Controls/Development-Guidelines or contact Lake Macquarie Council council@lakemac.nsw.gov.au\n\nVIS_ID 5117",

    "description": "Flow cytometry data was collected in August 2008, in waters off South Australia. \n\nThe general purpose of the study is to be able to establish background knowledge on the ecosystem on the continental shelf of South Australia and the impact of upwelling/saline outflow events on microbial communities to ultimately develop a biogeochemical model of the region. Sampling was carried out during cruises conducted on board the RV Ngerin as part of the Southern Australian Integrated Marine System (SAIMOS). During each cruise, the physical, chemical and biological properties of the chlorophyll fluorescence maximum (FM) layer were investigated. Flow cytometry data has been collected for picophytoplankton, bacteria and viruses.\n\nSix main stations have been sampled over the course of the study, five are located on the 100 m isobath, i.e. RS (35.508S, 136.278E), B2 (35.418S, 136.148E), B3 (35.258S, 136.048E), B4 (35.168S, 135.418E) and B5 (35.008S, 135.198E), and one from an offshore station (B1; 36.188S, 136.178E) located southwest of Kangaroo Island. Note that combining the distances between stations (14–25 nautical miles), the average component of the current velocity at middepth along the shelf (0.01 m s21) and the average speed of the vessel (i.e. 9 knots) indicate that different water masses were sampled at each station. Additional samples have on occasion been collected from the National Reference Station (NRS) at Kangaroo Island (35.832S, 136.447E) and the SA Spencer Gulf Mouth Mooring (SAM8SG, 35.25S, 136.690E), where the saline outflow occurs.",

    "title": "IMOS - SRS Satellite Sea Surface Temperature (SST) sub-facility",
    "description": "As part of the Integrated Marine Observing System (IMOS), the Australian Bureau of Meteorology produce high-resolution satellite sea surface temperature (SST) products over the Australian region, designed to suit a range of operational and research applications.  All these products follow the latest International Group for High Resolution Sea Surface Temperature (GHRSST: www.ghrsst.org) file formats, assisting international data exchange and collaboration.\nThe highest spatial resolution (1 km x 1 km) data from Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) sensors on NOAA polar-orbiting satellites can only be obtained through receiving direct broadcast “HRPT” data from the satellite.  In Australia, HRPT data is received by a number of agencies (Bureau of Meteorology, Geoscience Australia, AIMS and CSIRO) and consortia (WASTAC and TERSS) at ground-stations located in Darwin, Townsville, Melbourne, Hobart, Perth and Alice Springs and in Antarctica at Casey and Davis Stations.\n\nThe Bureau of Meteorology, in collaboration with CSIRO Marine and Atmospheric Research, is combining raw data from the various ground-stations and producing real-time HRPT AVHRR skin (~ 10 micron depth) SST data files in the GHRSST GDS v2.0 L2P (single swath, geolocated), L3U (single swath, gridded), one and three day daytime/night-time L3C (single sensor, multiple swath, gridded) and one, three and six day daytime/night-time L3S (multiple sensors, multiple swath, gridded) formats.  The L2P, L3U, L3C and L3S files for NOAA-15, 17, 18 and 19 satellite data are available through the IMOS FTP server (ftp://aodaac2-cbr.act.csiro.au/imos/GHRSST), IMOS AO-DAAC (http://www.marine.csiro.au/remotesensing/imos/aggregator.html# ) and IMOS Ocean Portal (http://imos.aodn.org.au/webportal/), and will eventually be available through the GHRSST Global Data Assembly Centre (http://ghrsst.jpl.nasa.gov).  Archived raw HRPT AVHRR data from Australian and Antarctic ground-stations back to 1992 will be progressively reprocessed into skin SST L2P, L3U, L3C and L3S files and be available to GHRSST and IMOS by June 2013.\nFor the user, there are several advantages to using GHRSST-format SST products.  For each SST value the GHRSST files contain a quality level flag (based on proximity to cloud, satellite zenith angle and day/night) and bias and standard deviation error estimates based on 60 day match-ups with drifting buoy SST data.  Note that the closer an SST pixel is to cloud, the higher the standard deviation.  Therefore, the presence of these quality level flags and error information enable users to tailor the L2P, L3U, L3C or L3S files for their particular research application by trading SST spatial coverage for accuracy and vice versa.  Users have the ability to access L3U, L3C and L3S SST products through IMOS OPeNDAP servers, greatly simplifying data access and extraction.  Providing real-time HRPT AVHRR SST files in GHRSST-L2P format enables them to be incorporated into global and regional, gap-free, analyses of L2P SST from multiple satellites such as NASA’s G1SST global 1 km daily SST analysis and the Bureau of Meteorology’s daily regional and global SST analyses (RAMSSA and GAMSSA).\nThe new IMOS AVHRR L2P SSTs exhibit approximately 75% the error of the Bureau’s pre-existing HRPT AVHRR level 2 SST data, with standard deviations compared with drifting buoys during night-time of around 0.3°C and during daytime of around 0.4°C for quality level 5 (highest). This significant improvement in accuracy has been achieved by improving cloud clearing and calibration - using regional rather than global drifting buoy SST observations and incorporating a dependence on latitude.\nFor further details on the AVHRR GHRSST products see Paltoglou et al. (2010) (http://imos.org.au/srsdoc.html).  Enquiries can be directed to Helen Beggs (h.beggs(at)bom.gov.au).\n\n\nAll the IMOS satellite SST products are supplied in GHRSST netCDF format and are either geolocated swath (\"L2P\") files or level 3 composite, gridded files that will have gaps where there were no observations during the specified time period.  The various L3U (single swath), L3C (single sensor, multiple swath) and L3S (multiple sensors, multiple swaths) are designed to suit different applications.  Some current applications of the various IMOS satellite SST products are:\n\nHRPT AVHRR data:\n\nL2P: Ingestion into optimally interpolated SST analysis systems (eg. RAMSSA, GAMSSA, G1SST, ODYSSEA);\n\nL3U: Calculation of surface ocean currents (IMOS OceanCurrents);\n\nL3C: Estimation of diurnal warming of the surface ocean (GHRSST Tropical Warm Pool Diurnal Variation (TWP+) Project);\n\nL3S: Estimation of likelihood of coral bleaching events (ReefTemp II).\n\nL3P: Legacy 14-day Mosaic AVHRR SST which is a weighted mean SST produced daily from multiple NOAA satellites in a cut-down GHRSST netCDF format.  This product is still used in a coral bleaching prediction system run at CMAR.  The product is produced using the legacy BoM processing system and is less accurate than the new IMOS L3S product.\n\nGeostationary satellite MTSAT-1R data:\n\nL3U: Hourly, 0.05 deg x 0.05 deg SST used for estimation of the diurnal warming of the surface ocean and validation of diurnal warming models (TWP+ Project).",

    "title": "Tide Gauge Records, Macquarie Island",
    "description": "Tides are recorded at Macquarie Island using two sensors, one an acoustic height measuring system and the other a pressure measuring system. The raw records are stored at AADC.\n      The records are processed by The National Tidal Centre to produce tidal records, predictions and residuals.\n        \n      Documentation dated 2001-06-12\n      The Macquarie Island Tide Gauge System\n      \n      The Macquarie Island Tide Gauge was first commissioned in November 1993. Since then every year attempts have been made to improve the performance of the system.\n      The next improvement involves the installation of radio modems to effect a network link to the tide gauge dataloggers. Other improvements planned are include using the wave guide temperatures to correct the water heights for variations in the velocity of sound in air due to temperature gradients in the waveguide. \n      The system consists of two separate sensors contained in separate housings on a rock shelf on the northern side of Garden Cove. One of the sensors is an Aquatrack acoustic type and the other is a Druck pressure transducer. Both housings contain a Platypus Engineering data logger and a battery. The housings consist each of an Admiralty Bronze ring bolted down to a concrete plinth and a glass fibre reinforced cover held down by a single central bolt and nut. \n      Primary power for both installations comes from a solar panel array mounted on the northern side of the rock ridge behind the rock shelf. The solar panels are attached to an aluminium frame which is bolted to a galvanized steel frame cemented into holes in the rock face. The bolts are made of nylon with nylon washers so that the aluminium frame is not in contact with the galvanized frame.\n      Mounted below the panels is a sealed plastic box with a hinged door. A multicore data cable runs from this box to the tide gauge housings. This cable is run inside a length of plastic conduit along with the power cable. The conduit is concealed in the vegetation and at the lower level is cemented into slots cut into the rock\n      The batteries in the housing are kept charged by the solar panels but are isolated via power diodes, one in each housing. Either or both of the housing batteries or only the solar panel battery may be removed without interruption to data logging. The voltage of either housing battery may be found by interrogation of the appropriate data logger.\n      \n      Tide Gauge Bore Holes.\n      \n      Both gauges obtain access to the ocean via an inclined hole about 12 metres long inclined at approximately 34 and 39 degrees to the horizontal. Both holes are lined with a plastic pipe which is normally not removable. In the Aquatrack sensor hole a 50mm ABS pressure pipe runs down inside the liner and is fitted with a brass strainer and orifice at the lower end. This strainer protrudes into the ocean somewhat clear of the sea floor (see figure). Inside the 50mm pipe runs a 15mm diameter plastic pipe. The bottom end of this is fitted with a 600mm length of red brass tubing and stops about 100mm from the orifice at the bottom of the pipe. The 15mm pipe is held central in the 50mm pipe by three armed spiders placed about every metre down the pipe. The top end of both pipes is secured by a flange with two O rings and stainless steel screws. On top of the 15mm pipe is mounted the Aquatrack acoustic sensor the 15mm pipe acting as a waveguide for sound pulses from the sensor (see figure ). The Aquatrack sensor measures the distance of the water surface from a reference point on the sensor. About one metre down the wave guide is a small hole. This has two functions. One is to act as vent to allow water to rise and fall in the wave guide and the other is to provide an acoustic reflection at a known distance down the wave guide. This allows compensation for velocity of sound changes due to temperature changes.\n      The Aquatrak wave guide has a series of thermistors placed along its length. The bottom one is always submerged and is used to measure the seawater temperature..The top one is placed just below the Sensor and the others evenly spaced along the length of the waveguide. The temperature readings from these can be used to compensate for the change in the velocity of sound due to density changes. This feature has not yet been used.\n      The Druck Sensor has a single thermistor placed beside it which measures seawater temperature.\n      \n      System Components. \n      \n      The Aquatrak Installation houses four main components.\n      1. The Aquatrack Sensor and Waveguide Assembly. The sensor itself is in a waterproof plastic tube with a cable with a waterproof connector which plugs into the Bartek controller.\n      2. The Bartek Controller, housed in a waterproof diecast box with waterproof connectors. This lies in the centre of the installation housing.\n      3. The Platypus Engineering Datalogger \n      4. The Battery, a 15 Ah, 12 volt sealed gel cell lead acid battery. It is charged from the solar a diode. The battery lies in the main housing opposite the Datalogger .\n      \n      The Druck Installation houses four main components\n      1. The Druck Pressure Sensor, fitted to the end of a 13 metre cable, submerged in seawater about 10 metres down the borehole.\n      The cable has five conductors and an air vent enclosed within it.\n      2. The Pressure Sensor Amplifier housed in a waterproof diecast box. This box has a vent leading to a vented bottle filled with silica gel to keep the transducer air vent dry.\n      3. A Datalogger As above.\n      4. A battery as above \n      \n      The Solar Panel Installation has three main parts.\n      1. Three Photo Voltaic Solar Panels, two 60 Watt and one 30 Watt. These are mounted on an aluminium frame attached to a hotdip galvanised steel frame with insulating bolts. \n      2. A sealed plastic box mounted below the panels containing a12V 24 Ah Battery and a regulator and the radio modem equipment. (The modems are not currently fitted.)\n      3. Antennae and cables protected with flexible conduit.\n      Data Retrieval\n      \n      Data have been retrieved at approximately 30 day intervals from the Garden Cove gauges by using a portable computer to download the data loggers. The connector for this is in the enclosure by the solar panels allowing the loggers to be accessed during bad weather.\n      \n      Documentation dated 2008-10-17\n      1. In April 2007, the dataloggers and radio modems at Macquarie Island Tide Gauge site were replaced with Campbell Scientific CR1000 dataloggers.\n      2. This change enabled data to be streamed from the pressure sensor datalogger every 30 seconds.\n      3. There has been no change to scaling of records from the Aquatrak sensor as generation of ranges is done by the Aquatrak controller, the datalogger only saving and transmitting the records.\n       Records from the pressure sensor however are now not converted to heights but saved and streamed as raw A/D conversion values.\n       It is intended that appropriate scales and offsets for this sensor be derived after a Floating GPS Buoy exercise.\n      4. Data is streamed from the pressure sensor logger as this is the only sensor that can be supply 30 seconds average values.\n          This logger also streams 3 minute average values.\n      5. The aquatrak sensor logger streams 3 minute average value ranges.\n      6. Data is streamed in NVP (name/Value Pair) format as defined by BoM.\n      7. Embedded in the streams are battery voltage and aquatrak waveguide temperature values.",

This mooring array was discontinued, and this mooring removed in August 2014.\n\nMooring Designs replicate where possible similar instrumentation to the Shelf ITF moorings. Observations of currents, temperature and salinity are collected throughout the array with the coastal mooring also observing optical water quality parameters of fluorescence and turbidity. \n\nThe Pilbara array, in combination with the Kimberly array and the ITF Array will help determine the influence of the Indonesian Throughflow on the currents along the Northwest shelf  and as well as processed driving cross shelf exchange. \n\nThe Pilbara line will help document the variability  in the the northward flowing Ningaloo Current, characterised by cooler waters. In addition, the Pilbara coast is characterised by high evaporation, leading to a cross shelf density gradient.  The cross shelf arrays will allow variability in the  gradient of density and the resultant gravitational currents to be determined.",

    "description": "Data compiled within this feature class is combined extent of the nominated Subtropical and Temperate Coastal Saltmarsh found across the Lower Hunter region (Cessnock, Newcastle, Lake Macquarie, Port Stephens and Maitland LGAs). This data is for the EPBC Act Listed Ecological Communities Mapping in the Lower Hunter project and has been consolidated to help map the extent of Threatened Ecological Communities (TECs) in this area. This data will aid in reviewing and analysing the likelihood of occurrence of EPBC Act listed flora and fauna within the Threatened Ecological Communities, and also support the process of identifying and providing recommendations regarding High Priority Conservation Areas within the region. Recommendations from this data regarding Key Threatening Processes have the potential to impact EPBC Act – listed ecological communities and threatened flora and fauna.\n\n* The GIS mapping data were obtained to inform sustainability planning for the Lower Hunter region, particularly to assist in informing the NSW government review of the NSW Lower Hunter regional strategy and Lower Hunter regional conservation plan.\n * Once this review is complete, the second stage is to undertake a strategic assessment of proposed urban development and related infrastructure corridors. The NSW Government has entered into an agreement with the Commonwealth to conduct a strategic assessment of proposed urban development and related infrastructure corridors.\n* The data provide the best available maps of the regional distribution of two Critically Endangered Ecological Communities protected under national environmental law – the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 (EPBC Act) – as well as the distribution of three vegetation communities nominated for listing as threatened species and ecological communities under the EPBC Act. \n * Vegetation definitions used to map the distribution of the three nominated communities are preliminary and subject to change through the listing determination process. Changes to the definition of a vegetation community may result in changes to the mapped distribution of the community.\n* While reasonable efforts have been made to ensure that the contents of this dataset are factually correct, the Commonwealth does not accept responsibility for the accuracy or completeness of the contents, and shall not be liable for any loss or damage that may be occasioned directly or indirectly through the use of, or reliance on, the contents of this dataset.CC - Attribution (CC BY)\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Australia License.

    "description": "<em>Complete report</em>\n\nThe Albury Floodplain Risk Management Study assesses floodplain management issues in the Albury LGA, and investigates potential management options for the area. The study, which follows on from the flood studies undertaken for the area, has been undertaken in accordance with the NSW Government’s Flood Prone Land Policy. A full assessment of the existing flood risk in the catchment has been carried out, including flood hazard across the various catchments, overfloor flooding of residential, commercial and industrial properties, identification of known flooding issues and hotspots, and emergency response during a flood event. A range of measures aimed at managing this flood risk were also assessed for their efficacy across a range of criteria, which will allow options to be recommended as part of the Floodplain Risk Management Plan for the area. Measures included upgrade of the South Albury levee, retarding basins, pit and pipe upgrades and various property modification measures.",

    "description": "We propose to continue undertake a pulsar survey along the Galactic Plane using the new Methanol Multibeam receiver in order to uncover pulsars previously selected against in lower frequency surveys. The scientific aims of this survey are\n(a) to discover young pulsars in the spiral arms, hidden at lower frequencies, (b) to improve our knowledge of the distribution of dispersing and scattering material, particularly in the inner Galaxy, (c) strike it lucky and discover unique objects (e.g. a pulsar with a black hole companion and short period binary pulsars) and\n(d) to survey the transient radio sky at high frequencies. Simulations have shown that we expect to find a total of 200 pulsars of which about one half will be new detections.",

    "description": "This release consists of flux tower measurements of the exchange of energy and mass between the surface and the atmospheric boundary-layer using eddy covariance techniques. Data were processed using PyFluxPro (v3.4.7) as described by Isaac et al. (2017). PyFluxPro produces a final, gap-filled product with Net Ecosystem Exchange (NEE) partitioned into Gross Primary Productivity (GPP) and Ecosystem Respiration (ER). \n\nThe site is classified as an open woodland savanna. The overstory is co-dominated by tree species <em>Eucalyptus miniata</em> and <em>Eucalyptus tentrodonata</em>, and average tree height is 14-16&nbsp;m. Elevation of the site is close to 64&nbsp;m and mean annual precipitation is 1750&nbsp;mm. Maximum temperatures range from 30.4&nbsp;°C (in July) to 33.2&nbsp;°C (in November), while minimum temperatures range from 19.3&nbsp;°C (in July) to 25.4&nbsp;°C (in November). Therefore, the maximum and minimum range varies from 7&nbsp;°C (wet season) to 11&nbsp;°C (dry season).\n\nThe instrument mast is 23&nbsp;m tall. Heat, water vapour and carbon dioxide measurements are taken using the open-path eddy flux technique. Temperature, humidity, wind speed, wind direction, rainfall, incoming and reflected shortwave radiation and net radiation are measured above the canopy. Soil heat fluxes are measured and soil moisture content is gathered using time domain reflectometry.",

    "description": "This data release is part of the Federal Government’s Exploring for the Future program undertake by Geoscience Australia in collaboration with the Northern Territory Geological Survey and the Geological Survey of Queensland. It is the second staged release of data from the North Australian Geochemical Survey which sampled catchment outlet sediments at 780 sites (including duplicates) for geochemical analysis.\n\nThe survey area was chosen to encompass the preeminent mineral provinces of Tennant Creek and Mt Isa, with the region between these two provinces providing a vast prospective exploration frontier, covered by a thin veneer of sediments and basalts, which has been overlooked for mineral exploration in the past.\nThe data are not only useful for mineral exploration but also for agriculture and environmental management. For agriculture, this dataset can be used to assess soil fertility to maintain sustainable crop production and inform cattle grazing management over such areas as the Barkly Tablelands. The survey establishes a robust geochemical baseline dataset relevant to many environmental issues which can be utilised in development decision making into the future.\n\nThis data release includes (1) results of the total chemical analyses of the coarse (&lt;2 mm) fraction of sampled sediments (XRF, ICP-MS), (2) results of the aqua regia analyses of the coarse and fine fractions (&lt;2 mm and &lt;75 µm, respectively), and (3) results of the fire assay analysis of the coarse and fine fractions. Included is a set of georeferenced digital images of geochemical maps based on this dataset.",
