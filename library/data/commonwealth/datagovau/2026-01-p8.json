    "description": "Urban Habitat Connectivity Project (UHCP)\n\nShort description: A package of data containing potential habitat and fragmentation for seven species groups in the urban ACT. Each species group has two layer files. Connected habitat layers show potential core and corridor habitat for the species group, and connectivity/fragmentation between these habitat patches. Remnant patches layers contain areas which are predicted to be fragmented and inaccessible for the species group, but may be important for restoration activities. These layers are outputs of ecological connectivity modelling and have been developed using spatial data representing habitat and connectivity requirements specific to the species group.\n\nThe following attributes are available in the data table for Connected Habitat layers:\n\n\n<ul><li>Species Group* - indicates the species group of interest</li><li>Patch ID – a unique identifier for each ‘patch’ of connected habitat, an ID that is given to group all habitat areas which are predicted to be connected to each other.</li><li>Habitat Type* – identifies if the polygon meets core or corridor habitat requirements, or if it is a remnant patch.</li><li>Habitat Number – a numeric value linked to Habitat Type to support statistics and symbology. Core habitat has a value of 0 and corridor habitat has a value of 1.</li><li>Patch Area (Ha)* – the area of the individual polygon in hectares.</li><li>Connected Habitat Area (Ha) – the total area of potential habitat in the connected patch, determined by summing the Patch Area for all polygons with the same Patch ID.</li><li>Shape area – the polygon’s area, calculated by default in meters squared.</li><li>Shape length – the length of the line enclosing the polygon, calculated by default in meters squared.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n* Is also available in the data table for Remnant Patches layers.\n\nSpatial resolution: 1:10,000\n\nCoordinate system: GDA2020 MGA zone 55\n\nMETHODS\n\nData collection / creation: <a>Spatial layers for habitat and barriers were created and input into a habitat connectivity/fragmentation model specifically designed for the species group. The model was developed using metrics derived from expert elicitation. These metrics quantified essential habitat and connectivity requirements for the species group, for example the preferred spacing of trees, the maximum crossable width of a road, the typical dispersal distance, etc. </a>The model identified habitat and barriers to connectivity, based on the metrics which could be mapped. Habitat was delineated by patch size to determine core and corridor habitat, and to remove areas which are too small to be functional. The habitat type is visible in the attribute table of the data.\n\nConnectivity between habitat patches is dependent on the species group’s dispersal capacity and the availability of core habitat, suitable corridors and a path without barriers. To assess this core habitat areas were buffered by the species group’s dispersal distance. This identified how far an individual will move to find a new core habitat patch. Movement to this distance is dependent on a suitable path. All habitat was buffered by the distance the species can move outside habitat (through non-habitat areas). This identified how far an individual will move outside any habitat (core or corridor) before they require another habitat patch (i.e. how far they can travel between stepping stones).Connectivity is further complicated by impassable barriers. Barriers were used to slice up the dispersal buffers and identify ‘dispersal patches’, areas which an individual can move within. Fragmentation is seen when a barrier is present, patches are too far from core habitat, or corridor habitat is too far apart.\n\nA unique ID was applied to each patch and represents connectivity/fragmentation. The patches were intersected with habitat to apply the new ID to the habitat areas. The final model outputs identify areas of potential core, corridor or remnant (inaccessible) habitat. Core and corridor habitat are viewable in the connected habitat dataset, whilst remnant patches are available separately. The data was simplified using the Douglas-Peuker algorithm, a tolerance of 0.5-2m, minimum size of 2-5m2 for retention, and holes filled in if less than 20m2. Small adjoining slithers &lt;20m2 were dissolved into neighbouring polygons to optimise drawing speeds. Please contact the project team for the model script or further details on the methodology.\n\nNOTES ON USE\n\nQuality: The habitat connectivity modelling used to produce the data was informed by work by the City of Melbourne <a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/331035992_Linking_Nature_in_the_City_A_framework_for_improving_ecological_connectivity_across_the_City_of_Melbourne\">(Kirk et al., 2018)</a>. The original methods were expanded on, with habitat and connectivity requirements (metrics) specific to the species group determined from expert elicitation and further analysis to consider patch size for core or corridor patches. The expert elicitation process provided the best and most relevant quantitative description of habitat and barriers available (for a species group rather than a specific species). The input datasets were then tailored to the metrics for this project. Existing datasets were refined to be relevant and reflect the metrics identified through expert elicitation. New datasets were created where data was missing. All data was derived from existing authoritative sources and/or remotely sensed data. This data curation process ensured the input datasets, and resulting output, were relevant and fit for purpose.\n\nLimitations: This data should be considered indicative only as there are limitations to the modelling process. It considers all habitat and barriers equally and as discrete objects (i.e. it applies a discrete boundary around a patch and does not account for gradients or flexible boundaries).The model predicts habitat and connectivity based on the data available. It does not assess whether a species is present or consider temporal variability. Some habitat requirements are not mapped (e.g. native vegetation, lack of predators) due to the lack of an accurate or complete dataset. Some of these requirements are critical to the success of the species group. These habitat requirements are available and have been derived from expert elicitation. They should be considered at an area of interest.\n\nThe model assumes the input data is up to date and accurate. Many of the habitat and barrier datasets used as inputs into the models are in some way informed by remote sensing data. Remote sensing data has limitations, such as potential for misclassification (e.g. bare ground and pavement could be confused). Additionally, remotely sensed data captures a point in time and will become outdated. Manual checks and improvements using supplementary data for specific sites have been completed to reduce as much error as possible.\n\nData refinement: Unmapped habitat and connectivity requirements should be considered when using the data. The full list of known habitat and connectivity requirements for each species group, including those considered by the model and those unaccounted for, is available by request. Other data may also be used to track changes post-LiDAR capture. For example, new development footprints may be used to remove non-habitat areas and can be done so at a faster rate than waiting for new LiDAR captures and re-running the model.\n\n\n\nSHARING\n\nLicenses/restrictions on use: Creative Commons By Attribution 4.0 (Australian Capital Territory)\n\nHow to cite this data: ACT Government, 2023.

    "description": "This dataset is a Digital Elevation Model (DEM) of Heard Island derived by interferometric processing from RADARSAT images acquired on 17 February 2002 and 13 March 2002. The DEM was created by a contractor for the Australian Antarctic Data Centre. The cell size is 10 metres.\r\n\r\nProcessing stages included:\r\n\r\n1 Detection of a coastline from a RADARSAT image of Heard Island acquired 24 January 2002 and rectified using ground control points provided by a second contractor.\r\n\r\n2 Generation of the interferometric SAR (InSAR) DEM using the RADARSAT images acquired on 17 February 2002 and 13 March 2002.\r\n\r\n3 Co-registration of the InSAR DEM with a DEM derived from stereoscopic RADARSAT images acquired in March and April of 1997 and described by the metadata record 'Heard Island RADARSAT (1997) DEM'.\r\n\r\n4 Merging of the InSAR DEM with the 1997 stereoscopic DEM and the coastline detected in stage 1.\r\n\r\nThe following are available for download from the Related URLs below:\r\n\r\n1 The final DEM in ArcInfo interchange or ArcInfo ascii formats.\r\n\r\n2 The rectified RADARSAT image of Heard Island acquired 24 January 2002. Rectified using ground control points and subsequently used in processing of the DEM.\r\n\r\n3 Contours generated from the DEM and the island polygon (coastline) extracted from the rectified RADARSAT image acquired 24 January 2002.\r\n\r\n4 A detailed deport describing the generation of the DEM.\r\n\r\n5 A report by\r\n\r\nDr Arko Lucieer\r\n\r\nCentre for Spatial Information Science\r\n\r\nSchool of Geography and Environmental Studies\r\n\r\nUniversity of Tasmania\r\n\r\nPrivate Bag 76\r\n\r\nHobart 7001\r\n\r\nTasmania, Australia\r\n\r\noutlining some errors and artefacts in the DEM.\r\n\r\nDr Lucieer produced this report while working for the Australian Antarctic Division.\r\n\r\nOn 3 July 2003 Henk Brolsma (Mapping Officer, Australian Antarctic Division)  wrote the following email to the contractor who created the DEM. \"What I'm really interested in are the 20 metre contours for the areas with high coherency. These are the areas where most of the field work takes place and where we have a need for contours with an accuracy better than 50 metres and my reason for using INSAR in the first instance. So can you send me: 1. The 20 metre contours for the areas with high coherency? 2. The zone or line where the INSAR and Stereo Imagery were integrated? This would be very useful for the metadata.\" He did not receive a reply to that email and that was the reason why he was reluctant to make the DEM public. Since he won't now get a reply and the DEM is probably better than the 1997 DEM, he considers the 2002 DEM should now be published.",

    "title": "Benthic cover and fish density on fringing reefs of inshore island groups of the GBR, 1999 – 2014 (NERP 8.2, JCU)",
    "description": "This dataset consists of site and zone means of the percent cover of major benthic categories and the density of fish functional groups on fringing coral reefs of the Keppel, Whitsunday and Palm Island groups, as a result of monitoring surveys carried out between 1999 and 2014. \r\n\r\nThis data extract summarises the results of a long-term monitoring project that assesses the effects of no-take marine reserve zoning in the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park. \r\n\r\nSpatial zoning for multiple-use is the cornerstone of management for the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park (GBRMP). Multiple-use zoning was first implemented widely in the GBRMP in the late 1980’s and this original zoning plan was in place until 2004, when the marine park was completely rezoned under the Representative Areas Program (RAP). The overall proportion of the marine park area assigned into NTRs was increased from around 5% (~ 25% of the coral reefs) to 33.4%. The need to objectively assess the ecological consequences of zoning management has attracted an increasing amount of research effort in recent years.  Critical knowledge gaps still remain however, and research is required to determine how and to what extent NTR networks may help to protect biodiversity, sustain stocks of fished species and increase ecosystem resilience.  \r\n\r\nThis project was established in 1999 and expanded in 2004, with the primary objective of providing a robust assessment of the ecological effects of multiple-use zoning on inshore coral reefs of the GBRMP. The project uses underwater visual census (UVC) to provide a spatially and temporally replicated assessment of fish and benthic communities and will include concurrent surveys of coral health within no-take (Green) and fished (Blue) zones on high-use inshore reefs. It is one of the few long-term monitoring projects specifically assessing the effects of zoning management within the GBRMP and the only one with a solid baseline data set that was established prior to the implementation of the 2004 zoning management plan.\r\n\r\n\r\nMethods:\r\n\r\nUnderwater visual census (UVC) was used to survey reef fish and benthic communities on fringing coral reefs of the Palm, Magnetic, Whitsunday and Keppel Island groups. Within each island group, sites are evenly distributed between zones that have remained open to fishing (General Use and Conservation Park zones), NTRs that were closed to fishing in 1987, and NTRs that were established in 2004 (Marine National Park zones).\r\n\r\nWithin each site UVC surveys were conducted using 5 replicate transects (50m x 6m, 300m2 survey area). Transects were deployed on the reef slope between approximately 4 and 12 metres depth.  Using SCUBA, two observers recorded approximately 190 species of fish from 15 Families (Acanthuridae, Balistidae, Chaetodontidae, Haemulidae, Labridae, Lethrinidae, Lutjanidae, Mullidae, Nemipteridae, Pomacanthidae, Pomacentridae, Scaridae, Serranidae, Siganidae and Zanclidae). A third diver (observer 3) swam directly behind observers one and two, deploying the transect tapes.  This UVC technique reduces diver avoidance or attraction behaviour of the surveyed fish species.  To increase accuracy of the fish counts, the species list was divided between the two fish observers.  Observer one surveyed the fish families Haemulidae, Lethrinidae, Lutjanidae, Mullidae, Nemipteridae, Serranidae and the larger species of Labridae targeted by fishers. Observer two surveyed the families Acanthuridae, Balistidae, Chaetodontidae, Pomacanthidae, Pomacentridae, Scaridae, Siganidae, Zanclidae and small ‘non-targeted’ species of Labridae. Pomacentrids and small labrids were recorded by observer two during return transect swims within a 2m band (1m either side of the tape, 100m2 survey area).  \r\n\r\nBroad-scale structural complexity of the reef habitat was estimated by observer one using a simple method that applied a rank (1-5) to both the angle of the reef slope and the rugosity for each ten-metre section of each transect. Observer three utilised a line intercept survey method to record a benthic point sample every metre along each transect tape (50 samples per transect).Benthos sampled in the benthic survey was live and dead hard coral within morphological categories (branching, plate, solitary, tabular, massive, foliose, encrusting) live soft coral, sponges, clams (Tridacna spp.), other invertebrates (such as ascidians and anemones), macro-algae, coral reef pavement, rock, rubble and sand.\r\n\r\n\r\nLimitations:\r\n\r\nNot all island groups could be surveyed in each year, usually due to funding limitations and unpredictable weather events.\r\n\r\n\r\nFormat:\r\n\r\nThe data are contained within two worksheets of an Excel file (215 kB). All benthic data is in % cover, and fish data are in density (individuals per 1000 m2). The first worksheet shows the data averaged for each site, and the second worksheet has average values for each zone (Fished, NTR 1987 and NTR 2004).\r\n\r\n\r\nData Dictionary:\r\n\r\nNames in rounded brackets () are the matching names in the shapefile. This was done to meet the 10 character limitation of this format.\r\n\r\n- SE - Standard Error\r\n- mean - Mean over the transects at a site.\r\n- Total Fish Densit_mean (TFishDenMn)\r\n- Total Fish Densit_SE (TFishDenSE)\r\n- Fish Species richness_mean (FishRichMn)\r\n- Fish Species richness_SE (FishRichSE)\r\n- Fishery Target Spp_mean (FishTargMn) - Pooled group of fish species designated as 'Primary target’ in the species list file. \r\n- Fishery Target Spp_SE (FishTargSE)\r\n- Grazers_mean (GrazersMn) - Pooled group of fish species listed as ‘grazers’  in the species list\r\n- Grazers_SE (GrazersSE)\r\n- Corallivores_mean (CorallivMn)\r\n- Coraliivores_SE (CorallivSE)\r\n- Planktivores_mean (PlanktivMn)\r\n- Planktivores_SE (PlanktivSE)\r\n- Territorial Pomacentrids_mean (TerrPomaMn)\r\n- Territorial Pomacentrids_SE (TerrPomaSE)\r\n- Plectropomus spp_mean (PlectSppMn)\r\n- Plectropomus spp_SE (PlectSppSE)\r\n- SCI_mean - Structural complexity Index..

    "description": "A Vaisala WXT520 integrated weather station has been installed on RP3, a 6m steel pole, which has been installed within a small bommie in Third Lagoon on One Tree Island as part of the sensor network infrastructure at One Tree Island in the southern Great Barrier Reef off Gladstone, Australia. \n\nThe sensor-relay pole provides a platform for the installation of sensors to measure and monitor water conditions within the lagoon of One Tree Island. The pole has real time communications using 900MHz spread spectrum radio back to a base station on One Tree Island. \n\nThe weather station provides measurement of air temperature (Deg. C.), humidity as relative percent, barometric pressure (milliBars or hPa), rainfall amount, intensity and duration, hail amount, intensity and duration (not common on coral reefs!) and wind speed and direction. The wind speed and direction and processed into scalar and vector (directional) based readings and presented as 10 and 30 minute averages to give mean values and maximum values. From these you can get the average wind conditions at either 10 minute or 30 minute periods as well as the gust or maximum wind conditions. \n\nThe weather station is connected via an SDI-12 interface to a Campbell Scientific CR1000 logger which uses a RF411 radio to transmit the data, every 10 minutes, to the base station on One Tree Island and then a Telstra nextG link is used to send the data back to AIMS.\n\nIdentical weather stations are also on Heron Island (near by), Orpheus Island (central GBR) and Lizard Island (northen GBR). A light sensor is also located on the island itself to give measures of PAR.",

    "title": "Water current readings at the 'Green' mooring in the North West of Jervis Bay: 06/12/88 - 11/01/89",
    "description": "A current meter mooring was deployed in the NW section of Jervis Bay (35.03S, 150.7E) between 6/12/88 and 11/1/89. This mooring held two water current metres: an S4 Interocean current meter at a depth of 5.5m, and an Aanderaa (RCM7) meter at a depth of 9.5m. \n\nEach of these current meters provided two datasets. In the first, the meter integrates the signals over 2 minutes every 10 minutes, providing 10 min sample readings. The second decimated the samples using a running mean to provide hourly intervals. \n\nThe data provided in the datasets includes the eastern and northern tidal components, speed, direction and temperature. The datasets providing the 10 minute sample values also give depth and salinity readings. \n\nThe Aanderaa meter at 9.5m should have provided eastern and northern tidal components over the duration of the sampling period, however the compass jammed and did not work at all. Water speed was recorded but gives no indication of the direction of water movement.\n\n**Unfortunately one dataset is missing from this collection: The decimated hourly intervals for the meter at 9.5m have not been located, and are therefore not provided in this record**\n\nThis is one of four child records that relate to the parent, 06bf0e30-2ae3-11dd-a735-00188b4c0af8. A pdf outlining the structure and hierarchy of all metadata records relating to this project is available to download through this record. Also available is a pdf of a published working paper documenting this experiment and the results.",

    "title": "Benthic cover and fish density on fringing reefs of inshore island groups of the GBR, 1999 ¿ 2014 (NERP 8.2, JCU)",
    "description": "This dataset consists of site and zone means of the percent cover of major benthic categories and the density of fish functional groups on fringing coral reefs of the Keppel, Whitsunday and Palm Island groups, as a result of monitoring surveys carried out between 1999 and 2014. \r\n\r\nThis data extract summarises the results of a long-term monitoring project that assesses the effects of no-take marine reserve zoning in the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park. \r\n\r\nSpatial zoning for multiple-use is the cornerstone of management for the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park (GBRMP). Multiple-use zoning was first implemented widely in the GBRMP in the late 1980¿s and this original zoning plan was in place until 2004, when the marine park was completely rezoned under the Representative Areas Program (RAP). The overall proportion of the marine park area assigned into NTRs was increased from around 5% (~ 25% of the coral reefs) to 33.4%. The need to objectively assess the ecological consequences of zoning management has attracted an increasing amount of research effort in recent years.  Critical knowledge gaps still remain however, and research is required to determine how and to what extent NTR networks may help to protect biodiversity, sustain stocks of fished species and increase ecosystem resilience.  \r\n\r\nThis project was established in 1999 and expanded in 2004, with the primary objective of providing a robust assessment of the ecological effects of multiple-use zoning on inshore coral reefs of the GBRMP. The project uses underwater visual census (UVC) to provide a spatially and temporally replicated assessment of fish and benthic communities and will include concurrent surveys of coral health within no-take (Green) and fished (Blue) zones on high-use inshore reefs. It is one of the few long-term monitoring projects specifically assessing the effects of zoning management within the GBRMP and the only one with a solid baseline data set that was established prior to the implementation of the 2004 zoning management plan.\r\n\r\n\r\nMethods:\r\n\r\nUnderwater visual census (UVC) was used to survey reef fish and benthic communities on fringing coral reefs of the Palm, Magnetic, Whitsunday and Keppel Island groups. Within each island group, sites are evenly distributed between zones that have remained open to fishing (General Use and Conservation Park zones), NTRs that were closed to fishing in 1987, and NTRs that were established in 2004 (Marine National Park zones).\r\n\r\nWithin each site UVC surveys were conducted using 5 replicate transects (50m x 6m, 300m2 survey area). Transects were deployed on the reef slope between approximately 4 and 12 metres depth.  Using SCUBA, two observers recorded approximately 190 species of fish from 15 Families (Acanthuridae, Balistidae, Chaetodontidae, Haemulidae, Labridae, Lethrinidae, Lutjanidae, Mullidae, Nemipteridae, Pomacanthidae, Pomacentridae, Scaridae, Serranidae, Siganidae and Zanclidae). A third diver (observer 3) swam directly behind observers one and two, deploying the transect tapes.  This UVC technique reduces diver avoidance or attraction behaviour of the surveyed fish species.  To increase accuracy of the fish counts, the species list was divided between the two fish observers.  Observer one surveyed the fish families Haemulidae, Lethrinidae, Lutjanidae, Mullidae, Nemipteridae, Serranidae and the larger species of Labridae targeted by fishers. Observer two surveyed the families Acanthuridae, Balistidae, Chaetodontidae, Pomacanthidae, Pomacentridae, Scaridae, Siganidae, Zanclidae and small ¿non-targeted¿ species of Labridae. Pomacentrids and small labrids were recorded by observer two during return transect swims within a 2m band (1m either side of the tape, 100m2 survey area).  \r\n\r\nBroad-scale structural complexity of the reef habitat was estimated by observer one using a simple method that applied a rank (1-5) to both the angle of the reef slope and the rugosity for each ten-metre section of each transect. Observer three utilised a line intercept survey method to record a benthic point sample every metre along each transect tape (50 samples per transect).Benthos sampled in the benthic survey was live and dead hard coral within morphological categories (branching, plate, solitary, tabular, massive, foliose, encrusting) live soft coral, sponges, clams (Tridacna spp.), other invertebrates (such as ascidians and anemones), macro-algae, coral reef pavement, rock, rubble and sand.\r\n\r\n\r\nLimitations:\r\n\r\nNot all island groups could be surveyed in each year, usually due to funding limitations and unpredictable weather events.\r\n\r\n\r\nFormat:\r\n\r\nThe data are contained within two worksheets of an Excel file (215 kB). All benthic data is in % cover, and fish data are in density (individuals per 1000 m2). The first worksheet shows the data averaged for each site, and the second worksheet has average values for each zone (Fished, NTR 1987 and NTR 2004).\r\n\r\n\r\nData Dictionary:\r\n\r\nNames in rounded brackets () are the matching names in the shapefile. This was done to meet the 10 character limitation of this format.\r\n\r\n- SE - Standard Error\r\n- mean - Mean over the transects at a site.\r\n- Total Fish Densit_mean (TFishDenMn)\r\n- Total Fish Densit_SE (TFishDenSE)\r\n- Fish Species richness_mean (FishRichMn)\r\n- Fish Species richness_SE (FishRichSE)\r\n- Fishery Target Spp_mean (FishTargMn) - Pooled group of fish species designated as 'Primary target¿ in the species list file. \r\n- Fishery Target Spp_SE (FishTargSE)\r\n- Grazers_mean (GrazersMn) - Pooled group of fish species listed as ¿grazers¿  in the species list\r\n- Grazers_SE (GrazersSE)\r\n- Corallivores_mean (CorallivMn)\r\n- Coraliivores_SE (CorallivSE)\r\n- Planktivores_mean (PlanktivMn)\r\n- Planktivores_SE (PlanktivSE)\r\n- Territorial Pomacentrids_mean (TerrPomaMn)\r\n- Territorial Pomacentrids_SE (TerrPomaSE)\r\n- Plectropomus spp_mean (PlectSppMn)\r\n- Plectropomus spp_SE (PlectSppSE)\r\n- SCI_mean - Structural complexity Index..

This information will be used to assess and map the vulnerability of biodiversity to the impacts of current and future extreme events in the Wet Tropics bioregion. The information gathered in the Wet Tropics can potentially be applied to other regions in Australia and elsewhere to predict and mitigate the impacts of extreme climatic events on biodiversity. Outcomes will include: Maps of exposure and the sensitivity of organisms to temperature extremes, identification of thermal hotspots and refugia and a list of biodiversity values particularly at risk from extreme events.\n\nThis project is now complete.",

    "description": "    \n\nMean annual (00) and monthly (01a|12) transpiration (mm) from the plant canopy\nfor the period 1980-1999.Interpretation:Canopy transpiration is far more\nspatially variable than potential evaporation, reflecting the effects of water\nlimitation in most areas of the continent. Both the annual mean and seasonal\npattern broadly resemble the corresponding patterns for rainfall. Canopy\ntranspiration maps have more acontrasta (relative variation) than the total\nevaporation or rainfall maps because transpiration is a small component of\ntotal evaporation in areas of low plant cover (the remainder being soil\nevaporation).The partitioning between soil evaporation and canopy\ntranspiration in the model is determined by leaf area index.Notes: These are\nmodel-based estimates from the BiosEquil model. Results are given for the\naBASEa (pre-1788) and aAGRICa (present day) conditions.

    "description": "Tides are measured using a submerged pressure type gauge secured in a heavy concrete mooring in Nella Fjord in the Larsemann Hills near Zhong Shan station.\nTidal records are retrieved from the gauge using an inductive loop lowered through a hole in the ice hence the gauge has been undisturbed since it was deployed.\n  \nDocumentation dated 2001-06-12\nZhong Shan Submerged Tide Gauge\n\nThe gauge used at Zhong Shan was designed in 1991/2 by Platypus Engineering, Hobart, Tasmania.\nIt was intended to be submerged in about 7 metres of water in a purpose made concrete mooring in the shape of a truncated pyramid.\nThe mooring for the Zhong Shan gauge was cast in concrete at Davis and sling loaded by helicopter to Nella Fjord in the Larsemann Hills and deployed through a hole in the ice.\n\nThe gauge measures pressure using a Paroscientific Digiquartz Pressure Transducer with a full scale pressure of 30 psi absolute. The accuracy of the transducer is 1 in 10,000 of full scale over the calibrated temperature range.\nThe overall accuracy of the system is better than +/- 3 mm for a known water density.\nData is retrieved from the gauges by lowering a coil assembly on the end of a cable over a projecting knob on the top of the gauge and by use of an interface unit, a serial connection can be established to the gauge. Time setting and data retrieval can be then achieved.\n\nData has been retrieved from this gauge once since deployment. The records are complete since deployment.\n\nConversion of raw data to tidal records is done as detailed in document: Details of Conversion of Raw Data.\n\nLevelling\nOne attempts has been made at establishing an absolute height for this gauge using timed water level measurements.\n\nDocumentation dated 2008-10-17\nZhong Shan.\nThe battery in the submerged gauge at Zhong Shan has probably been exhausted. The gauge will be removed at an opportune time.\nThe gauge has not recently been download. There will still be some records available.",

    "title": "Wamberal Lagoon Flood Study",
    "description": "Wamberal Lagoon is a small coastal lagoon within the Gosford City and Wyong Council Local\nGovernment areas (Figure 1). The lagoon has a surface area of approximately 0.5 square\nkilometres, and discharges to the Pacific Ocean at Wamberal Beach. The total catchment area\nto the Pacific Ocean is approximately 6.6 square kilometres and thus the area of the lagoon\nrepresents 8% of the total catchment.\n\nA number of properties surrounding the lagoon are very low lying, and flooding in the past has\ncaused damage and disruption. There has not been significant loss of property on any occasion\nin recent years. In an attempt to reduce the flood problems, Council mechanically opens the\nentrance when the lagoon approaches a critical level. This task of opening the lagoon to the\nocean during floods can be both difficult and at times dangerous. The ocean and channel\nentrance conditions appropriate to design flood conditions were therefore major considerations\nin the study.\n\nIn the last 30 years the catchment has changed from a predominantly rural community to a more\nurbanised community. The lagoon and part of the adjoining foreshore have been dedicated as\nthe Wamberal Lagoon Nature Reserve and there has been an increase in population and a\nheightened awareness of environmental issues. These changes have affected the lagoon and\nthere is the potential for further changes. There is a need therefore to define the existing flood\nproblem and carefully manage future development within the catchment and upon the\nfloodplain.\n\nAs the first stage in the development of an overall Floodplain Management Plan for Wamberal\nLagoon, Gosford City Council engaged Webb, McKeown &amp; Associates to prepare a Flood\nStudy.\n\nThe primary objectives of this Flood Study are to:\n<ul>\n<li>determine the flood behaviour of Wamberal Lagoon and its tributaries under existing\nconditions,</li>\n<li>set up a numerical model of the catchment to determine flood flows velocities and\nlevels for design events,</li>\n<li>formulate  the  model  such  that  the  effects  on  flood  behaviour  of  catchment\ndevelopment and flood mitigation options can be investigated.</li>\n</ul>\n\nThe Flood Study does not consider local flooding which may result from inadequate urban\ndrainage provisions. These issues are being examined in other separate studies undertaken\nby Council.\n\nThis report details the results and findings of the Flood Study.  The key elements are:\n<ul>\n<li>a summary of available data,</li>\n<li>reasons for the choice of hydrologic and hydraulic models,</li>\n<li>calibration of these models,</li>\n<li>establishment of design flood behaviour,</li>\n<li>sensitivity analyses of the adopted parameters.</li>\n</ul>\n\nA number of previous studies have been undertaken in the local area. A compilation of all\nrelevant previous reports is contained in Reference 1 and several of these are discussed in\ndetail in Section 2.3. All levels in this Report are to Australian Height Datum (AHD). AHD is the\ncommon national plane approximating mean sea level.",

    "description": "This dataset is a component of the 'Jervis Bay Baseline Studies' project conducted by the Department of Defence, CSIRO and the Australian Defence Force Academy.\n\nThe meteorological station (35.133S, 150.762E) recorded winds and atmospheric pressure at Governor Head (Jervis Bay). The site is several hundred metres inland of 50m high cliffs and is 63m above sea-level.\n\nThis record provides wind statistics for February 1990. Five datasets are included here representing different times of the day: 0000-0545, 0600-1145, 1200-1745 and 1800-2345. Individual measurements have been converted so that trends of wind speed and direction can be seen for the time period in question. The fifth dataset incorporates all the wind data collected irrespective of time providing a monthly summary. The station initially recorded wind data at 15 minute intervals.\n\nThis is one of thirty-six child records that relate to the parent, 629051e0-2b7b-11dd-a343-00188b4c0af8. A pdf outlining the structure and hierarchy of metadata records relating to the 'Jervis Bay Baseline Studies' project is available to download through this record. Meteorological data was collected to investigate wind forced circulation in Jervis Bay, NSW.",

    "description": "This dataset shows mature tree crown polygons across Canberra, Australian Capital Territory (ACT) derived from 2020 LiDAR Canopy Height Model. Mature Tree crowns are defined as those larger than 100m2 canopy footprint, and higher than 8 metres tall. Includes native and non-native tree representation and estimates height. Also see <a href=\"https://actgov.maps.arcgis.com/home/item.html?id=1c62bf7c475748afb1ca5b1ae2239afd\">Mature Tree Centre Points.</a>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<strong>Methods:</strong>\nThe canopy dataset is derived from LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) data captured by Aerometrex and the ACT Government (<a href=\"https://elevation.fsdf.org.au/\">available here</a>) at 12ppm over the ACT and region in April 2020. Tree crowns were delineated using a one metre 2020 LiDAR Canopy Height Model (CHM) via a marker-controlled watershed delineation method (Popescu &amp; Wynn 2004; Plowright &amp; Roussel 2020).A 3X3 low pass smoothing algorithm was applied to the CHM raster. The CHM was then loaded into R and manipulated using the ForestTools R-package (Plowright &amp; Roussel 2020). A variable window filter, which was used in parallel with watershed segmentation, was applied to determine locations of treetops. This algorithm employs a moving window for the CHM to filter pixels, the highest value within the window is regarded as a treetop. The size of the moving window differs and depends on the positive relationship between crown width and tree height. The following metrics was used for the variable window:function(x){((x^2)* 0.009 + 2.5)}. A minimum height of 3 metres was set for the treetop detection algorithm. The resulting dataset, which contained attributes for unique tree identifiers, tree height and moving window size, was saved as a point shapefile. The watershed segmentation method was implemented within the ForestTools R-package to outline tree crowns, using the previously identified treetops as markers. The resulting segmented raster was converted to a simplified polygon layer, and joined with the treetops point layer. Polygons smaller than 3 square metres were removed. Tree crown polygons larger than 100m2 and higher than 8 metres were filtered as &quot;mature trees&quot;. Dataset represents native and non-native species.\n\n\n\n<b>Tree Crown Delineation Method</b>\nThe inverse watershed delineation (IWD) method is the popular technique for segmenting individual tree crowns using LIDAR data (Marcu, et al., 2017) (Wannassiri, et al., 2013). LiDAR-based IWD methods have been successfully applied in conifer-dominated systems, while broadleaf-dominated systems have proven to be more challenging (Hastings, et al., 2020). A common problem with the IWD method is the overestimation of tree crowns, especially in dense tree stands. This problem can be partially overcome by a) aggressively filtering the data, and b) using a variable window filter (VWF) algorithm to detect dominant treetops, which then feeds into the IWD.\nIn this project, 2015 and 2020 tree crowns were delineated from the respective CHM’s, via a marker-controlled watershed delineation method (Popescu &amp; Wynne, 2004) implemented via the ForestTools R-package (Plowright &amp; Roussel, 2021). The R-code used in this project is included in metadata lineage.\nA variable window filter was applied within the ForestTools package to determine locations of treetops. This algorithm employs a variable moving window for the CHM to filter pixels, and the highest value within the window is regarded as a treetop. The size of the moving window differs and depends on the positive relationship between crown width and tree height. The derivation of the appropriate window size to search for treetops is based on the assumption that there is a relationship between the height of the trees and their crown size. The higher the trees, the larger the crown size.\nVarious functions were tested to define the window search radius, including simple linear functions. The function described by Popescu &amp; Wynne was eventually chosen to inform the window search radius of the tree top detection algorithm, as it achieved the best results for mature trees.\nA minimum height of three metres was set for the treetop detection algorithm. The resulting dataset, which contained attributes for unique tree identifiers, tree height and moving window size, was saved as a point shapefile. The IWD method was then implemented within the ForestTools R-package to outline tree crowns, using the previously identified treetops as markers. The resulting raster dataset contained unique identifies corresponding with the tree tops point dataset. The ensuing segmented rasters were converted to polygon layers and joined with the treetops point layers.\n\n<b>Delineated Tree Crown Model Validation</b>\nMap products produced by remote sensing analysis typically uses ‘ground truth’ to determine accuracy. In practice, accuracy assessments evaluate the remote sensing-derived map product relative to some higher quality determination of the map. These higher quality data, referred to as ‘reference data’, is compared to the map product using statistical sampling (Stehman, 2009).\nValidation of the 2015 mature tree crown polygons was done by randomly selecting 40 points from the dataset and checking them against manually digitized crown area polygons (digitized from 2015 aerial photography). The validation showed that the model tended to overestimate the tree canopy area for 32 of the reference polygons, while underestimating the tree canopy area for 8 of the reference polygons. The overestimation of the canopy projective area by the delineation model can be partly attributed to the low pass filter that was used to smooth the canopy height model during the delineation process, which effectively added pixels to the perimeter of tree crowns in the CHM.\nA similar process was followed to validate the 2020 mature tree crown model, using the same 40 randomly selected points and checking them against manually digitized crown area polygons from 2020 aerial photography. The validation showed that the model tended to overestimate the tree canopy area for 33 of the reference polygons, while underestimating the tree canopy area for 7 of the reference polygons.\nAlso see\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://actgov.maps.arcgis.com/home/item.html?id=2f277dfd24964ef3943d99b34c38ebad\">ACTGOV Canopy Cover 2020 1m - Districts - Overview (arcgis.com)</a></li><li><a href=\"https://actgov.maps.arcgis.com/home/item.html?id=2eb04c29f971499aa3aebe4abaa36059\">ACTGOV Canopy Cover 2020 Statistics - Overview (arcgis.com)</a></li></ul>\n\nReferences:\nPlowright, A &amp; J Roussel.

    "description": "**This is a superseded dataset, the current *Forest's of Australia (2023)* dataset can be found at: https://www.agriculture.gov.au/abares/forestsaustralia/forest-data-maps-and-tools/spatial-data.**\r\n\r\nForests of Australia (2013) is a continental dataset of forest extent by national forest types. It was developed from multiple forest, vegetation and land cover spatial datasets, including contributions from relevant Australian, state and territory government agencies and external sources. A forest is defined in this dataset as \"An area, incorporating all living and non-living components, that is dominated by trees having usually a single stem and a mature or potentially mature stand height exceeding two metres and with existing or potential crown cover of overstorey strata about equal to or greater than 20 per cent. This includes Australia's diverse native forests and plantations, regardless of age. It is also sufficiently broad to encompass areas of trees that are sometimes described as woodlands\". \r\n\r\nThe dataset was compiled by the National Forest Inventory (NFI) - a collaborative partnership between the Australian and state and territory governments - whose role is to collate, integrate and communicate information on Australia's forests. State and Territory agencies collect forest data using independent methods and at varying scales or resolutions. The NFI, through the Australian Bureau of Agricultural Resource Economics and Sciences (ABARES), applies a national classification to the states' and territories' data to allow seamless integration. Independent and multiple sources of external data are used to fill data gaps and improve the quality of the final dataset. \r\n\r\nForests of Australia dataset series are produced to fulfil requirements of the Australia's National Forest Policy Statement (NFPS) and the Regional Forests Agreement Act 2002. The dataset is used for domestic and international reporting. ",

The site provides additional features for viewing and interacting with the data and for downloading the data in various formats.</em></strong>  \n\nThis dataset, created in June 2013, provides an indication of the likelihood of a flood occurring from storm tide inside the Brisbane City Council local government area. This layer contributes to the storm tide Flood Awareness Map.\n\nStorm tide flooding happens when a storm surge creates higher than normal sea levels. A storm surge can occur due to a low atmospheric pressure meteorological system and/or strong on-shore winds force sea levels to rise above normal levels among other reasons. Flooding can also occur from king tides. King tides occur throughout the year and are higher than normal tides. Low lying parts of Brisbane and the Bayside suburbs may experience storm tide flooding. Tide affected areas of the river, tidal creeks and other waterways may also be affected.\n\nThere are four different storm tide flooding likelihood areas in Flood Awareness Map, namely High, Medium, Low and very low.\n\nThe storm tide High likelihood layer consists of the current 5% Annual Exceedance Probability (AEP) (20 year Average Recurrence Interval (ARI)) (2.1mAHD) storm tide flood extent.\n\nThe storm tide Medium likelihood layer consists of the current 1% AEP / 100 year ARI (2.5mAHD) storm tide flood extent (outside high likelihood area). \n\nThe storm tide Low likelihood layer consists of the 0.2% AEP / 500 year ARI (2.85mAHD) storm tide flood extent (outside high and medium likelihood areas). \n\nThe storm tide Very Low likelihood consists of the 0.05% AEP / 2000 year ARI (3.2mAHD) storm tide flood extent (outside high, medium and low likelihood areas).",

    "description": "Overview  \r\n ABARES has produced a report containing the results of analysis of beekeeping financial and physical performance data collected from beekeeping businesses in 2015-16. Key performance measures for beekeeping businesses are presented, including analysis of pollination services, use of public lands, challenges facing the beekeeping industry and the extent to which research and information is sought and implemented. \r\n\r\n The report draws on data from the ABARES Australian Honey Bee Industry Survey conducted in 2016. It provides government and industry stakeholders with important data for analysing the current situation of Australian beekeeping businesses, as well as monitoring changes from previous surveys conducted in 2002 and 2008. \r\n\r\n The survey was funded by the Department of Agriculture and Water Resources, as part of the Australian Government's response to a recommendation from the Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport References Committee report from 2014 on the future of the beekeeping and pollination service industries in Australia. \r\n\r\n Key Issues  \r\n• Over 13,000 registered beekeepers operate across Australia. The number of commercial beekeepers fell by 25 per cent over the 10 years to 2015-16. \r\n• Most honey produced came from non-agricultural private land (39 per cent) or public land (39 per cent). 23 per cent was produced from agricultural land. Larger businesses were more likely to derive a greater proportion of total honey produced from public land. \r\n• The majority of beekeeping cash receipts came from honey sales (85 per cent) in 2014-15. Cash receipts from paid pollination were the second largest component of receipts (11 per cent). Business cash income averaged $70 400 and was significantly higher in Tasmania, Victoria and New South Wales. \r\n• Small operators had negative business profit and rate of return in 2014-15, while small-medium, medium and large operators experienced increasingly large positive rates of return and business profit. \r\n• Paid pollination was conducted by around 44 per cent of beekeepers in 2014-15. The proportion of beekeepers and the value of payments received were higher in areas that produced large amounts of bee-pollination dependent crops such as almonds and cherries. \r\n• Drought was the most commonly cited challenge to honey production by beekeepers over the 5 years ending 2014-15 (70 per cent of beekeepers). Half of beekeeping businesses indicated that the use of agricultural chemicals negatively impacted floral resources available and thus their honey production. \r\n• The most common disease and pest affecting beekeepers over the 5 years ending 2014-15 were chalkbrood and the small hive beetle. The greatest financial impacts were caused by the small hive beetle and American foulbrood. \r\n• Nearly three quarters of beekeeping businesses changed their management practices in 2014-15 as a result of research. Large businesses were more responsive to research findings than smaller operators. \r\n",

    "description": "A current meter mooring was deployed in the south central section of Jervis Bay between 10/07/90 and 30/08/90. This 'Red' mooring (35.0872 S, 150.7333 E) held three S4 Interocean current meters at various depths (18.5m, 10.5m and 6.5m). \n\nEach of these current meters provided two datasets. In the first, the meter integrates the signals over 2 minutes every 10 minutes, providing 10 min sample readings. The second decimated the samples using a running mean to provide hourly intervals.  \n\nThe data provided in all these datasets includes the eastern and northern tidal components, speed, direction and temperature. The datasets providing the 10 minute sample values also give depth and salinity readings.\n\n**Unfortunately two datasets are missing from this collection: The decimated hourly intervals for the meter at 6.5m have not been located, as neither have the 10min sample readings for the meter at 10.5m**\n\nThis is one of four child records that relate to the parent, 84d67460-2ae4-11dd-a735-00188b4c0af8. A pdf outlining the structure and hierarchy of all metadata records relating to this project is available to download through this record.

The site provides additional features for viewing and interacting with the data and for downloading the data in various formats.</em></strong>  \n\nThis dataset is a linear representation of where clearways exist along stretches of road in the Brisbane City Council local government area.\n\nClearways improve traffic flow during peak times and improve public safety. You must not set down or pick up passengers in clearways, even when stopped at traffic lights or in traffic.\n\nClearways are also tow away zones. Any vehicle parked in a clearway will be towed as soon as possible. Towed vehicles will also be issued with a parking fine.\n\nSome clearway areas operate only during certain times of the day. The clearway sign will show the times of operation. If there are no times on the sign, the clearway applies 24 hours a day.\n\nAdditional information on parking can be found on the <a href=\"https://www.brisbane.qld.gov.au/traffic-and-transport/parking-in-brisbane\">Brisbane City Council website</a>. More information on clearways can be found on the page called clearway and solid yellows lines on the <a href=\"https://www.brisbane.qld.gov.au/traffic-and-transport/parking-in-brisbane/parking-rules/clearway-and-solid-yellow-lines\">Brisbane City Council website</a>.",

The data is based on the recipient's geocoded address aggregated by Statistical Area Level 2 (SA2) from the Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS) 2016.\nThe Department of Social Services (DSS) is the Australian Government's lead agency in the development and delivery of social policy, and is working to improve the lifetime wellbeing of people and families in Australia. DSS' policies and services respond to need across people's lives - looking after families, children and older people; providing a safety net for people who cannot fully support themselves; enhancing the wellbeing of people with high needs; assisting people who need help with care; and supporting a diverse and harmonious society. DSS supports people and families in Australia by encouraging independence and participation, and supporting a cohesive society.\nFor more information on this dataset please visit the Australian Government Open Data.\nFor further details on payments, see 'A guide to Australian Government payments'.\nPlease note:\n\n\nIn order to protect individuals' privacy, identified populations between 1 and 4 have been suppressed and replaced with '&lt;5' for confidentiality purposes. Additional data may be suppressed and replaced with 'n.p.'

'True' is assigned to fields that have been censored.\n\n\n'n.p.' (not provided) has been set to Null within the data.\n\n",

The processes undertaken to produce this derived dataset are described in the History field in this metadata statement.\n\n\n\nPolygon shapefiles of the component inputs to the South Sydney Basin subregion Prelimnary Assessment Extent (PAE). The Preliminary Assessment Extent (PAE) has been derived from the maximum extents of the input surface water PAE and A 20km buffer around the mine point locations for the South Sydney Basin subregion. These are the shapefiles that represent these component extents.\n\n\n\nFor more information on developing PAEs see M02 Compiling water-dependent assets at http://www.bioregionalassessments.gov.au/submethodology.shtml\n\n## **Dataset History** \n\nThe final PAE  is the result of a UNION (ArcGIS function) of the following polygon areas. This dataset contains the inputs of the UNION as follows:\n\n\n\nA:\n\n\n\nA 20km buffer around the mine point locations for\n\n\n\nAirly (underground)\n\nAngus Place -(underground)\n\nAppin (underground)\n\nClarence (underground)\n\nCullen Valley (underground)\n\nDendrobium (underground)\n\nInvincible (open cut)\n\nPine Dale (open cut)\n\nRussell Vale (underground)\n\nSpringvale (underground)\n\nTahmoor (underground)\n\nWest Cliffe (underground)\n\nWongawilli (underground)\n\n\n\nthat has been clipped to the Sydney Basin bioregion boundary.\n\n\n\nand;\n\n\n\nB: \n\n\n\nA 500m buffer around selected 1:250k Topo streamlines flowing out of the underground mine areas, they being\n\n\n\nAngus Place - (Wolgan River)\n\nAirly - (unnamed)\n\nCullen Valley (unnamed)\n\nSpringvale - (unnamed)\n\nClarence - (Wallangambe River)\n\nAppin/West Cliffe - (Georges River)\n\nDendrobium - (Cordeaux River)\n\nRussell Vale (Cataract River)\n\nTahmoor - (unnamed)\n\nWongawilli - (unnamed)\n\n\n\nThe 20km mine buffer takes in most of the buffered stream areas with the exception of the eastern most sections of the Wolgan and Warrangambe, thus resulting in the snakelike extrusions in the north eastern part of the PAE shapefile and another extending northwest from Cullen Valley beyond the bioregion boundary.\n\n## **Dataset Citation** \n\nBioregional Assessment Programme (2015) SSB Preliminary Assessment Extent inputs v01.

The data at any given time is a combination of information provided from a number of original sources up to 2015, some administrative maintenance, and edits provided through self-management.\nThe original data was collected by Dr Darren Phillips and published in 1996 in paper form. There were various state and city lists maintained as HTML lists by Russ Grayson and Fiona Campbell on the ACFCGN website from 2004-2014. During this period other partial directories were created, including the Tasmanian inventory of school Gardens (~2008), the South Australian Eat Well program (~2010), and the listings of Cultivating Community in the Melbourne area (~2011). These and other lists were combined for the first time in a single database in 2012 by John Brisbin. In 2018 ACFCGN was offered support from AURIN (Australian Urban Research Infrastructure Network) to upgrade the database and annual survey to allow for better access by academics and other researchers.\nFor further information please contact data@communitygarden.org.au (+61 407 471 565)",

Multiple-use zoning was first implemented widely in the GBRMP in the late 1980’s and this original zoning plan was in place until 2004, when the marine park was completely rezoned under the Representative Areas Program (RAP). The overall proportion of the marine park area assigned into NTRs was increased from around 5% (~ 25% of the coral reefs) to 33.4%. The need to objectively assess the ecological consequences of zoning management has attracted an increasing amount of research effort in recent years.  Critical knowledge gaps still remain however, and research is required to determine how and to what extent NTR networks may help to protect biodiversity, sustain stocks of fished species and increase ecosystem resilience.  \r\n\r\nThis project was established in 1999 and expanded in 2004, with the primary objective of providing a robust assessment of the ecological effects of multiple-use zoning on inshore coral reefs of the GBRMP. The project uses underwater visual census (UVC) to provide a spatially and temporally replicated assessment of fish and benthic communities and will include concurrent surveys of coral health within no-take (Green) and fished (Blue) zones on high-use inshore reefs. It is one of the few long-term monitoring projects specifically assessing the effects of zoning management within the GBRMP and the only one with a solid baseline data set that was established prior to the implementation of the 2004 zoning management plan.\r\n\r\n\r\nMethods:\r\n\r\nUnderwater visual census (UVC) was used to survey reef fish and benthic communities on fringing coral reefs of the Palm, Magnetic, Whitsunday and Keppel Island groups. Within each island group, sites are evenly distributed between zones that have remained open to fishing (General Use and Conservation Park zones), NTRs that were closed to fishing in 1987, and NTRs that were established in 2004 (Marine National Park zones).\r\n\r\nWithin each site UVC surveys were conducted using 5 replicate transects (50m x 6m, 300m2 survey area). Transects were deployed on the reef slope between approximately 4 and 12 metres depth.  Using SCUBA, two observers recorded approximately 190 species of fish from 15 Families (Acanthuridae, Balistidae, Chaetodontidae, Haemulidae, Labridae, Lethrinidae, Lutjanidae, Mullidae, Nemipteridae, Pomacanthidae, Pomacentridae, Scaridae, Serranidae, Siganidae and Zanclidae). A third diver (observer 3) swam directly behind observers one and two, deploying the transect tapes.  This UVC technique reduces diver avoidance or attraction behaviour of the surveyed fish species.  To increase accuracy of the fish counts, the species list was divided between the two fish observers.  Observer one surveyed the fish families Haemulidae, Lethrinidae, Lutjanidae, Mullidae, Nemipteridae, Serranidae and the larger species of Labridae targeted by fishers. Observer two surveyed the families Acanthuridae, Balistidae, Chaetodontidae, Pomacanthidae, Pomacentridae, Scaridae, Siganidae, Zanclidae and small ‘non-targeted’ species of Labridae. Pomacentrids and small labrids were recorded by observer two during return transect swims within a 2m band (1m either side of the tape, 100m2 survey area).  \r\n\r\nBroad-scale structural complexity of the reef habitat was estimated by observer one using a simple method that applied a rank (1-5) to both the angle of the reef slope and the rugosity for each ten-metre section of each transect. Observer three utilised a line intercept survey method to record a benthic point sample every metre along each transect tape (50 samples per transect).Benthos sampled in the benthic survey was live and dead hard coral within morphological categories (branching, plate, solitary, tabular, massive, foliose, encrusting) live soft coral, sponges, clams (Tridacna spp.), other invertebrates (such as ascidians and anemones), macro-algae, coral reef pavement, rock, rubble and sand.\r\n\r\n\r\nLimitations:\r\n\r\nNot all island groups could be surveyed in each year, usually due to funding limitations and unpredictable weather events.\r\n\r\n\r\nFormat:\r\n\r\nThe data are contained within two worksheets of an Excel file (215 kB). All benthic data is in % cover, and fish data are in density (individuals per 1000 m2). The first worksheet shows the data averaged for each site, and the second worksheet has average values for each zone (Fished, NTR 1987 and NTR 2004).\r\n\r\n\r\nData Dictionary:\r\n\r\nNames in rounded brackets () are the matching names in the shapefile.

    "description": "A 6m galvanized pole has been deployed in the eastern part of the lagoon in behind Seabird Islet. \n\nThe Relay Pole has three functions. The first is to propagate the wireless network through which the buoys talk and so it forms part of the network backbone talking directly to Relay-Pole 1. The second function is that a vaisala WXT520 weather station is mounted on the top and so this pole provides above water met observations. These include air temperature, humidity, air pressure, wind speed and direction and rainfall.\n\nThe third function is that a sensor string is attached to the pole, the sensor string runs through a channel in Seabird Islet across the exposed seaward reef flat to the reef crest and then down the reef slope to around 20m. This gives a profile down the reef slope and gives readings of the water coming onto the reef complex.\n\nThe pole has two Campbell Scientific loggers (one for the weather station, one for the sensors), spread-spectrum radio and 2.4/5 GHz 802.11 wireless for communicating with the base station (located at the workshop near the Research Station). The sensor string as of August 2010 has a SeaBird SBE37 at the end of the sensor string (around 230m out from the pole), and two SeaBird SBE39's located at teh reef crest and down at the start of the reef slope.\n\nThe unit will be serviced every six months and will be used in the future for attaching new sets of sensors.",

    "description": "\nThe focus of this dataset is the Australian Capital Territory (ACT). It contains digital spatial data developed to assist in land management decision making in the ACT. The dataset contains hazard ratings for land salinity, stream salt load and stream EC as well as overall salinity hazard for each HGL unit. Information about landscape functions and appropriate salinity management strategies are also listed. Hyperlinks to full management descriptions for each HGL unit are provided. The Hydrogeological Landscape (HGL) concept provides a structure for understanding how differences in salinity are expressed across the landscape. A HGL spatially differentiates areas with similar salt stores and pathways for salt mobilisation. The process of delineating a HGL relies on the integration of a number of causative factors: geology, soils, slope, regolith thickness, and climate; an understanding of the different modes of salinity development; and the impacts of salinity within landscapes (land salinity, salt load and salt concentration in streams due to salt contributions from base flow and runoff ). Information sources such as soil landscape maps, site characterisation, salinity occurrence maps, hydrogeological data, surface water and groundwater data are incorporated into standardised unit descriptions.\nFit for purpose: This dataset was captured at 1:25,000 scale. This dataset is fit for use as a tool for assessing land management issues at the paddock-scale in the ACT, but this does not negate the need for site assessment at a scale suitable to any potential land use or development under consideration.  The mapping was mapped in 'GDA1994 MGA Zone 55s' and transformed to GDA2020 MGA Zone 55s.\nCredits: Rob Muller (NSW OEH), Wayne Cook (NSW OEH), Allan Nicholson (NSW DPI), Alie Cowood (UC)\nDisclaimer: While all care is taken to ensure accuracy, the ACT Government does not warrant that the map is free from error.",

    "description": "Urban Habitat Connectivity Project (UHCP)\n\nShort description: A package of data containing potential habitat and fragmentation for seven species groups in the urban ACT. Each species group has two layer files. Connected habitat layers show potential core and corridor habitat for the species group, and connectivity/fragmentation between these habitat patches. Remnant patches layers contain areas which are predicted to be fragmented and inaccessible for the species group, but may be important for restoration activities. These layers are outputs of ecological connectivity modelling and have been developed using spatial data representing habitat and connectivity requirements specific to the species group.\n\nThe following attributes are available in the data table for Connected Habitat layers:\n\n\n<ul><li>Species Group* - indicates the species group of interest</li><li>Patch ID – a unique identifier for each ‘patch’ of connected habitat, an ID that is given to group all habitat areas which are predicted to be connected to each other.</li><li>Habitat Type* – identifies if the polygon meets core or corridor habitat requirements, or if it is a remnant patch.</li><li>Habitat Number – a numeric value linked to Habitat Type to support statistics and symbology. Core habitat has a value of 0 and corridor habitat has a value of 1.</li><li>Patch Area (Ha)* – the area of the individual polygon in hectares.</li><li>Connected Habitat Area (Ha) – the total area of potential habitat in the connected patch, determined by summing the Patch Area for all polygons with the same Patch ID.</li><li>Shape area – the polygon’s area, calculated by default in meters squared.</li><li>Shape length – the length of the line enclosing the polygon, calculated by default in meters squared.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n* Is also available in the data table for Remnant Patches layers.\n\nSpatial resolution: 1:10,000\n\nCoordinate system: GDA2020 MGA zone 55\n\nMETHODS\n\nData collection / creation: <a>Spatial layers for habitat and barriers were created and input into a habitat connectivity/fragmentation model specifically designed for the species group. The model was developed using metrics derived from expert elicitation. These metrics quantified essential habitat and connectivity requirements for the species group, for example the preferred spacing of trees, the maximum crossable width of a road, the typical dispersal distance, etc. </a>The model identified habitat and barriers to connectivity, based on the metrics which could be mapped. Habitat was delineated by patch size to determine core and corridor habitat, and to remove areas which are too small to be functional. The habitat type is visible in the attribute table of the data.\n\nConnectivity between habitat patches is dependent on the species group’s dispersal capacity and the availability of core habitat, suitable corridors and a path without barriers. To assess this core habitat areas were buffered by the species group’s dispersal distance. This identified how far an individual will move to find a new core habitat patch. Movement to this distance is dependent on a suitable path. All habitat was buffered by the distance the species can move outside habitat (through non-habitat areas). This identified how far an individual will move outside any habitat (core or corridor) before they require another habitat patch (i.e. how far they can travel between stepping stones).Connectivity is further complicated by impassable barriers. Barriers were used to slice up the dispersal buffers and identify ‘dispersal patches’, areas which an individual can move within. Fragmentation is seen when a barrier is present, patches are too far from core habitat, or corridor habitat is too far apart.\n\nA unique ID was applied to each patch and represents connectivity/fragmentation. The patches were intersected with habitat to apply the new ID to the habitat areas. The final model outputs identify areas of potential core, corridor or remnant (inaccessible) habitat. Core and corridor habitat are viewable in the connected habitat dataset, whilst remnant patches are available separately. The data was simplified using the Douglas-Peuker algorithm, a tolerance of 0.5-2m, minimum size of 2-5m2 for retention, and holes filled in if less than 20m2. Small adjoining slithers &lt;20m2 were dissolved into neighbouring polygons to optimise drawing speeds. Please contact the project team for the model script or further details on the methodology.\n\nNOTES ON USE\n\nQuality: The habitat connectivity modelling used to produce the data was informed by work by the City of Melbourne <a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/331035992_Linking_Nature_in_the_City_A_framework_for_improving_ecological_connectivity_across_the_City_of_Melbourne\">(Kirk et al., 2018)</a>. The original methods were expanded on, with habitat and connectivity requirements (metrics) specific to the species group determined from expert elicitation and further analysis to consider patch size for core or corridor patches. The expert elicitation process provided the best and most relevant quantitative description of habitat and barriers available (for a species group rather than a specific species). The input datasets were then tailored to the metrics for this project. Existing datasets were refined to be relevant and reflect the metrics identified through expert elicitation. New datasets were created where data was missing. All data was derived from existing authoritative sources and/or remotely sensed data. This data curation process ensured the input datasets, and resulting output, were relevant and fit for purpose.\n\nLimitations: This data should be considered indicative only as there are limitations to the modelling process. It considers all habitat and barriers equally and as discrete objects (i.e. it applies a discrete boundary around a patch and does not account for gradients or flexible boundaries).The model predicts habitat and connectivity based on the data available. It does not assess whether a species is present or consider temporal variability. Some habitat requirements are not mapped (e.g. native vegetation, lack of predators) due to the lack of an accurate or complete dataset. Some of these requirements are critical to the success of the species group. These habitat requirements are available and have been derived from expert elicitation. They should be considered at an area of interest.\n\nThe model assumes the input data is up to date and accurate. Many of the habitat and barrier datasets used as inputs into the models are in some way informed by remote sensing data. Remote sensing data has limitations, such as potential for misclassification (e.g. bare ground and pavement could be confused). Additionally, remotely sensed data captures a point in time and will become outdated. Manual checks and improvements using supplementary data for specific sites have been completed to reduce as much error as possible.\n\nData refinement: Unmapped habitat and connectivity requirements should be considered when using the data. The full list of known habitat and connectivity requirements for each species group, including those considered by the model and those unaccounted for, is available by request. Other data may also be used to track changes post-LiDAR capture. For example, new development footprints may be used to remove non-habitat areas and can be done so at a faster rate than waiting for new LiDAR captures and re-running the model.\n\n\n\nSHARING\n\nLicenses/restrictions on use: Creative Commons By Attribution 4.0 (Australian Capital Territory)\n\nHow to cite this data: ACT Government, 2023.

    "description": "This dataset presents counts of payment recipients by payment type for the quarter ending June 2016. The data is based on the recipient's geocoded address aggregated by Statistical Area Level 2 (SA2) from the Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS) 2011.\nThe Department of Social Services (DSS) is the Australian Government's lead agency in the development and delivery of social policy, and is working to improve the lifetime wellbeing of people and families in Australia. DSS' policies and services respond to need across people's lives - looking after families, children and older people; providing a safety net for people who cannot fully support themselves; enhancing the wellbeing of people with high needs; assisting people who need help with care; and supporting a diverse and harmonious society. DSS supports people and families in Australia by encouraging independence and participation, and supporting a cohesive society.\nFor more information on this dataset please visit the Australian Government Open Data.\nFor further details on payments, see 'A guide to Australian Government payments'.\nPlease note:\n\n\nIn order to protect individuals' privacy, identified populations between 1 and 19 have been suppressed and replaced with '&lt;20' for confidentiality purposes. Additional data may be suppressed and replaced with 'n.p.' (not provided) to prevent the derivation of identified populations that have values of less than 20.\n\n\nCaveats specific to payments type can be found in the relevant payment description of the original data.\n\n\nAURIN has spatialised this dataset and have made the following replacements to enforce data type consistency: \n\n\n'&lt;20' has been assigned a value of '-1' within the data\n\n\nA boolean field has been created for each data field to flag left-censored data. 'True' is assigned to fields that have been censored.\n\n\n'n.p.' (not provided) has been set to Null within the data.\n\n",

While the datasets remain accessible, they may no longer be fully functional, and are currently under review.\n\nThe <a href=\"https://www.bnefoodtrucks.com.au\">Brisbane Food Trucks website</a> is a one-stop-shop for gourmet food trucks. The website allows food truck operators to create profiles, upload menu information and take advantage of GPS technology to enable customers to track their location.\n\nTo help third parties promote Brisbane Food Trucks, we have enabled a data API.

    "description": "This dataset consists of daily estimates of photic depth on the Great Barrier Reef from MODIS satellite imagery (from 2002 - 2015) using a quasi-analytical algorithm. This algorithm is based on a Type II linear regression of log-transformed satellite and in situ data (2002- 2012).\r\n\r\nThis algorithm was developed as part of data delivery for several NERP projects and was implemented into the NASA SeaDAS tool for processing MODIS imagery. This algorithm and its data products are now routinely run by the Bureau of Meteorology as part of the eReefs Water Quality Dashboard.\r\n\r\nThe data produced from this algorithm were key input datasets for the analysis of NERP TE project 4.1 and integrated as part of the NERP TE 2.3 GBR/TS environmental conditions reports.\r\n\r\n\r\nMethod:\r\n\r\nThe satellite imagery was first broken down into its estimated Inherent Optical Properties (IOP) using a quasi-analytical algorithm, outlined in [1]. This process converts the multi-spectral satellite images into an estimate of the various optical properties of the water such as backscattering and absorption of the water. The IOPs were then used to estimate the depth where 10% of the surface light (PAR) level was still available (Z10%). \r\nA regression of the in situ ZSD (secchi depth) values against the matching satellite estimates of Z10% was used to adjust the satellite-derived Z10% to ZSD. A Type II linear regression (RMA) of log-transformed satellite and in situ data was used to estimate ZSD for the GBR according to: \r\nZSD = 10^[{log10 (Z10%) - a0}/a1]\r\nwhere a0 and a1 are 0.529 and 0.816 for MODIS-Aqua (N = 71; r2 = 0.83; RMSE = 0.096).\r\n\r\nThe regional tuning parameters a0 and a1 were determined by regression between satellite and in-situ secchi depth measurements from AIMS and QDPI.\r\n\r\nMore details about the methods used to create this dataset can be found in [2].\r\n\r\n\r\nFormat:\r\n\r\nThis data is available in NetCDF raster format from the BOM Marine Water Quality THREDDS server. This server also makes the data available various formats from the following services: OpenDAP, WMS and WCS.\r\nhttp://ereeftds.bom.gov.au/ereefs/tds/catalogs/ereefs_data.html\r\n\r\nThe data for this dataset is available in the mwq P1D Aggregation, mwq P1W Aggregation, mwq P1M Aggregation, mwq P6M Aggregation, mwq P1A Aggregation service end points. These correspond to daily and weekly, monthly, 6 monthly and annual aggregates respectively. The secchi depth estimates correspond to the SD_MIM_* data layers in the service end points.\r\n\r\n\r\nReferences:\r\n\r\n1. Lee, Z.; Carder, K.L.; Arnone, R.A.

    "description": "The record describes data collected from a summer deployment of an Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler (ADCP) moored in the central part of Jervis Bay, New South Wales (35o 05'S, 150o 44'E). An ADCP measures how fast water is moving across an entire water column. Anchored to the seafloor it can measure current speed not just at the bottom, but also at equal intervals all the way up to the surface. For this experiment, the ADCP was moored on the seabed, in a frame, with sensors looking upwards and approximately 0.5m above the seabed. \n\nOver the summer deployment, 13th December 1990 to 15th January 1991, the ADCP was set-up with a 15 minute sampling interval and currents were measured over 1m depth bins. Bin numbers and currents are referenced as a height above the seabed (due to the uncertainty in defining water depth because of tides and air pressure). As such Bin #1 is centered at 1.5m above the transducer face or 2.0m above the seabed. Bin #2 is centered at 3m above the seabed, Bin #3 at 4m and so on.  \n\nThree resources are provided: 1) A schematic of depth bin locations for the summer deployment, 2) Unfiltered east/west and north/south current values for every 15 minutes of the experiment, and 3) Low-pass filtered east/west and north/south hourly current values to remove tidal period motion. The filter has a half amplitude response at 32 hours and 48 hourly weights.\n\nThis child record relates to the parent, b146e140-2ae6-11dd-a735-00188b4c0af8. A pdf outlining the structure and hierarchy of all metadata records relating to this project is available to download through this record. Also available is a pdf of a published working paper documenting this experiment and the results.",

    "description": "This dataset is a component of the 'Jervis Bay Baseline Studies' project conducted by the Department of Defence, CSIRO and the Australian Defence Force Academy.\n\nThe meteorological station (35.133S, 150.762E) recorded winds and atmospheric pressure at Governor Head (Jervis Bay). The site is several hundred metres inland of 50m high cliffs and is 63m above sea-level.\n\nThis record provides wind statistics for August 1989. Five datasets are included here representing different times of the day: 0000-0550, 0600-1150, 1200-1750 and 1800-2350. Individual measurements have been converted so that trends of wind speed and direction can be seen for the time period in question. The fifth dataset incorporates all the wind data collected irrespective of time providing a monthly summary. The station initially recorded wind data at 10 minute intervals.\n\nThis is one of thirty-six child records that relate to the parent, 629051e0-2b7b-11dd-a343-00188b4c0af8. A pdf outlining the structure and hierarchy of metadata records relating to the 'Jervis Bay Baseline Studies' project is available to download through this record. Meteorological data was collected to investigate wind forced circulation in Jervis Bay, NSW.",

Using a 4-tiered hierarchical classification, the datasets show where land is owned, leased, reserved or unallocated to a defined purpose in Australia. The datasets were constructed by combining jurisdictional land title information from digital cadastral databases or their equivalents with Indigenous land grant instruments areas. The data package contains for each of the 3 time periods an independent raster and data caveat raster of known uncertainties in the product, plus 4 combined change rasters. The 5-yearly data is at a resolution of 250 by 250 metres.\r\nThe Land tenure of Australia 2010–11 to 2020–21 data package is a product of the Australian Collaborative Land Use and Management Program.

    "description": "Overview  \r\nAustralia's plantation log supply 2015-2059 report presents forecasts of sawlog and pulplog volumes available from softwood and hardwood plantations. Changes in log availability have important implications for Australia's rural economies; the size, type and geographical location of wood and paper product manufacturing industries; the national supply of wood products; Australia's trade balance; and Australia's export income. \r\n\r\n This report has been prepared by ABARES under the auspices of the National Plantation Inventory--a program that has collected data and reported on plantations established primarily for wood production in Australia since 1993. Comprehensive plantation log availability forecast reports are published every five years and Australia's plantation log supply 2015-2059 is the fifth log supply report. \r\n\r\n In this report, forecasts are presented for softwood and hardwood sawlog and pulplog volumes by National Plantation Inventory region, based on the combination of forecasts supplied by plantation owners and managers through a survey and ABARES modelled forecasts. For the modelled forecasts, ABARES did not account for any future changes in social, economic or environmental parameters. \r\n\r\n Key Points  \r\n• The potential log availability from Australia's commercial plantation estate is forecast to increase to an annual average of 29.7 million cubic metres in the 2015-19 period, followed by a decline to an annual average of 27.0 million cubic metres a year for the 2020-24 period. The 2015 to 2059 average total plantation log availability forecast is 10 per cent lower in this report, compared with the 2012 log supply report; the average hardwood log availability forecast is 21 per cent lower and the average softwood log availability forecast is 2 per cent lower. \r\n• The majority of the decline in total log availability is because the expected yield from hardwood plantations is forecast to decline as plantations of low commerciality are not replanted and some lease agreements with landholders are not renewed. \r\n• ABARES estimates that the total commercial plantation estate may decrease by around 80 000 to 100 000 hectares over the next 10 to 15 years as new plantation establishment will not be sufficient to offset removals of low commerciality plantations unless there are new drivers to expand or maintain the current plantation estate. \r\n",

    "description": "\n\n\nACT Climate refugia are core areas of the landscape most likely to support persistence of dominant trees, shrubs and grasses of the Capital Region under climate change.\nThe data identify refugia expected to support climate sensitive species characteristic of each vegetation community, both now and into the future, based on distribution modelling using NARCLiM climate projections (MacKenzie et al 2019).\nThe areas shown (refugia) highlight where the most stressed subset of dominant plant species today (i.e., common trees, shrubs and grasses modelled to lose &gt;= 75% of their current distribution) are more likely to persist under a wide range of future climate scenarios. These refugia can be used to prioritise management actions to minimise further stresses to those communities (e.g. prescribed burning within tolerable fire intervals; climate-adaptive revegetation programs, etc). Note: Areas smaller than 0.5 hectares have been removed to enable quicker map drawing, contact officeofnatureconservation@act.gov.au for the full dataset, including ensemble forecasts for individual plant species (n=151).\nSource Technical Report:\nMacKenzie, J.B., G.

    "description": "\n\n\nHabitat Patches: The patches have been identified through use of an effective habitat area analysis. This analysis reflects the generalist habitat condition assigned to every 15m grid cell across the ACT region and the context or combined habitat values of the grids that surround it or are in its near vicinity. Patches are defined by polygons that include all adjoining grid cells that are in the highest 20% for spatial context for all grid cells across the ACT Region. The legend indicates patches that are &gt;10ha or that are from 5 – 10 ha.  Indicates resource availability for an animal at that cell.\nThe ACT connectivity mapping was undertaken by the NSW Office of Environment and Heritage. A full study report has been produced, and is entitled Fine Scale Modelling of Fauna Habitat and Connectivity Values in the ACT Region. This study built upon an earlier report entitled the Ecological Connectivity for Climate Change in the ACT and surrounding region, commissioned by the ACT Government as part of Weathering the Change Action Plan 1. The report was undertaken by the Fenner School of Environment and Society, Australian National University. It is recommended that both reports be consulted when use is being made of the connectivity mapping available. Reports can be downloaded from the EPD website at https://www.act.gov.au/environment/research-and-data/conservation-research-and-technical-reports (Technical reports 21 and 27).\ngen_blank20pc_ctx \nGridcode\n0 = &lt;10ha\n1 = &gt;10ha\nPatchcode\n-1= Not a patch\n0= Patch 5-10ha\n1= Patch 10ha&lt;\nUpdates: This dataset is static.\nFit for purpose: 2012 temporal coverage. This dataset should be used as a modelled tool for aiding landuse, strategic town planning, and conservation planning in the ACT including revegetation targets and informing environmental impacts of infrastructure and building projects. Cell size 15x15m.\nDisclaimer: While all care is taken to ensure accuracy, the ACT Government does not warrant that the map is free from errors.",

The data is based on the recipient's geocoded address aggregated by Statistical Area Level 2 (SA2) from the Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS) 2016.\nThe Department of Social Services (DSS) is the Australian Government's lead agency in the development and delivery of social policy, and is working to improve the lifetime wellbeing of people and families in Australia. DSS' policies and services respond to need across people's lives - looking after families, children and older people; providing a safety net for people who cannot fully support themselves; enhancing the wellbeing of people with high needs; assisting people who need help with care; and supporting a diverse and harmonious society. DSS supports people and families in Australia by encouraging independence and participation, and supporting a cohesive society.\nFor more information on this dataset please visit the Australian Government Open Data.\nFor further details on payments, see 'A guide to Australian Government payments'.\nPlease note:\n\n\nIn order to protect individuals' privacy, identified populations between 1 and 4 have been suppressed and replaced with '&lt;5' for confidentiality purposes. Additional data may be suppressed and replaced with 'n.p.' (not provided) to prevent the derivation of identified populations that have values of less than 5.\n\n\nCaveats specific to payments type can be found in the relevant payment description of the original data.\n\n\nAURIN has spatialised this dataset and have made the following replacements to enforce data type consistency: \n\n\n'&lt;5' has been assigned a value of '-1' within the data\n\n\nA boolean field has been created for each data field to flag left-censored data. 'True' is assigned to fields that have been censored.\n\n\n'n.p.' (not provided) has been set to Null within the data.\n\n",

    "description": "This dataset presents counts of payment recipients by payment type for the quarter ending September 2016. The data is based on the recipient's geocoded address aggregated by Statistical Area Level 2 (SA2) from the Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS) 2011.\nThe Department of Social Services (DSS) is the Australian Government's lead agency in the development and delivery of social policy, and is working to improve the lifetime wellbeing of people and families in Australia. DSS' policies and services respond to need across people's lives - looking after families, children and older people; providing a safety net for people who cannot fully support themselves; enhancing the wellbeing of people with high needs; assisting people who need help with care; and supporting a diverse and harmonious society. DSS supports people and families in Australia by encouraging independence and participation, and supporting a cohesive society.\nFor more information on this dataset please visit the Australian Government Open Data.\nFor further details on payments, see 'A guide to Australian Government payments'.\nPlease note:\n\n\nIn order to protect individuals' privacy, identified populations between 1 and 19 have been suppressed and replaced with '&lt;20' for confidentiality purposes. Additional data may be suppressed and replaced with 'n.p.' (not provided) to prevent the derivation of identified populations that have values of less than 20.\n\n\nCaveats specific to payments type can be found in the relevant payment description of the original data.\n\n\nAURIN has spatialised this dataset and have made the following replacements to enforce data type consistency: \n\n\n'&lt;20' has been assigned a value of '-1' within the data\n\n\nA boolean field has been created for each data field to flag left-censored data. 'True' is assigned to fields that have been censored.\n\n\n'n.p.' (not provided) has been set to Null within the data.\n\n",

    "description": "Study Area\n\nThe study area is located in south west Sydney at the northern end of the suburbs of Revesby and\nPadstow. It is an urban catchment that drains in an easterly direction through a stormwater pipe and\nopen channel network to Salt Pan Creek, a tributary of the Georges River. The catchment includes\nthe South Western Motorway (M5) east from approximately Queen Street to Salt Pan Creek. The\nRiver Road, Gibson Avenue and Fairford Road cross the catchment (and the motorway via\noverpasses) in approximately a north-south direction. The Fairford Road catchment is wholly within\nthe Bankstown City local government area (LGA).\n\nOutcomes from the Study\n\nThe main outcomes from this study include:\n<ul>\n<li>A database of all Council drainage assets within the study area;</li>\n<li>Establishment of a computer model capable of assessing flood behaviour;</li>\n<li>Information on flood behaviour under existing catchment conditions;</li>\n<li>Predicted change in flood levels due to the potential impacts of climate change; and</li>\n<li>A model that can be used to assess flood mitigation options and future development proposals.</li>\n</ul>\n\nDatabase of Drainage Assets\n\nAll drainage asset data collected by Council for the study has been incorporated into a GIS database.\n\nThis allows the data to be spatially represented across the study area and easily retrieved as\nrequired. Information in the database includes data for some 240 Council stormwater pits and 310\nstormwater drainage pipes.\n\nOther catchment data, including aerial photography, property cadastre, building footprints and the\nterrain surface (based on ALS survey) is also incorporated into a GIS database.\n\nComputer Modelling\n\nA numerical computer model was developed for the catchment to simulate flood behaviour, using the\nsoftware TUFLOW. Surface flows are represented in the model through a two-dimensional grid\ncovering the entire study area. The stormwater pit and pipe network is included as one-dimensional\nelements within this grid. Full details of the modelling approach, modelling parameters and other\nassumptions are outlined in the Fairford Road Catchment Flood Modelling Report, which is included\nas Appendix C.\n\nExisting Flood Behaviour\n\nDesign flood behaviour has been computed for a range of floods, ranging from relatively frequent\nevents to more extreme floods.\nThe model produces a grid of results over the study area providing data on flood levels, flood depths\nand flood velocities. Flood level contours have also been prepared showing contours of flood heights\nthroughout the study area. This data is provided digitally and can be overlaid on base mapping such\nas aerial photos and cadastral plans showing property boundaries.\n\nAll flood model results have been provided to Council for incorporation into their GIS database. Much\nof this information is also included as A4 sized plans included in Appendix C.\nIt is understood that once the Flood Study has been adopted by Council, the GIS information\nresulting from this Flood Study will be used for floodplain management purposes, including\nassessment of flood-related development constraints on properties. Potential flood mitigation options\nwill be assessed in the subsequent Floodplain Risk Management Study phase of the floodplain risk\nmanagement process.",

    "description": "    \n\nMean annual (00) and monthly (01a|12) transpiration (mm) from the plant canopy\nfor the period 1980-1999.Interpretation:Canopy transpiration is far more\nspatially variable than potential evaporation, reflecting the effects of water\nlimitation in most areas of the continent. Both the annual mean and seasonal\npattern broadly resemble the corresponding patterns for rainfall. Canopy\ntranspiration maps have more acontrasta (relative variation) than the total\nevaporation or rainfall maps because transpiration is a small component of\ntotal evaporation in areas of low plant cover (the remainder being soil\nevaporation).The partitioning between soil evaporation and canopy\ntranspiration in the model is determined by leaf area index.Notes: These are\nmodel-based estimates from the BiosEquil model. Results are given for the\naBASEa (pre-1788) and aAGRICa (present day) conditions.

    "description": "Lizard Island is located in the Northern Great Barrier Reef province, approximately 270km north of Cairns. Reef drilling was undertaken to investigate the Holocene evolution of the fringing reefs of Lizard Island. Radiocarbon dating of the cored coral material was then used to establish the chronology of the reef and to quantify the rate of development. \n\nThree drill cores were extracted, all from the windward margin because the leeward margin was too deep to access and did not form a conventional reef flat margin. The maximum depth reached was 4.5 m in core L1, with cores L2 and L3 being abandoned after encountering thick sand layers. \n\nThe cores were logged and photographed, and thin sections were made and petrographically examined. Corals that were determined to be in situ (by the orientation of their corallites) and free from internal cement and detritus by microscope examination were selected for radiocarbon dating.\n\nRadiocarbon dates indicate that the fringing reef at Lizard Island started growing directly on an assumed granite basement approximately 6.7 cal kyr BP at approximately 4.5 m below the reef flat surface. The windward margin at Lizard Island approached modern day sea level approximately 4 cal kyr BP. Rates of vertical accretion ranged from 0.5 to 0.7 m/kyr at Lizard Island.",

    "description": "The data for this map were collected as part of two ASAC projects - 488 and 956, of which Patricia Selkirk was the chief investigator. Macquarie Island (54 degrees S 159 degrees E) is a subantarctic island (c. 35km by 3 to 5km) approximately equidistant between Tasmania, New Zealand and Antarctica in the Southern Ocean. The vegetation is herbaceous, lacking shrubs and trees. Vegetation and drainage are mapped at a scale of 1:25 000 from field observations, satellite imagery and limited oblique and aerial photography. The categories adopted for mapping vegetation are based on attributes of foliage height and percentage foliage cover of the ground surface (vegetation structure), not on species distribution (floristics). The distribution of vegetation categories is strongly correlated with aspect, topography and rock type. Mires, streams and lakes form an intricate drainage pattern that is strongly influenced by the geology of this tectonically active emergent crest of the submarine Macquarie Ridge at the boundary of the Pacific and Australian plates. The drainage pattern of the whole island is represented in a map with substantially greater accuracy than in any previous map.",

    "title": "Derelict fishing line on fringing reefs of inshore groups of the GBR, 2007-2009 (NERP 8.2, JCU)",
    "description": "This dataset consists of site means of the density of derelict fishing line, the percent cover of major benthic categories on fringing coral reefs of the Keppel, Whitsunday and Palm Island groups, and the accumulation rate of fishing line at ten sites in the Palm Islands between 2007 and 2009. \r\n\r\nMonofilament nylon fishing line is persistent in the marine environment and once entangled in the reef, it can remain in place for many years. Temporal monitoring of the relative number of fishing lines recorded at each site can be used as a proxy for fishing effort. During the last few years we have established a collaboration with ReefCheck Australia to enhance this aspect of the project. In 2007, volunteer divers were tasked with removing all derelict fishing lines from a subset of the monitoring sites in the Palm Islands.  In the last few years, the rate of line re-accumulation has been monitored to gauge relative levels of fishing effort and zoning compliance. \r\n\r\n\r\nMethods:\r\n\r\nUnderwater visual census (UVC) was used to survey derelict fishing lines at 30 sites in the Palm Islands, 42 sites in the Whitsunday Islands and 22 sites in the Keppel Islands during 2009.  Within each island group, half of the sites (n = 47) were located on reefs within NTMRs and half  (n = 47) were on reefs that are open to fishing (non-NTMR).  A proportion of the NTMR sites in each island group were located within ¿old¿ reserves (NTMR 1987) protected since 1987; while others were located within ¿new¿ reserves (NTMR 2004) protected since 2004.\r\n\r\nFive replicate 50 m x 6 m (300 m²) UVC transects were surveyed at each monitoring site by two observers using SCUBA.  The total survey area at each site was 1500 m2.  Transect tapes were deployed along reef slopes, parallel to the reef crest and at a depth between 4 m and 9 m depending on the reef slope topography at each site.\r\nThe benthic community was surveyed using a standard line intercept survey method every 1 m along each transect (50 points per transect). Hard corals were classified as live or dead and assigned into morphological categories (branching, digitate, plate, massive, foliose, encrusting). Other categories of benthos included soft coral, sponges, clams (Tridacna spp.), other invertebrates (such as ascidians and anemones), macro-algae, coral reef pavement, rock, rubble and sand. Reef structural complexity was estimated using a five-point scale for both reef slope angle and rugosity. Five independent structural complexity estimates were made for each transect. Underwater visibility was recorded on each transect and ranged from 6 m to 12 m. Surveys did not proceed if the visibility was less than 5 m.\r\n\r\nTeams of volunteer divers from Reef Check Australia carried out the removal of derelict fishing lines at ten of the monitoring sites in the Palm Islands during April 2007. Five of the cleaned sites were located on reefs within NTMRs and five were on non-NTMR reefs. Four of the cleaned NTMR sites were located on the leeward side of Orpheus Island (NTMR 1987) and one site was at Curacoa Island (NTMR 2004). Of the cleaned non-NTMR sites, four were located on the leeward side of Pelorus Island and one was at Curacoa Island. The ten cleaned sites were randomly selected from a pool of eighteen sites that were in sheltered (leeward) locations and were identified as being readily accessible by fishers during calm to moderate (< 15 knots of wind) weather conditions. \r\n\r\nAt each site, divers removed all sighted derelict fishing lines and tackle (hooks, sinkers, wire leaders etc.) on reef slopes between 4 m and 12 m depth, for 200 m in both directions from a central GPS waypoint marking the site position. Transect tapes were deployed to measure the distance covered and increase the search efficiency so that very few, if any, derelict fishing lines remained after cleanup operations were completed. Derelict lines that were overgrown with hard coral or encrusting sponges, or partially embedded in the reef matrix were cut, and all of the exposed (visible) sections of line were removed. All collected fishing lines were recorded on data sheets before being placed in catch bags and taken back to the boat for later disposal.  \r\n\r\nBaseline UVC surveys of derelict fishing lines were conducted at each of the ten cleaned sites immediately prior to the removal of fishing lines in April 2007 and UVC surveys were subsequently repeated in December 2009, providing a 32 month period for fishing lines to re-accumulate on the reefs.  The 2007 and 2009 UVC surveys on the 10 cleaned sites used the same methodology described in the survey methods section above.  \r\n\r\nWe assumed that all of the fishing lines recorded and collected were lost at the same location in which they were found.  The authors recognize that the removal of derelict fishing line from ten of the thirty sites in the Palm Islands prior to the 2009 surveys would have reduced the fishing line density estimates for the Palm Islands.  However the magnitude of this effect was balanced between old and new NTMRs and non-NTMRs, as only one-third of the monitoring sites in each zone were cleaned.\r\n\r\n\r\nFormat:\r\n\r\nThe data are contained within two worksheets of an Excel file (20 kB). All benthic data is in % cover. Fishing line data are presented as both mean density (mean number of lines per 300 m2) and a total summed value for each site (total number of lines recorded per 1500m2). The first worksheet provides the site-level data for 2009. The second worksheet provides the accumulation rates of fishing lines at 10 monitoring sites in the Palm Islands between their removal in 2007 and the re-survey in 2009.\r\n\r\n\r\nData Dictionary:\r\n\r\nNames in brackets correspond to those used in the shapefile equivalents of the spreadsheet data. These names were adapted to work within the 10 character attribute limitation of shapefiles.\r\n- Fish Line_MEAN (FishLineMn) - mean number of lines recorded over 5 transects surveyed at each 300 m2 site.\r\n- Fish Line_SUM (FishLinSum) - is the pooled number of lines recorded on the 5 transects surveyed at each site. It is the total number of lines found over the 1500m2 surveyed at each site.\r\n- Line Accumulation Rate (LineAccRat) - number of lines accumulated per month.\r\n- SCI_MEAN - Structural complexity Index.. An index (1-25) calculated by multiplying our visual estimates of reef slope angle (1-5) by reef slope rugosity (Complexity 1-5). These values are estimated for each 10m section of each 50m transect. 5 transects per site = 25 SCI estimates per site. The data provided is site means¿ i.e. the mean of those 25 values.\r\n- %LHC_MEAN (LHC_MEAN) - Live hard coral cover (%), live hard coral only.  \r\n\r\n\r\nReferences:\r\n\r\nWilliamson D.H., Ceccarelli D.M., Evans R.D., Hill J.K., Russ G.R.

The dataset comprises of a digital point coverage of glacial sediments, collected and identified from documented field observations compiled by Dr Ian D Goodwin from his own field notes as well as topographic and surface features identified and interpreted on aerial photographs taken by AUSLIG (now Geoscience Australia) in the 1993-94 field season. Each marine incursion sediment sample is represented as a point which is linked to a separate digital database (ie attribute tables) containing additional information. Sediment samples collected predominantly along the shoreline of these lakes represent a chronology of glacial events/influences on these lakes. Sediment samples taken as a profiled sequence or core can be dated using radiocarbon dating to provide a chronological picture and age occurance of deglaciation and glaciation cycles within the  Windmill Islands.",

    "description": "\n## **Abstract** \nThe dataset was compiled by the Geological and Bioregional Assessment Program from source data referenced within the dataset and/or metadata. New sinkhole and waterhole data for the Beetaloo GBA region, interpreted as part of GBA from remote sensing information. It includes locations and descriptions of dams, sinkholes, waterholes, circular clay filled depressions and ephemeral wetlands in the region. Waterholes and sinkholes are particularly prevalent in western Beetaloo GBA region. The sinkholes, waterholes and wetlands often appear to occur in clusters, and can be associated with depressions that can be over 1000m across. Some features may also occur adjacent to large palaeo-valleys, or in abandoned stream channels. Others seem to align with geological lineaments. Some sinkholes appear to be quite recent and contain little vegetation, whereas others are older and contain thick stands of trees.  It is likely than many of sinkholes and depressions are forms of pesudo-karst that have formed in deeply weathered regolith on the Carpentaria Basin. Where the Carpentaria Basin is thin there is potential for sinkholes and conduits to intersect with limestone karst (sinkholes and conduits) that occur in the Cambrian Limestone Aquifer.  \n\n\n## **Attribution** \nGeological and Bioregional Assessment Program\n\n\n## **History** \nPoints were manually interpreted from remote sensing data. Underlying datasets used to help with interpretation and targeting areas of interest include: Remote sensing images for Beetaloo GBA region - regolith ratios and barest earth (Available at: https://data.gov.au/data/dataset/0e84fa22-f397-489c-b99a-6492bf010613) and Digital Earth Australia Waterbodies (Available at: https://ecat.ga.gov.au/geonetwork/srv/eng/catalog.search#/metadata/132814).  The following columns are included in the dataset 1. Type - these are Dams, Waterholes (naturally occurring features), sinkholes, Ephemeral wetlands and depression. 2. Description - includes information on feature shape, vegetation etc., 3. Dimension, an estimate of longest dimension (in metres) 4. Name- whether the locality has a name. 5.

Over time, the ACLD will continue to grow as records from each new Census are linked which will further enhance its longitudinal view. The ACLD will also be augmented in the future to take account of migration and births that occur between Censuses.",

These sites have been identified as requiring to be upgraded from their current standard to cater for larger fire vehicles. These works have been identified in the RFMP 2019-28. \nThe symbology is determined by the 'Required_Works' field. The current values are 'Proposed Light Unit', 'Proposed Walking Track', 'Upgraded Rigid Float'.\nProposed Light Unit  - To allow the safe passage of light units (4x4 Landcruiser or similar carrying a water tank of 400 – 600 litres). Generally, these features will have a width of 3 metres of natural, grass, sealed or gravel surface, corners of sufficient radius to make 3-point turns by light units unnecessary.\nProposed Walking Track - Allow the safe passage of fire fighters on foot. Generally, these features will be less than 1m in width, of natural, grass, sealed or gravel surface and with vegetation maintained to allow single-file walking.\nUpgraded Rigid Float - To allow the safe passage of a rigid body truck carrying a D4 or equivalent sized bulldozer or machinery. Generally, these features will have the same characteristics as tanker roads but will have smaller rollovers and no switchback corners.",

    "description": "Water Data Online provides free access to nationally consistent, current and historical water data (and related information) that is collected by the Bureau of Meteorology under the Water Regulations (2008). It allows users to view and download standardised data and reports. \nWatercourse level and discharge (Water Regulations, Category 1) time series data collected from approximately 3500 measurement stations across Australia is currently available on Water Data Online. This data has generally been supplied by lead water agencies.\nThe Bureau will continue to work to expand the number of water information categories and water monitoring stations presented. For more information refer to the Water Data Online information sheet\nThe time period over which data is available varies according to how long the stations have been operating. The period of record for some locations starts in the late 19th century. Water Data Online does not display near real time, or flood data. Water Data Online also contains historical data from some stations that are no longer being operated. Such data can provide valuable insight into environmental changes and help build a more comprehensive national picture of our water resources.",

    "description": "Ambulance Victoria has two official response time targets: Respond to Code 1 incidents within 15 minutes for 85% of incidents state-wide, and\nRespond to Code 1 incidents within 15 minutes for 90% of incidents in centres with populations greater than 7,500. Response times are an important measure of the service we provide, but are only one of a number of measures used to gauge the effective\ndelivery of an ambulance service. \nOur response times are measured from the receipt of the triple zero (000) call until paramedics arrive on scene. Response times are\ninfluenced by many factors including traffic, distance required to travel, availability of ambulances and demand for our services. \nWe designate those patients that require urgent paramedic and hospital care as \"Code 1,\" and these patients receive a \"lights and sirens\"\nresponse. The tables provide information about our Code 1 response time performance by both Local Government Area (LGA) and Urban Centres and Localities (UCL). Code 2 incidents are acute, but not time critical and do not require a lights and sirens response. AV's average Code 2 response time\nperformance has also been provided. \nAs part of our process of continual improvement, the response time performance shown below has been calculated using data sourced from\nthe Computer Aided Dispatch (CAD) system used across Victoria.  UCLs : These are geographical areas based on the Australian Bureau of Statistics\nUrban Centres and Localities (UCLs) boundaries and residential population.\nAmbulance Victoria reports performance for larger UCLs where population\nexceeds 7,500 persons.",

    "description": "This dataset presents counts of payment recipients by payment type for the quarter ending March 2020. The data is based on the recipient's geocoded address aggregated by Statistical Area Level 2 (SA2) from the Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS) 2016.\nThe Department of Social Services (DSS) is the Australian Government's lead agency in the development and delivery of social policy, and is working to improve the lifetime wellbeing of people and families in Australia. DSS' policies and services respond to need across people's lives - looking after families, children and older people; providing a safety net for people who cannot fully support themselves; enhancing the wellbeing of people with high needs; assisting people who need help with care; and supporting a diverse and harmonious society. DSS supports people and families in Australia by encouraging independence and participation, and supporting a cohesive society.\nFor more information on this dataset please visit the Australian Government Open Data.\nFor further details on payments, see 'A guide to Australian Government payments'.\nPlease note:\n\n\nIn order to protect individuals' privacy, identified populations between 1 and 4 have been suppressed and replaced with '&lt;5' for confidentiality purposes. Additional data may be suppressed and replaced with 'n.p.' (not provided) to prevent the derivation of identified populations that have values of less than 5.\n\n\nCaveats specific to payments type can be found in the relevant payment description of the original data.\n\n\nAURIN has spatialised this dataset and have made the following replacements to enforce data type consistency: \n\n\n'&lt;5' has been assigned a value of '-1' within the data\n\n\nA boolean field has been created for each data field to flag left-censored data. 'True' is assigned to fields that have been censored.\n\n\n'n.p.' (not provided) has been set to Null within the data.\n\n",

    "description": "    \n\nMean annual (00) and monthly (01a|12) transpiration (mm) from the plant canopy\nfor the period 1980-1999.Interpretation:Canopy transpiration is far more\nspatially variable than potential evaporation, reflecting the effects of water\nlimitation in most areas of the continent. Both the annual mean and seasonal\npattern broadly resemble the corresponding patterns for rainfall. Canopy\ntranspiration maps have more acontrasta (relative variation) than the total\nevaporation or rainfall maps because transpiration is a small component of\ntotal evaporation in areas of low plant cover (the remainder being soil\nevaporation).The partitioning between soil evaporation and canopy\ntranspiration in the model is determined by leaf area index.Notes: These are\nmodel-based estimates from the BiosEquil model. Results are given for the\naBASEa (pre-1788) and aAGRICa (present day) conditions.

    "description": "A unique relationship exists between neighbouring males and females in the fiddler crab Uca capricornis. This experiment was designed to demonstrate how a male fiddler crab responds to different individuals tethered near to his burrow. The response of a male crab to the neighbour and a stranger (with similar physical characteristics) was observed. The trial ended when the focal male touched the tethered individual (approach), or after 5 minutes passed with no approach (ignore). The order of the two trials (neighbour or stranger) was random. 80 experiments were conducted in total, 20 of each of the following combinations: i) male -- neighbouring male, ii) male -- strange male, iii) male -- neighbouring female, iv) male -- strange female. \n\nThe results indicate that males treat female neighbours differently to male neighbours and intruders (of either sex). They were less likely to approach a female neighbour than an unknown female tethered in the same spot. They were equally likely to approach an unknown female, a neighbouring male and an unknown male.",

    "title": "Amphibians Remnant Patches",
    "description": "Urban Habitat Connectivity Project (UHCP)\n\nShort description: A package of data containing potential habitat and fragmentation for seven species groups in the urban ACT. Each species group has two layer files. Connected habitat layers show potential core and corridor habitat for the species group, and connectivity/fragmentation between these habitat patches. Remnant patches layers contain areas which are predicted to be fragmented and inaccessible for the species group, but may be important for restoration activities. These layers are outputs of ecological connectivity modelling and have been developed using spatial data representing habitat and connectivity requirements specific to the species group.\n\nThe following attributes are available in the data table for Connected Habitat layers:\n\n\n<ul><li>Species Group* - indicates the species group of interest</li><li>Patch ID – a unique identifier for each ‘patch’ of connected habitat, an ID that is given to group all habitat areas which are predicted to be connected to each other.</li><li>Habitat Type* – identifies if the polygon meets core or corridor habitat requirements, or if it is a remnant patch.</li><li>Habitat Number – a numeric value linked to Habitat Type to support statistics and symbology. Core habitat has a value of 0 and corridor habitat has a value of 1.</li><li>Patch Area (Ha)* – the area of the individual polygon in hectares.</li><li>Connected Habitat Area (Ha) – the total area of potential habitat in the connected patch, determined by summing the Patch Area for all polygons with the same Patch ID.</li><li>Shape area – the polygon’s area, calculated by default in meters squared.</li><li>Shape length – the length of the line enclosing the polygon, calculated by default in meters squared.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n* Is also available in the data table for Remnant Patches layers.\n\nSpatial resolution: 1:10,000\n\nCoordinate system: GDA2020 MGA zone 55\n\nMETHODS\n\nData collection / creation: <a>Spatial layers for habitat and barriers were created and input into a habitat connectivity/fragmentation model specifically designed for the species group. The model was developed using metrics derived from expert elicitation. These metrics quantified essential habitat and connectivity requirements for the species group, for example the preferred spacing of trees, the maximum crossable width of a road, the typical dispersal distance, etc. </a>The model identified habitat and barriers to connectivity, based on the metrics which could be mapped. Habitat was delineated by patch size to determine core and corridor habitat, and to remove areas which are too small to be functional. The habitat type is visible in the attribute table of the data.\n\nConnectivity between habitat patches is dependent on the species group’s dispersal capacity and the availability of core habitat, suitable corridors and a path without barriers. To assess this core habitat areas were buffered by the species group’s dispersal distance. This identified how far an individual will move to find a new core habitat patch. Movement to this distance is dependent on a suitable path. All habitat was buffered by the distance the species can move outside habitat (through non-habitat areas). This identified how far an individual will move outside any habitat (core or corridor) before they require another habitat patch (i.e. how far they can travel between stepping stones).Connectivity is further complicated by impassable barriers. Barriers were used to slice up the dispersal buffers and identify ‘dispersal patches’, areas which an individual can move within. Fragmentation is seen when a barrier is present, patches are too far from core habitat, or corridor habitat is too far apart.\n\nA unique ID was applied to each patch and represents connectivity/fragmentation. The patches were intersected with habitat to apply the new ID to the habitat areas. The final model outputs identify areas of potential core, corridor or remnant (inaccessible) habitat. Core and corridor habitat are viewable in the connected habitat dataset, whilst remnant patches are available separately. The data was simplified using the Douglas-Peuker algorithm, a tolerance of 0.5-2m, minimum size of 2-5m2 for retention, and holes filled in if less than 20m2. Small adjoining slithers &lt;20m2 were dissolved into neighbouring polygons to optimise drawing speeds. Please contact the project team for the model script or further details on the methodology.\n\nNOTES ON USE\n\nQuality: The habitat connectivity modelling used to produce the data was informed by work by the City of Melbourne <a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/331035992_Linking_Nature_in_the_City_A_framework_for_improving_ecological_connectivity_across_the_City_of_Melbourne\">(Kirk et al., 2018)</a>. The original methods were expanded on, with habitat and connectivity requirements (metrics) specific to the species group determined from expert elicitation and further analysis to consider patch size for core or corridor patches. The expert elicitation process provided the best and most relevant quantitative description of habitat and barriers available (for a species group rather than a specific species). The input datasets were then tailored to the metrics for this project. Existing datasets were refined to be relevant and reflect the metrics identified through expert elicitation. New datasets were created where data was missing. All data was derived from existing authoritative sources and/or remotely sensed data. This data curation process ensured the input datasets, and resulting output, were relevant and fit for purpose.\n\nLimitations: This data should be considered indicative only as there are limitations to the modelling process. It considers all habitat and barriers equally and as discrete objects (i.e. it applies a discrete boundary around a patch and does not account for gradients or flexible boundaries).The model predicts habitat and connectivity based on the data available. It does not assess whether a species is present or consider temporal variability. Some habitat requirements are not mapped (e.g. native vegetation, lack of predators) due to the lack of an accurate or complete dataset. Some of these requirements are critical to the success of the species group. These habitat requirements are available and have been derived from expert elicitation. They should be considered at an area of interest.\n\nThe model assumes the input data is up to date and accurate. Many of the habitat and barrier datasets used as inputs into the models are in some way informed by remote sensing data. Remote sensing data has limitations, such as potential for misclassification (e.g. bare ground and pavement could be confused). Additionally, remotely sensed data captures a point in time and will become outdated. Manual checks and improvements using supplementary data for specific sites have been completed to reduce as much error as possible.\n\nData refinement: Unmapped habitat and connectivity requirements should be considered when using the data. The full list of known habitat and connectivity requirements for each species group, including those considered by the model and those unaccounted for, is available by request. Other data may also be used to track changes post-LiDAR capture. For example, new development footprints may be used to remove non-habitat areas and can be done so at a faster rate than waiting for new LiDAR captures and re-running the model.\n\n\n\nSHARING\n\nLicenses/restrictions on use: Creative Commons By Attribution 4.0 (Australian Capital Territory)\n\nHow to cite this data: ACT Government, 2023.

    "description": "This dataset presents counts of payment recipients by payment type for the quarter ending June 2016. The data is based on the recipient's geocoded address aggregated by Local Government Area (LGA) from the Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS) 2014.\nThe Department of Social Services (DSS) is the Australian Government's lead agency in the development and delivery of social policy, and is working to improve the lifetime wellbeing of people and families in Australia. DSS' policies and services respond to need across people's lives - looking after families, children and older people; providing a safety net for people who cannot fully support themselves; enhancing the wellbeing of people with high needs; assisting people who need help with care; and supporting a diverse and harmonious society. DSS supports people and families in Australia by encouraging independence and participation, and supporting a cohesive society.\nFor more information on this dataset please visit the Australian Government Open Data.\nFor further details on payments, see 'A guide to Australian Government payments'.\nPlease note:\n\n\nIn order to protect individuals' privacy, identified populations between 1 and 4 have been suppressed and replaced with '&lt;5' for confidentiality purposes. Additional data may be suppressed and replaced with 'n.p.' (not provided) to prevent the derivation of identified populations that have values of less than 5.\n\n\nIndividuals who live overseas, individuals who are without a valid home address and individuals who only have a postal address cannot be assigned to a locational boundary. State/territory totals derived from Local Government Area data will not match actual state and territory totals, due to different statistical geography methodologies.\n\n\nCaveats specific to payments type can be found in the relevant payment description of the original data.\n\n\nAURIN has spatialised this dataset and have made the following replacements to enforce data type consistency: \n\n\n'&lt;5' has been assigned a value of '-1' within the data\n\n\nA boolean field has been created for each data field to flag left-censored data. 'True' is assigned to fields that have been censored.\n\n\n'n.p.' (not provided) has been set to Null within the data.\n\n",

    "description": "The _Survey of Trust in Australian public services_ is a regular, national survey measuring public satisfaction, trust and experiences with Australian public services. This dataset provides trust, satisfaction and experience Survey results across a variety of indicators. The Survey was previously called the Citizen Experience Survey. \r\n\r\nAs of June 2022, more than 43,000 people, aged 18 years and over, have participated in the Survey. Between March 2019 and June 2021, eight survey waves, each surveying approximately 2,500-5,000 people, were conducted. Since July 2021, twelve additional waves of approximately 1,000 people each month have been conducted and analysed. Continued regular data collection has enabled creation of a reliable time series of data.\r\n\r\nThe design of the Survey ensures people reflect on their experiences with Australian public services (also known as Commonwealth, Federal or National public services) and not state, territory or local public services, or Government or policy.\r\n \r\nParticipation in the Survey is voluntary and information collected is anonymous and de-identified. The Survey is nationally representative of age, state/territory and gender. Survey participants consent to the publication of results in aggregate. \r\n\r\nWhen reporting Trust in Australian public services data, the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet must be attributed as the source. \r\n \r\nAdditional detail on the Survey is available on the APS Reform website at https://www.apsreform.gov.au/trustsurvey and at the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet website at https://www.pmc.gov.au ",

    "description": "From the abstract of the ANARE Research Note:\r\n\r\nThe Larsemann Hills are a series of granite and gneiss peninsulas extending into Prydz Bay, between the Amery Ice Shelf and the Sorsdal Glacier.  They are dissected by steep-sided valleys produced by at least two glacial stages in the Holocene.  There are over 150 freshwater lakes in the hills, ranging from small ponds less than 1 m deep, to glacial lakes up to 10 ha and 38 m deep.  The lakes are young, with the oldest basins being about 9000 years old. Variations in the characteristics of the lakes reflect deglaciation history, proximity to the continental ice margin and exposure to the ocean.  The main source of the water is snow melt, augmented by sea spray into the more exposed lakes.  The waters are well mixed by katabatic winds.  Most lakes thaw for up to 2 months in summer, but some are permanently frozen.\r\n\r\nThe waters have mainly low conductivity and exceptionally low turbidity, and have near-neutral pH values.  The ionic order is Na+ greater than Mg2+ greater than Ca2+ greater than K+.  This reflects a strong marine influence, with calcium dominating in a very few catchments.\r\n\r\nThe Larsemann Hills were discovered in 1935 by Captain Klarius Mikkelsen in the Thorshavn.  Australian, Chinese and Russian stations were established in the area in the mid-late 1980's.  Law (Australia) was commenced in 1986 when an Apple Hut was unloaded from MV Nella Dan.  A subsequent visit was made during the 1986 winter.  The first Australian scientific expedition visited the area during the 1986-87 austral summer.  Progress Station (Russia) was occupied at the time.  Building of Zhong Shan commenced in January 1989.\r\n\r\n*******************\r\n\r\nSeveral files are associated with this metadata record:\r\n\r\n1) A PDF copy of the original ANARE Research Note\r\n\r\n2) A CSV file containing the data presented in the ANARE Research Note\r\n\r\n3) A shapefile of the lakes presented in the ANARE Research Note\r\n\r\nThe fields in this dataset are:\r\n\r\nlake_id\r\n\r\nlake_name (text)\r\n\r\nlocation (text description)\r\n\r\nlongitude (decimal degrees)\r\n\r\nlatitude (decimal degrees)\r\n\r\naltitude (m)\r\n\r\nlake_area (ha)\r\n\r\ncatchment_area (ha)\r\n\r\nmaximum_depth (m)\r\n\r\ndimensions (m)\r\n\r\ndistance_from_polar_plateau (m)\r\n\r\ndescription (text)\r\n\r\ngeology (text)\r\n\r\nwater_temperature (C)\r\n\r\npH\r\n\r\nwater_conductivity (micro mho/cm)\r\n\r\nEh (reduction potential, mV)\r\n\r\nca_concentration (Ca++, ppm)\r\n\r\nmg_concentration (Mg++, ppm)\r\n\r\nna_concentration (NA+, ppm)\r\n\r\nk_concentration (K+, ppm)\r\n\r\nionic_ratios_na_ca_mg_k (ionic ratio of na:(ca+mg+mk))\r\n\r\nionic_ratios_ca_na_k_mg (ionic ratio of ca:(na+k+mg))\r\n\r\nbottom_sediment_grab_sample (text description of results)\r\n\r\n",

    "description": "This dataset is one of seven point-level samples (covering NSW, ACT, VIC, TAS, WA, NT, and SA) from the Ambient National Transport Noise data for 2018/2019. Instructions for applying for a quote to obtain the full dataset are provided below.\nAmbient has developed a comprehensive national transport noise map, offering valuable insights for home buyers, investors, researchers, urban planners, policymakers, and professionals working in community well-being and transportation. This dataset provides a powerful tool for understanding and analyzing the impacts of noise on urban environments, supporting informed decision-making in various fields.\nThe full dataset offers two main components, providing comprehensive noise levels with breakdowns by time of day (day, evening, night) and exposure levels (maximum and minimum):\nVector Data (Transport Noise Dataset Buildings):\nBuilding-level day and night noise data based on Geoscape Building Footprint (as points) data for individual noise sources: road, rail, and aircraft. The attribute data for each building captured the highest (most exposed) and lowest (least exposed) noise level across all facades of all storeys. The dataset attempted to model all roads and rail lines, based on the data available. For airlines, modelling was based on actual aircraft movements captured over two periods of around two weeks. If aircraft did not flight a specific route at that time, that route will not appear in the noise levels.\nRaster Data (Transport Noise Overlay):\nRaster representations of noise data provide a broad overview of noise distribution across areas. These include separate representations for road, rail, and aircraft noise, during both day and night, with raster resolutions ranging from 10x10m to 50x50m.\nA detailed explanation of the attributes and their values can be found below. More information about the data product can be found at https://www.ambientmaps.com.au/.\nThis sample dataset covers a single Level 2 Statistical Area (SA2) area for the vector data, Melbourne CBD - East in VIC with SA2 code 206041503, as defined by the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS). It serves as a representative example of the full dataset's capabilities. The complete coverage for the full dataset encompasses all of the five states.\nResearchers and professionals interested in accessing the full data beyond this sample SA2 are encouraged to request a quote from AURIN: https://aurin.org.au/resources/data/ambient-maps-data/ for the full dataset. The complete offering provides a more extensive and detailed analysis, enabling in-depth studies and comprehensive urban planning initiatives.\nBy exploring this sample dataset, users can gain insights into the potential applications and value of the full Ambient Maps Noise Mapping Dataset, supporting their decision-making process for acquiring the complete data offering.\nSample data attribute explanation:\nSP = SoundPLAN – denoting these decibel (dB) values are straight out of SoundPLAN, uncorrected in any way.\nRD = Road noise\nRL = Rail noise from all rail sources. There is also HR and TR which separates Heavy Rail and Trams.\nD, E, N is day (7am to 7pm), evening (7pm to 11pm), and night (11pm to 7am) time periods.\nAircraft_DE and Aircraft_N should have an SP at the start, and present all aircraft movement noise levels for the day+evening (DE) and night (N) time periods.\nMax is the noise level at the most exposed façade\nMin is the noise level at the least exposed façade.\nBUILDING_PID refers to the GeoScape Building ID (2018/2019), which was utilized to create the initial building footprint noise data.\nFor example, SP_Rd_MAX_E = nosie levels straight out of SoundPLAN for roads, at the most exposed façade, for the evening time period.",

    "description": "This technical report uses farm survey data to measure the contribution of cross-farm resource reallocation to industry-level productivity growth within Australian broadacre agriculture. The results show that resource reallocation between farms accounted for around half the industry-level productivity growth that occurred between 1978 and 2010, and its contribution appears to have increased over time. This effect is mainly caused by the asymetric impact of technological progress on incumbent farms, as reflected in difference in productivity growth and the relative mobility of different production factors. These findings provide useful insights for policy-makers considering industry-level reforms as a means of imrpving aggregate agricultural productivity. ",

    "description": "This dataset is a component of the 'Jervis Bay Baseline Studies' project conducted by the Department of Defence, CSIRO and the Australian Defence Force Academy.\n\nThe meteorological station (35.133S, 150.762E) recorded winds and atmospheric pressure at Governor Head (Jervis Bay). The site is several hundred metres inland of 50m high cliffs and is 63m above sea-level.\n\nThis record provides wind statistics for February 1989. Five datasets are included here representing different times of the day: 0000-0550, 0600-1150, 1200-1750 and 1800-2350. Individual measurements have been converted so that trends of wind speed and direction can be seen for the time period in question. The fifth dataset incorporates all the wind data collected irrespective of time providing a monthly summary. The station initially recorded wind data at 10 minute intervals.\n\nThis is one of thirty-six child records that relate to the parent, 629051e0-2b7b-11dd-a343-00188b4c0af8. A pdf outlining the structure and hierarchy of metadata records relating to the 'Jervis Bay Baseline Studies' project is available to download through this record. Meteorological data was collected to investigate wind forced circulation in Jervis Bay, NSW.",

    "description": "## **Abstract** \n\nThis dataset was supplied to the Bioregional Assessment Programme by a third party and is presented here as originally supplied. Metadata was not provided and has been compiled by the Bioregional Assessment Programme based on the known details at the time of acquisition.\n\n\n\nThis dataset includes the spatial location of all works associated with surface water licences from NSW in the BA regions. The short guide to NSW Office of Water's licensing data has been provided to accompany the dataset (both the spatial locations and the associated licence details). \n\n\n\nA SHORT GUIDE TO NSW OFFICE OF WATER'S LICENSING DATA\n\n\n\nMethodology\n\n1.\tUsing the supplied polygons a spatial select was taken for each polygon area for the Surface and Groundwater Approved Work locations. These Work Location points were exported to an ArcGIS 10.0 File Geodatabase for each polygon area. These work locations have a \"Status\" of either \"Active\" (under the Water Act) or \"Current\" (under the Water Management Act).\n\n2.\tThe Approved License number attached to each Work was then used to query the Office of Water's Water Licensing System (WLS) to extract details on each Approved license including any linked Water Access Licenses (WAL) if the Work was now under the Water Management Act (WMA). These files end in \\*_WLS-EXTRACT_n.xls.\n\n3.\tIf found the linked WAL number is used to re-query using WLS to extract details on each linked WAL. These files end in \\*_WLS-EXTRACT_n_WALs_volume.xls.\n\n4.\tIt should be noted that due to query size constraints in WLS the output files for each polygon area may be split into a number of subset files (\"n\" being the number of the subset).\n\n5.\tThe field headings are as per the WLS Extract report. They include some characters (e.g. \"\\\") that may cause problems if loaded into ArcGIS. Not knowing how the data is to be used I have not amended them.\n\n\n\nUnderstanding Licensing data\n\n1.\tA Licensed Work Approval may have more than work (and therefore work location, i.e. point) associated with it. If the Licensed Work Approval is under the old Water Act it may have associated with it an \"Entitlement\" volume (if on a Regulated River) or an \"Allocation\" volume in an unregulated area. Please note that these volumes are for the whole licensed approval distributed amongst the related works but not against any particular one.\n\n2.\tA Licensed Work Approval, if under the newer Water Management Act may have more than one linked WAL. Each WAL may have a \"Share Component\" volume associated with it. This will nee to be summed against each linked Licensed Work Approval to get the total WAL volume. Please note again that these volumes are for the whole licensed approval distributed amongst the related works but not against any particular one.\n\n3.\tIt is important to note that under the WMA it is possible for WALs not to have a linked Licensed Work Approval (to support Water Trading). This means a spatial select with not find these WALs and the volumes associated with them. The WAL is still related to a particular Water Source and can be re-associated with a different Licensed Work Approval at a later date.\n\n\n\nThis dataset has been provided to the BA Programme for use within the programme only.

DSS' policies and services respond to need across people's lives - looking after families, children and older people; providing a safety net for people who cannot fully support themselves; enhancing the wellbeing of people with high needs; assisting people who need help with care; and supporting a diverse and harmonious society. DSS supports people and families in Australia by encouraging independence and participation, and supporting a cohesive society.\nFor more information on this dataset please visit the Australian Government Open Data.\nFor further details on payments, see 'A guide to Australian Government payments'.\nPlease note:\n\n\nIn order to protect individuals' privacy, identified populations between 1 and 19 have been suppressed and replaced with '&lt;20' for confidentiality purposes.

    "description": "This dataset is a component of the 'Jervis Bay Baseline Studies' project conducted by the Department of Defence, CSIRO and the Australian Defence Force Academy.\n\nThe meteorological station (35.133S, 150.762E) recorded winds and atmospheric pressure at Governor Head (Jervis Bay). The site is several hundred metres inland of 50m high cliffs and is 63m above sea-level.\n\nThis record provides wind statistics for September 1989. Five datasets are included here representing different times of the day: 0000-0550, 0600-1150, 1200-1750 and 1800-2350. Individual measurements have been converted so that trends of wind speed and direction can be seen for the time period in question. The fifth dataset incorporates all the wind data collected irrespective of time providing a monthly summary. The station initially recorded wind data at 10 minute intervals.\n\nThis is one of thirty-six child records that relate to the parent, 629051e0-2b7b-11dd-a343-00188b4c0af8. A pdf outlining the structure and hierarchy of all metadata records relating to the 'Jervis Bay Baseline Studies' project is available to download through this record.

    "description": "This dataset presents counts of payment recipients by payment type for the quarter ending June 2015. The data is based on the recipient's geocoded address aggregated by Local Government Area (LGA) from the Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS) 2014.\nThe Department of Social Services (DSS) is the Australian Government's lead agency in the development and delivery of social policy, and is working to improve the lifetime wellbeing of people and families in Australia. DSS' policies and services respond to need across people's lives - looking after families, children and older people; providing a safety net for people who cannot fully support themselves; enhancing the wellbeing of people with high needs; assisting people who need help with care; and supporting a diverse and harmonious society. DSS supports people and families in Australia by encouraging independence and participation, and supporting a cohesive society.\nFor more information on this dataset please visit the Australian Government Open Data.\nFor further details on payments, see 'A guide to Australian Government payments'.\nPlease note:\n\n\nIn order to protect individuals' privacy, identified populations between 1 and 19 have been suppressed and replaced with '&lt;20' for confidentiality purposes. Additional data may be suppressed and replaced with 'n.p.' (not provided) to prevent the derivation of identified populations that have values of less than 20.\n\n\nIndividuals who live overseas, individuals who are without a valid home address and individuals who only have a postal address cannot be assigned to a locational boundary. State/territory totals derived from Local Government Area data will not match actual state and territory totals, due to different statistical geography methodologies.\n\n\nCaveats specific to payments type can be found in the relevant payment description of the original data.\n\n\nAURIN has spatialised this dataset and have made the following replacements to enforce data type consistency: \n\n\n'&lt;20' has been assigned a value of '-1' within the data\n\n\nA boolean field has been created for each data field to flag left-censored data. 'True' is assigned to fields that have been censored.\n\n\n'n.p.' (not provided) has been set to Null within the data.\n\n",

The site provides additional features for viewing and interacting with the data and for downloading the data in various formats.</em></strong>  \n\nThis dataset, created in June 2013, provides an indication of the likelihood of a flood occurring from creeks inside the Brisbane City Council local government area. This layer contributes to the overall Flood Awareness Map.\n\nCreek flooding occurs when intense rain falls over a creek catchment. Runoff from houses, streets, parks etc contributes to creek flooding. Once the capacity of the creek is reached, overtopping of the banks will occur which can cause flooding. Creek floodwaters can be very fast moving and rise and recede quickly without much warning.\n\nThere are four different creek flooding likelihood areas in Flood Awareness Map, namely High, Medium, Low and very low.\n\nThe creek High likelihood layer consists of a combination of the 5% Annual Exceedance Probability (AEP) (20 year Average Recurrence Interval (ARI)) from BCC’s flood inundation extents usually utilising the surfaces produced as part of a Flood Study where available and the remaining areas from the 5% AEP (20 year ARI) delivered as part of the Citywide Flood Awareness Mapping study (Worley Parsons, 2012).\n\nThe creek Medium likelihood layer consists of a combination of the 1% AEP (100 year ARI) from BCC’s flood inundation extents (outside high likelihood area) usually utilising the surfaces produced as part of a Flood Study where available and the remaining areas from the 1% AEP (100 year ARI) delivered as part of the Citywide Flood Awareness Mapping study (Worley Parsons, 2012).\n\nThe creek Low likelihood layer consists of a combination of the 0.2% AEP (500 year ARI) from BCC’s flood inundation extents (outside high likelihood area) usually utilising the surfaces produced as part of a Flood Study where available and the remaining areas from the 0.2% AEP (500 year ARI) delivered as part of the Citywide Flood Awareness Mapping study (Worley Parsons, 2012).\n\nThe creek Very Low likelihood layer consists of a combination of the 0.05% AEP (2000 year ARI) from BCC’s flood inundation extents (outside high likelihood area) usually utilising the surfaces produced as part of a Flood Study where available and the remaining areas from the 0.05% AEP (2000 year ARI) delivered as part of the Citywide Flood Awareness Mapping study (Worley Parsons, 2012).",

Both the annual mean and seasonal\npattern broadly resemble the corresponding patterns for rainfall. Canopy\ntranspiration maps have more acontrasta (relative variation) than the total\nevaporation or rainfall maps because transpiration is a small component of\ntotal evaporation in areas of low plant cover (the remainder being soil\nevaporation).The partitioning between soil evaporation and canopy\ntranspiration in the model is determined by leaf area index.Notes: These are\nmodel-based estimates from the BiosEquil model.

Applications of these data include solar energy, agriculture, building thermal design and water balance modelling. Climatologies are given for two radiation parameters: the global horizontal exposure, which is the total amount of solar energy falling on a horizontal surface over a time interval; and the direct normal exposure which is the total of the component of radiation from the sun’s disk on a plane perpendicular to the beam. Climatologies of daily exposure are given as an annual average and as a set of twelve monthly averages. Climatologies of the diurnal cycle are given as monthly averages of hourly exposures through the day. These data sets are derived from 23 years (1990 - 2012) of data from satellites operated by Japan Meteorological Agency and the US National Oceanographic &amp; Atmospheric Administration. NEII",

    "description": "\nThis map contains district-based ACT canopy cover polygons at 1m resolution (vegetation cover above 3m) as at April/May 2020, detected with Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR). The full ACT vector dataset has been split into districts and 1km tiles to allow for easier viewing.\n<strong>WARNING: Due to</strong><strong> complexity and high resolution this dataset </strong><strong>may draw slowly or appear to miss some trees. For best results, zoom in, view single districts separately, or download a local copy.</strong>\nLIDAR data was acquired in April/May 2020 for the ACT under contract by Aerometrex, at an average resolution of 12ppm. LiDAR is classified to Level 3 (for ground) and delivered as LAS v1.4 in in GDA2020 MGA zone 55. Visit <a href=\"https://www.planning.act.gov.au/professionals/survey-spatial/spatial-information/lidar-data\">https://www.planning.act.gov.au/professionals/survey-spatial/spatial-information/lidar-data</a> for more info. Processing was completed on the LAS GDA2020 MGA Zone 55 LAS tile set using AHD vertical datum at 1m resolution. Dataset represents high vegetation above 3m (tree canopy or tree-approximate objects - see caveats).\nMethodology:<ul><li>High noise errors were reclassified.</li><li>Digital Surface Model (DSM) and Digital Elevation Model (DEM) surfaces were created using ArcPro 2.8 LAS Dataset Geoprocessing Tools at 1 m resolution.</li><li>Canopy Height Model CHM was determined = Digital Surface Model (DSM) - Digital Elevation Model (DEM).</li><li>Pits (empty cells inside tree canopies) of 2 pixel (2x1m) were removed using Nibble.</li><li>An ACT Urban building footprint layer generated from the 2020 LIDAR dataset by Aerometrex was used to remove spurious canopy portions from building roof areas in the urban area.</li><li>An NDVI layer from pan-sharpened Pleiades multispectral satellite imagery, acquired in April 2019 (the Uriarra area) and November 2019 (rest of Urban Area) was used to delete erroneous non-vegetative surfaces in urban areas.</li><li>Canopy holes &lt;=1m2 were filled by Eliminate tool.</li><li>GDA2020 MGA Zone 55.</li><li>Tree canopy lower than 3m were removed. Converted to a binary raster, then converted to vector.</li></ul>\n\nOther available datasets: ACT 2020 Canopy Height Model (raster), ACT Trees (Individual Delineated Trees with Height) (vector), DEM, DSM, Contours, Building Footprints (© Australian Capital Territory &amp; Aerometrex Limited), ACT Permeability, shrub cover - contact spatialdata@act.gov.au. Full LAS Tile sets can also be obtained in the following vertical datums: GDA2020 ellipsoidal, AHD, AVWS - see <a href=\"https://elevation.fsdf.org.au/\">https://elevation.fsdf.org.au/</a>. Other derivative products (including other canopy products) are available on request or through the ACT <a href=\"https://actmapi-actgov.opendata.arcgis.com\">Geospatial Data Catalogue</a>.\nRoad, Block and Division Canopy 2020 Statistics also available here: <a href=\"https://actmapi-actgov.opendata.arcgis.com/maps/act-canopy-cover-2020-statistics/about\">https://actmapi-actgov.opendata.arcgis.com/maps/act-canopy-cover-2020-statistics/about</a>\nCaveats:1. Please note that most (if not all) CHM-based tree delineation results should be thought of as &quot;tree-approximate objects&quot;, and not actual trees. 2. Although every effort was made to remove any erroneous polygons (such as street lights, back yard fences and powerlines), there are likely to be some errors remaining.\nCreative Commons by Attribution (CCBY) 4.0 (Australian Capital Territory).

Having defined preferred and non-preferred terms within sport is intended to promote consistency in terminology across the entire sporting community.

    "description": "The Australian Census Longitudinal Dataset (ACLD) brings together a 5% sample from the 2006 Census with records from the 2011 Census to create a research tool for exploring how Australian society is changing over time. In taking a longitudinal view of Australians, the ACLD may uncover new insights into the dynamics and transitions that drive social and economic change over time, conveying how these vary for diverse population groups and geographies. It is envisaged that the 2016 and successive Censuses will be added in the future, as well as administrative data sets. The ACLD is released in ABS TableBuilder and as a microdata product in the ABS Data Laboratory. \r\n\r\n The Census of Population and Housing is conducted every five years and aims to measure accurately the number of people and dwellings in Australia on Census Night. \r\n\r\n Microdata products are the most detailed information available from a Census or survey and are generally the responses to individual questions on the questionnaire. They also include derived data from answers to two or more questions and are released with the approval of the Australian Statistician.\r\nThe following microdata products are available for this longitudinal dataset: \r\n•ACLD in TableBuilder - an online tool for creating tables and graphs. \r\n•ACLD in ABS Data Laboratory (ABSDL) - for in-depth analysis using a range of statistical software packages.\r\n\r\n",

    "description": "Overview \r\n The report provides updated commodity forecasts as well as articles on the EU sugar industry, EU almond industry and investment on Australia's farms. \r\n\r\nKey Issues \r\n Commodity forecasts  \r\n• The gross value of farm production is forecast to increase by 3.3 per cent to around $58.4 billion in 2016-17, following an estimated 3.8 per cent increase to $56.5 billion in 2015-16. If realised, the gross value of farm production in 2016-17 would be around 13 per cent higher than the five-year average of $51.8 billion between 2011-12 and 2015-16 in nominal terms. \r\n• The gross value of livestock production is forecast to remain largely unchanged at $29.2 billion in 2016-17, following an estimated 7.7 per cent increase in 2015-16. \r\n• The gross value of crop production is forecast to increase by 6.6 per cent to $29.2 billion in 2016-17. This mainly reflects forecast increases in the gross values of horticulture, cotton and oilseed production offsetting forecast decreases in the gross values of wheat and barley production. \r\n• Export earnings from farm commodities are forecast to fall slightly to $44 billion in 2016-17, following an estimated 1.3 per cent increase in 2015-16 to $44.5 billion. \r\n• The agricultural commodities for which export earnings are forecast to fall in 2016-17 are beef and veal (-12 per cent), dairy products (-1 per cent), live feeder/slaughter cattle (-4 per cent), chickpeas (-32 per cent) and mutton (-17 per cent). Export earnings for wheat are expected to remain largely unchanged. \r\n• The forecast decreases in 2016-17 are expected to be partly offset by forecast rises in export earnings for wool (6 per cent), sugar (21 per cent), wine (1 per cent), cotton (40 per cent), lamb (3 per cent) and canola (43 per cent). \r\n• Export earnings for fisheries products are forecast to increase by 8 per cent to $1.7 billion in 2016-17, after increasing by an estimated 7 per cent in 2015-16. \r\n\r\n Economic assumptions underlying this set of commodity forecasts  \r\n\r\n In preparing this set of agricultural commodity forecasts: • World economic growth is assumed to be 2.8 per cent in 2016 and 3.3 per cent in 2017. \r\n• Economic growth in Australia averaged 2.9 per cent in 2015-16 and is assumed to average 2.7 per cent in 2016-17. \r\n• The Australian dollar is assumed to average US73 cents in 2016-17, largely unchanged from the estimated average for 2015-16. \r\n\r\n Articles on agricultural issues  \r\n\r\n The EU sugar industry  \r\n• The EU sugar market is highly regulated, with domestic price support, export subsidies and import restrictions. This stocktake of EU domestic and trade policies that support the EU sugar market will inform government and industry in the lead up to the commencement of Australia-EU FTA negotiations. \r\n• Australia's access to the EU sugar market is constrained by a country-specific tariff rate quota. Any improved access through either lower tariffs or increased quota would improve Australia's competitiveness in that market. \r\n\r\n The EU almond industry  \r\n• The European Union is the world's largest consumer and importer of almonds and has been a growing export market for Australian almonds since 2005-06. \r\n• However, significant benefits from an Australian-EU FTA are unlikely for Australian almonds because import tariffs are already low and equal to those faced by the United States, the main supplier to this market. \r\n\r\n Investment in Australian farms  \r\n• Investment in Australian farms is substantial, with net additions of non-land capital items on broadacre and dairy farms currently worth around $2 billion a year. \r\n• Farm operators and their spouses provide most of the capital used to fund the ownership and operation of Australian farms; corporate investors account for less than one-fifth of total capital. The strength of the family farm business structure suggests that corporate investors are unlikely to significantly displace family farmers in the near future. \r\n",
