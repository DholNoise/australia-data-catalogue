    "description": "An emerging CALD community refers to a place with a significant increase in the number of Culturally and Linguistically Diverse (CALD) populations according to ABS census counts. These communities may experience social barriers that adversely affect the quality of life. Emerging CALD Communities are an ongoing feature of the Australian cultural landscape. Further research has been required into the status of Emerging CALD Communities. This project concerns how social and environmental inequalities have been distributed in Australia's CALD populations over the last two decades. It aims to measure changes in the CALD populations and exposure to urban heat and greening due to social inequities and climate change. \nTwo layers of CALD total populations at the SA1 level were generated for five consecutive Australian Census years (2001, 2006, 2011, 2016, 2021) using historic ABS Census datasets. The first layer represents individuals who speak a non-English language at home, while the second layer includes those born in a country where the main language is non-English. Both layers were transformed and aggregated to ensure consistency across Census years, providing a detailed analysis of CALD population trends over two decades.\nThis project expands AURINʼs infrastructure of data and tools, in particular the integrated Heat Vulnerability Index toolkit developed by CI Sun that has provided cloud computing tools for deriving environmental indicators. The outcome of this project is a new nationwide longitudinal database with the quantification of CALD populations and social-environmental inequalities, which will fill a critical gap for AURINʼs data catalogue. The database supports and facilitates multidisciplinary research to perform spatial and statistical analyses to reveal the disproportionate exposure to urban heat and greening across CALD communities in Australia. Spatially explicit information can be generated from the database for planners to make intervention strategies for vulnerable CALD populations, to diminish the inequality for CALD. This significantly advances AURINʼs capability to support CALD research across social science, public health, and the environment, and achieve SDG goals.",

    "description": "The Coastal Lake Assessment and Management (CLAM) tool allows stakeholders to assess the social, economic and environmental trade-offs associated with development, remediation and use options for coastal lakes and estuaries. Researchers at the Australian National University (ANU) developed CLAM in 2004 when contracted by the NSW State Government to provide sustainability assessments of 8 coastal lakes. Several projects have since been established directly with local government and NRM groups.\n\nTo date, 27 CLAMs have been developed in New South Wales, where they generally fit within estuary management or catchment management plans. To develop these CLAMs and build local capacity to maintain them, ANU-Enterprise Pty Ltd - the commercial company of ANU developed an Accreditation Scheme whereby local consultants are trained in the CLAM approach.",

    "description": "The purpose of this data set was to compile distributional, general life-history characteristics and phylogenies for Australian tropical rain forest vertebrates to inform a wide range of comparative studies on the determinants of biodiversity patterns and to assess the impacts of global climate change. We provide three distinct data sets: (1) a table of species-specific distributional and life-history traits for 242 vertebrate species found in the rain forests of the Australian Wet Tropics; (2) species distribution maps (GIS raster files) for 202 of the species displaying both the realized and potential distributions; and (3) phylogenies for these species. These species represent 93 birds, 31 amphibians, 31 mammals (including one monotreme), and 47 reptiles. Where information exists, the distributional and life-history data compiled here present information on: indices of environmental specialization (ENFA), habitat specialization, average body mass and size, sexual dimorphism, reproductive characteristics such as age at first reproduction, clutch/litter size, number of reproductive bouts per year and breeding seasonality, longevity, time of day when most active, and dispersal ability; distributional characteristics such as range size (potential and realized for both total and core ranges) and observed ranges in temperature, precipitation, and elevation; and niche attributes such as environmental marginality and specialization. The distribution maps provided represent a combination of presence-only ecological niche modeling (using MaxEnt) to estimate the potential distribution of a species followed by biogeographic clipping by expert opinion based on extensive field data and a subregional classification relevant to the topography and biogeographic history of the region to produce best-possible estimates of the realized distribution. Our assemblage contains many species with a shared evolutionary history, and thus many analyses of these data will need to account for phylogeny. Although a comprehensive phylogeny with branch length information does not exist for this diverse group of species, we present a best-estimate composite phylogeny constructed primarily from recently published molecular phylogenies of included groups. \n\nThis metadata record is an extract from the authorive metadata records maintained by the tropical data hub (http://tropicaldatahub.org/data/6e58cda4-a2c9-4193-bb22-708e25054e3c).",

    "description": "In September and October of 2011 Geoscience Australia surveyed part of the offshore northern Perth Basin in order to map potential sites of natural hydrocarbon seepage. The primary objectives of the survey were to map the spatial distribution of seepage sites and characterise the nature of the seepage at these sites (gas vs oil, macroseepage vs microseepage; palaeo vs modern day seepage) on the basis of: acoustic signatures in the water column, shallow subsurface and on the seabed; geochemical signatures in rock and sediment samples and the water column; and biological signatures on the seabed. Areas of potential natural hydrocarbon seepage that were surveyed included proven (drilled) oil and gas accumulations, a breached structure, undrilled hydrocarbon prospects, and areas with potential signatures of fluid seepage identified in seismic, satellite remote sensing and multibeam bathymetry data. Within each of these areas the survey acquired: water column measurements with the CTD; acoustic data with single- and multi-beam echosounders, sidescan sonar and sub-bottom profiler (sidescan not acquired in Area F as it was too deep in places); and sediment and biological samples with the Smith-McIntyre Grab. In addition, data were collected with a remotely operated vehicle (ROV), integrated hydrocarbon sensor array, and CO2 sensor in selected areas. Sampling with the gravity corer had limited success in many of the more shallow areas (A-E) due to the coarse sandy nature of the seabed sediments. This data set comprises carbonate and specific surface area measurements in the upper 2cm of seabed sediments.\n\nYou can also purchase hard copies of Geoscience Australia data and other products at http://www.ga.gov.au/products-services/how-to-order-products/sales-centre.html",

    "description": "The Climate Vulnerability Assessment was designed to provide an overview of the impact of future climate change on all stages of production for the commodities and biosecurity risks assessed. The project used multicriteria analysis (MCA) models to produce assessments for the commodities and biosecurity risks in a consistent and comparable way, and a framework was developed to provide a rigorous, flexible and transparent process for assessing vulnerabilities and opportunities to climate change. Details of the approach and the climate data used in the assessments can be found in the Methodology Report which also details model exclusions and assumptions.\nAssessments were undertaken on commodities grouped into 6 nodes: Horticulture and Viticulture, Broadacre Cropping, Forestry, Extensive Livestock, Marine Fisheries, as well as for a set of biosecurity risks related to these primary industry sectors. The Summary Report gives details of the chosen commodities and biosecurity risks and summarises the high-level results.\nResults Reports for each commodity and biosecurity risk are being released. Visit the project's web pages to access these reports and for further information.\nThis dataset contains maps of modelled climate suitability for the parthenium weed model in the Biosecurity Risks node of the DPIRD Climate Vulnerability Assessment. Maps are provided (in GeoTIFF format) for each element of the model: the climate suitability for each month, climate suitability maps for each phenophase and also for each phenophase/climate variable combination in the model. Data is provided for each of the eight global climate models (GCMs) used in the project, as well as the climate suitability derived from historical observations, along with the ensemble median for each map.",

    "description": "\nThe focus of this dataset is the Australian Capital Territory (ACT). It contains digital spatial data developed to assist in land management decision making in the ACT. The dataset contains hazard ratings for land salinity, stream salt load and stream EC as well as overall salinity hazard for each HGL unit. Information about landscape functions and appropriate salinity management strategies are also listed. Hyperlinks to full management descriptions for each HGL unit are provided. The Hydrogeological Landscape (HGL) concept provides a structure for understanding how differences in salinity are expressed across the landscape. A HGL spatially differentiates areas with similar salt stores and pathways for salt mobilisation. The process of delineating a HGL relies on the integration of a number of causative factors: geology, soils, slope, regolith thickness, and climate; an understanding of the different modes of salinity development; and the impacts of salinity within landscapes (land salinity, salt load and salt concentration in streams due to salt contributions from base flow and runoff ). Information sources such as soil landscape maps, site characterisation, salinity occurrence maps, hydrogeological data, surface water and groundwater data are incorporated into standardised unit descriptions.\nFit for purpose: This dataset was captured at 1:25,000 scale. This dataset is fit for use as a tool for assessing land management issues at the paddock-scale in the ACT, but this does not negate the need for site assessment at a scale suitable to any potential land use or development under consideration.  The mapping was mapped in 'GDA1994 MGA Zone 55s' and transformed to GDA2020 MGA Zone 55s.\nCredits: Rob Muller (NSW OEH), Wayne Cook (NSW OEH), Allan Nicholson (NSW DPI), Alie Cowood (UC)\nDisclaimer: While all care is taken to ensure accuracy, the ACT Government does not warrant that the map is free from error.",

    "description": "Interim Biogeographic Regionalisation for Australia (IBRA) version 6.1 represents a landscape based approach to classifying the land surface of Australia.  85 biogeographic regions and 405 sub regions have been delineated, each reflecting a unifying set of major environmental influences which shape the occurrence of flora and fauna and their interaction with the physical environment across Australia.  \nThe IBRA Version 6.1 data consists of two datasets.  IBRA bioregions, which is a larger scale regional classification of homogenous ecosystems, and sub regions, which are more localised. \n\nIBRA Version 6.1 is the result of refinement of the IBRA Version 5.1 and version 6.0 boundaries due to better data availability amongst some states and territories and also based on alterations by the states/territories along the state borders.  The refined boundaries were jointly defined by the Commonwealth, State and Territory nature and conservation agencies.  Those jurisdictions to refine their data in this version of IBRA include New South Wales, Queensland, Victoria and Western Australia.  There are 53 newly named sub regions and 5 have been renamed from version 5.1.  Whilst there has been a refinement of sub-regional and associated bioregional boundaries in Qld, Vic and western NSW, the new sub-regions are found principally in eastern NSW.  In WA changes relate to moving the western boundary of Yalgoo bioregion to the coast, truncating the northern portion of the Geraldton Sandplains bioregion.\n\nNominal attributes that make up IBRA are: climate, lithology/geology, landform, vegetation, flora and fauna, and landuse.  The use of these attributes varies across the jurisdictions and for further information individual jurisdictions should be contacted.CC - Attribution (CC BY)\nThis data has been licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Australia Licence.

    "description": "The association of FRB 200428 with the Galactic magnetar SGR 1935+2154 confirms that magnetars can power fast radio bursts (FRBs). However, FRB 200428 is 4 to 8 orders of magnitude less energetic than the typical population of cosmological FRBs. This discrepancy is likely due to the moderate magnetic field strength and evolved age of SGR 1935+2154. In contrast, newborn extragalactic magnetars, such as those formed in gamma-ray burst (GRB) central engines, are expected to have much stronger magnetic fields, more rapid spin-down, and highly dynamic magnetospheres, all of which favor the production of brighter and more frequent FRBs.\n\nWe propose a targeted search for FRBs from the recently localized GRB 230307A, a long-duration GRB with evidence suggesting the formation of a young magnetar. Given the source's relatively close distance (291 Mpc) and possible youth (less than 3 years), it offers a compelling opportunity to test FRB generation mechanisms during the early evolution of a magnetar.\n\nWe request 30 hours of observing time with the Parkes 64-m Murriyang telescope using the ultra-wideband low-frequency (UWL) receiver. Our plan includes one 10-hour long-duration session to detect rare or clustered bursts, and ten 2-hour sessions spread over 2-3 months to sample temporal variability. Data will be processed with state-of-the-art pipelines for single-pulse searches and coherent dedispersion.\n\nA detection would strongly support magnetar-origin FRB models and provide key constraints on the early-time activity of GRB-formed neutron stars.",

    "description": "This data was collected in July and August 2010 by the IMOS Ship of Opportunity Underway CO2 Measurement research group on RV Southern Surveyor (IMOS platform code: VLHJ) voyage SS062010.\n\nDeparted:  Fremantle Australia, July 29, 2010\nArrived:  \t Fremantle, Australia, August 9, 2010\n\nCO2 System Overview:\nThe fugacity of carbon dioxide (fCO2) in surface seawater was measured using a General Oceanics Inc. automated system (Model 8050; Pierrot et al 2009). Seawater is sprayed into an equilibration chamber and CO2 in the headspace gas equilibrates with the seawater. The headspace gas is pumped through a thermoelectric condenser followed by a nafion drying tube before flowing through a Licor 7000 non-dispersive infrared gas analyser used to measure the CO2 mole fraction (XCO2) of the dried air. The gas flow is stopped temporarily for the CO2 measurements, which are made at atmospheric pressure. A set of four CO2 standards that cover the range of CO2 values expected in the ocean are analysed about every four hours to calibrate the gas analyser. The standard gas concentrations are on the WMO-X2007 mole fraction scale for CO2-in-air. Atmospheric XCO2 (dry) is measured after the standards by pumping clean outside air from an intake on the forward mast of the ship. \n\nSeawater intake and ancillary data:\nThe seawater intake is located at about 5.5m depth in the bow of the ship. Sea surface salinity is measured using a thermosalinograph (Seabird Electronics SBE21) located next to the CO2 system. A remote temperature sensor (Seabird Electronics SBE 38) located at the intake is used to measure sea surface temperature (SST). The travel time between the intake and CO2 system is typically about 4 minutes with warming usually less than 0.6ºC. The thermosalinograph water is from the same intake, but the supply lines separate after the intake. A comparison of thermosalinograph and equilibrator temperature records shows the temperature difference in the two lines is generally less than 0.1ºC. The thermosalinograph water line travels outside the ship and is typically warmer than the equilibrator. The travel time in water line to the thermosalinograph is 2.5 minutes faster than to the equilibrator. \n\nMeteorological data, salinity, SST, and ships position and time are taken from the ships logging system. These parameters and the data quality are maintained by the Australian Marine National Facility.",

    "description": "The area tested by drilling comprises approximately 30 acres of the Parish of Cullen Bullen in the County of Roxburgh, and is immediately to the east of the Portland-Mudgee railway line about 1.5 miles northward from Cullen Bullen Station. The purpose of drilling was to test the Irondale and Lithgow seams of the Upper Coal-Measures for thickness and quality, and thus determine whether or not the more detailed investigation of proving is warranted. Seven holes, with an average depth of 116 feet, were drilled by Goldfields Diamond Drilling Co. under contract to the bureau of near sites chosen by the Geological Survey of N.S.W. The total footage drilled was 810 feet and coal-core recovery averaged 89%. Core drilling in the Tyldesley Area has indicated the presence of 41,000 tons of banded high-ash coal in the lower split of the Lithgow Seam. The coal is considered unsuitable for exploitation by open cut methods and a proving campaign is not recommended.",

The data spans every two years between 2012-2016 and is aggregated to 2015 Department of Health Primary Health Network (PHN) areas, based on the 2011 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nThe Child and Maternal Health Indicators have been calculated from the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare (AIHW) National Mortality Database and Register of Births and National Perinatal Data Collection. This measure has been calculated with the numerator as the total number of mothers who smoked during pregnancy, and the denominator as the total number of mothers with a stated smoking status.\nFor further information about this dataset, visit the data source:Australian Institute of Health and Welfare - Child and Maternal Health Data Tables.\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data using the Department of Health - PHN Areas.\n\n\nData at the area level exclude births to Australian non-residents and women who could not be allocated because their usual residence was not stated or was not valid.\n\n\nA woman's smoking status during pregnancy is self-reported.\n\n\nPercentage for an area are suppressed for publication and marked as 'NP' if the number of mothers with a stated smoking  status for the area is less than 100.\n\n",

    "description": "This spatial layer was created to support the identification of areas important to the Grey-headed Flying-fox in the Lower Hunter to facilitate a review of the Lower Hunter Regional Strategy and Regional Conservation Plan. It does this by prioritising areas of high conservation value foraging habitat for conservation to support impact assessment and identification of priority areas for offsetting. This spatial layer is limited to the Lower Hunter (Port Stephens, Maitland, Cessnock, Lake Macquarie and Newcastle Local Government Areas).\n\n* The GIS mapping data were obtained to inform sustainability planning for the Lower Hunter region, particularly to assist in informing the NSW Government review of the NSW Lower Hunter regional strategy and Lower Hunter regional conservation plan.\n* Once this review is complete, the second stage is to undertake a strategic assessment of proposed urban development and related infrastructure corridors.

    "description": "    \n\nRelative Yield From Acidity (%) dataset is one of 11 national surfaces,\nrepresented by ~1km grids, relating to economic opportunities associated with\nsoil condition. All dollar values are given in 1996/97 Australian dollars.\nThere are three sub-types of data in this dataset: relative yields, gross\nbenefits and impact costs. Each is described as follows:1. Relative yield\n(RY): This is the yield of the crop or pasture, relative to its full potential\nexpressed as a percentage. It is equal to actual yield divided by potential\nyield. The relative yield surfaces, measured as a ratio (0 to 1) and\nrepresented with a 1km grid, include: * ry_salt2000; ry_salt2020: The relative\nyield of salinity in the year 2000 and 2020* ry_Acid; ry_Esp: The relative\nyield from soil acidity and soil sodicity* ry_min: The limiting factor\nrelative yield a minimum of ry_salt2000, ry_acid, ry_esp and ry_min.*\nlim_fact:Factor most limiting yield a of acidity, sodicity and salinity 2.\nGross benefit (GB): The gross benefit is the additional profit at full equity\nattainable through agricultural production if the yield-limiting factor of\nsalinity, acidity or sodicity were repaired without cost. As such it can be\nconsidered an approximate investment ceiling on treating the soil. The gross\nbenefit grids are measured in $/ha/yr and include:* gb97a; gb97e; gb97s a for\nsoil acidity; sodicity; salinity* gb97m a the combined limiting factor gross\nbenefit. 3. Impact cost (ic97s): This is the decline in agricultural profit at\nfull equity due to worsening dryland salinity severity and extent over the\ntime period 2000 to 2020. It is measured in $/ha/yr. It is determined only\nthrough changes in crop yield as a consequence of changes in dryland salinity.\nImpact cost can be considered the loss in profit at full equity due to\nworsening salinity over the 20yr time period. Keywords: Economics, Natural\nResources, Australia, Salinity, Sodicity, Acidity, Soil TreatmentData is in\nalbers and unprojected, using WGS84 and GDA94.\n\nSee [further metadata](http://data.daff.gov.au/anrdl/metadata_files/pa_easc_r9cl\n__08312a07.xml) for more detail.\n\n",

    "description": "The <strong>Climate Vulnerability Assessment</strong> was designed to provide an overview of the impact of future climate change on all stages of production for the commodities and biosecurity risks assessed. The project used multicriteria analysis (MCA) models to produce assessments for the commodities and biosecurity risks in a consistent and comparable way, and a framework was developed to provide a rigorous, flexible and transparent process for assessing vulnerabilities and opportunities to climate change. Details of the approach and the climate data used in the assessments can be found in the <a href=\"https://www.dpi.nsw.gov.au/dpi/climate/climate-vulnerability-assessment/publications-and-reports\">Methodology Report</a> which also details model exclusions and assumptions.\n\nAssessments were undertaken on commodities grouped into 6 nodes: <em>Horticulture and Viticulture</em>, <em>Broadacre Cropping</em>, <em>Forestry</em>, <em>Extensive Livestock</em>, <em>Marine Fisheries</em>, as well as for a set of biosecurity risks related to these primary industry sectors. The <a href=\"https://www.dpi.nsw.gov.au/dpi/climate/climate-vulnerability-assessment/publications-and-reports\">Summary Report</a> gives details of the chosen commodities and biosecurity risks and summarises the high-level results.\n\nResults Reports for each commodity and biosecurity risk are being released. Visit the <a href=\"https://www.dpi.nsw.gov.au/dpi/climate/climate-vulnerability-assessment\">project's web pages</a> to access these reports and for further information.\n\nThis dataset contains maps of modelled climate suitability for the <strong>dryland canola</strong> model in the Broadacre Cropping node of the DPIRD Climate Vulnerability Assessment. Maps are provided (in GeoTIFF format) for each element of the model: the overall climate suitability, climate suitability maps for each phenophase and also for each phenophase/climate variable combination in the model. Data is provided for each of the eight global climate models (GCMs) used in the project, as well as the climate suitability derived from historical observations, along with the ensemble median for each map.",

    "description": "Magnetars are neutron stars with exceptionally high magnetic fields. From the 30 known magnetars, only six have had radio emission detected so far. The remaining 24 magnetars are generally only searched for radio emission after an X-ray outburst. This added a strong selection bias to whether magnetars are radio loud or not. From the known six radio loud magnetars, we know that the radio emission changes quickly with time and for the magnetar XTE J1810-197, it has been observed that the radio flux increases strongly without an enhancement in X-ray flux. Thus, it remains unclear whether the radio quiet magnetars are in fact radio quiet and the radio X-ray relation appears to be rather complex.\n  In this proposal, we propose a regular monitoring campaign of 4 radio quiet magnetars with bi-weekly observations using the Parkes UWL receiver. For 3 of the sources, we will have accompanying X-ray observations and thus, this will give an unique data set to probe the relation between radio and X-ray independent outbursts. Any detection of radio emission, i.e. single pulses or folded profiles, would be a major discovery and help to constrain the emission mechanisms of magnetars. This will also help to improve the understanding of the emission mechanism of fast radio bursts. However, also a non-detection of radio emission will provide upper limits that serve as a baseline before any future outburst of the observed magnetars as well as allow to constrain the formation process of magnetars in contrast to pulsars.",

    "description": "During 1951 three separate sets of La Cour pattern Quartz Horizontal Magnetometers were received from the Danish Meteorological Institute. These instruments which are only semi-absolute, were calibrated at the Rude Skov Magnetic Observatory against the standard adopted by that observatory. As the Australian observatories are based on the International Magnetic Standard housed at Cheltenham near Washington, U.S.A. (hereinafter referred to as I.M.S.) it was decided to compare them against the Toolangi magnetometer as soon as possible after their arrival in Australia. Moreover, as the stability of these instruments depends on the torsion properties of a quartz fibre and on the magnetic moment of a magnet, regular comparisons should be made with an absolute magnetometer and the results used to control drift that might occur. The comparisons made immediately after the arrival of the instruments in Australia would thus constitute a starting point in the future control of the Q.H.Ms. [An account is given of work done between 1951 and 1952. Results are appended.]",

    "title": "Intertidal Marine Vegetation Strategies (IMVS)",
    "description": "The Intertidal Marine Vegetation Strategies (IMVS) are products of the NSW Marine Estate Management Strategy (MEMS). The separate reports and data packages cover the floodplains of NSW estuaries. The first IMVS covers the Tweed River estuary, and as IMVS for other estuaries and marine parks are released, the datasets will be added to SEED. The IMVS, supporting documents and geodata packages are centralised information sources to aid management of saltmarsh and mangrove habitats in NSW now and into the future.\n\nMapping of high macrophyte potential and identification of intertidal marine vegetation ‘hotspots’ where management actions may be meaningfully undertaken applies the methods outlined in the Marine Vegetation Management Strategies: a framework for estuary wide prioritization of protection and rehabilitation. This publication outlines the theoretical processes behind the applied prioritisation approach and provides comprehensive detail and justification on the study approach and methods used. \n\nEach estuary or marine park specific IMVS identifies macrophyte potential hotspots where a tailored suite of management actions has been developed to increase the resilience of intertidal marine vegetation. Actions address key threats and risks to saltmarsh and mangrove communities to safeguard the ongoing provision of ecosystem services and environmental, social, cultural, and economic values in response to sea level rise and other impacts. Importantly, a landholders’ right to carry out agricultural or developmental activities on their land is not altered by their properties being identified in any IMVS documents and any involvement in delivering recommended management actions is entirely voluntary.\n\nThe IMVS includes information on recommended management actions categorised under Hydrology, Sediments, Vegetation and People and Planning approaches. More detailed information on the objectives and suitability of these management approaches can be found in the following documents:\n\nIMVS: Key approaches to Mitigate Risk and Support Adaptation \n\nIMVS: Integrated Landscape and Seascape Conservation\n\nIMVS: Weed Management Guide.\n\nNote that the recommendations are based on site-specific conditions and available information at the time of writing. As both environmental and anthropogenic conditions are dynamic, appropriate management strategies may be subject to change and current site assessments are required. Initiating changes to protect or restore hydrology or sedimentation may be complex and have unanticipated environmental, social, cultural and economic outcomes. When recommended projects are planned, expert assessment and a scrutiny of proposed actions by relevant authorities is still warranted as works may result in changes to the key ecological drivers of intertidal wetlands.\n\nImplementation of recommended actions must comply with regulatory requirements. Proposal assessments must be undertaken on a case-by-case basis as the approval pathway is not the same for every relevant Local Environmental Plan or SEPP. The planning approval pathway also depends on how a proposal is classified, the specific works to be undertaken, the location and land zoning, and whether the proponent is a public authority or private entity. There may also be other regulatory approvals that apply. Given the complexities of jurisdiction and classifications of works it is important to seek and retain written planning advice (for example, from a town planner and relevant approval authorities) during the planning stage so that environmental protection actions can be demonstrated as being compliant with current legislation and policy.\n\nThe geodata packages include information on high macrophyte potential, identified hotspots, recommended management actions (under Hydrology; Sediments; Vegetation; and People and Planning approaches), current mapped intertidal macrophytes, and projected intertidal vegetation with 0.5m and 1.5 m sea level rise.  Links to relevant resources are also provided.\n\nThe IMVS datasets for the following study areas can be accessed in the Related Datasets section below.",

    "description": "This dataset was collected as part of the City of Melbourne's Census of Land Use and Employment (CLUE). The data shows the number of business establishments per city (CLUE) block, classified by their CLUE industry (from ANZSIC) and small area allocation. The data is aggregated to the 2016 Blocks for CLUE Boundaries and covers the year period of 2012.\nA business establishment is defined as a \n\n\nCommercial occupant in a building\n\n\nSeparate land use\n\n\nAny permanent presence of economic activity in accordance with standard Industry classification (ANZSIC).\n\n\nHence, if one organisation has its presence in several buildings in the CLUE area, each time it will be counted as a separate establishment. Consequently, the count of establishments presented in CLUE represents the number of locations, rather than 'enterprises'.\nFor more information please visit the City of Melbourne CLUE Portal and ABS ANZSIC Page.\nPlease note: \n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the data acquired through the City of Melbourne Open Data Portal.\n\n\nThe individual yearly tables have been extracted from the archived 2002-2017 tables.\n\n\nThe data in this table is a snapshot and not live.\n\n",

    "title": "Native Bees Remnant Patches",
    "description": "Urban Habitat Connectivity Project (UHCP)\n\nShort description: A package of data containing potential habitat and fragmentation for seven species groups in the urban ACT. Each species group has two layer files. Connected habitat layers show potential core and corridor habitat for the species group, and connectivity/fragmentation between these habitat patches. Remnant patches layers contain areas which are predicted to be fragmented and inaccessible for the species group, but may be important for restoration activities. These layers are outputs of ecological connectivity modelling and have been developed using spatial data representing habitat and connectivity requirements specific to the species group.\n\nThe following attributes are available in the data table for Connected Habitat layers:\n\n\n<ul><li>Species Group* - indicates the species group of interest</li><li>Patch ID – a unique identifier for each ‘patch’ of connected habitat, an ID that is given to group all habitat areas which are predicted to be connected to each other.</li><li>Habitat Type* – identifies if the polygon meets core or corridor habitat requirements, or if it is a remnant patch.</li><li>Habitat Number – a numeric value linked to Habitat Type to support statistics and symbology. Core habitat has a value of 0 and corridor habitat has a value of 1.</li><li>Patch Area (Ha)* – the area of the individual polygon in hectares.</li><li>Connected Habitat Area (Ha) – the total area of potential habitat in the connected patch, determined by summing the Patch Area for all polygons with the same Patch ID.</li><li>Shape area – the polygon’s area, calculated by default in meters squared.</li><li>Shape length – the length of the line enclosing the polygon, calculated by default in meters squared.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n* Is also available in the data table for Remnant Patches layers.\n\nSpatial resolution: 1:10,000\n\nCoordinate system: GDA2020 MGA zone 55\n\nMETHODS\n\nData collection / creation: <a>Spatial layers for habitat and barriers were created and input into a habitat connectivity/fragmentation model specifically designed for the species group. The model was developed using metrics derived from expert elicitation. These metrics quantified essential habitat and connectivity requirements for the species group, for example the preferred spacing of trees, the maximum crossable width of a road, the typical dispersal distance, etc. </a>The model identified habitat and barriers to connectivity, based on the metrics which could be mapped. Habitat was delineated by patch size to determine core and corridor habitat, and to remove areas which are too small to be functional. The habitat type is visible in the attribute table of the data.\n\nConnectivity between habitat patches is dependent on the species group’s dispersal capacity and the availability of core habitat, suitable corridors and a path without barriers. To assess this core habitat areas were buffered by the species group’s dispersal distance. This identified how far an individual will move to find a new core habitat patch. Movement to this distance is dependent on a suitable path. All habitat was buffered by the distance the species can move outside habitat (through non-habitat areas). This identified how far an individual will move outside any habitat (core or corridor) before they require another habitat patch (i.e. how far they can travel between stepping stones).Connectivity is further complicated by impassable barriers. Barriers were used to slice up the dispersal buffers and identify ‘dispersal patches’, areas which an individual can move within. Fragmentation is seen when a barrier is present, patches are too far from core habitat, or corridor habitat is too far apart.\n\nA unique ID was applied to each patch and represents connectivity/fragmentation. The patches were intersected with habitat to apply the new ID to the habitat areas. The final model outputs identify areas of potential core, corridor or remnant (inaccessible) habitat. Core and corridor habitat are viewable in the connected habitat dataset, whilst remnant patches are available separately. The data was simplified using the Douglas-Peuker algorithm, a tolerance of 0.5-2m, minimum size of 2-5m2 for retention, and holes filled in if less than 20m2. Small adjoining slithers &lt;20m2 were dissolved into neighbouring polygons to optimise drawing speeds. Please contact the project team for the model script or further details on the methodology.\n\nNOTES ON USE\n\nQuality: The habitat connectivity modelling used to produce the data was informed by work by the City of Melbourne <a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/331035992_Linking_Nature_in_the_City_A_framework_for_improving_ecological_connectivity_across_the_City_of_Melbourne\">(Kirk et al., 2018)</a>. The original methods were expanded on, with habitat and connectivity requirements (metrics) specific to the species group determined from expert elicitation and further analysis to consider patch size for core or corridor patches. The expert elicitation process provided the best and most relevant quantitative description of habitat and barriers available (for a species group rather than a specific species). The input datasets were then tailored to the metrics for this project. Existing datasets were refined to be relevant and reflect the metrics identified through expert elicitation. New datasets were created where data was missing. All data was derived from existing authoritative sources and/or remotely sensed data. This data curation process ensured the input datasets, and resulting output, were relevant and fit for purpose.\n\nLimitations: This data should be considered indicative only as there are limitations to the modelling process. It considers all habitat and barriers equally and as discrete objects (i.e. it applies a discrete boundary around a patch and does not account for gradients or flexible boundaries).The model predicts habitat and connectivity based on the data available. It does not assess whether a species is present or consider temporal variability. Some habitat requirements are not mapped (e.g. native vegetation, lack of predators) due to the lack of an accurate or complete dataset. Some of these requirements are critical to the success of the species group. These habitat requirements are available and have been derived from expert elicitation. They should be considered at an area of interest.\n\nThe model assumes the input data is up to date and accurate. Many of the habitat and barrier datasets used as inputs into the models are in some way informed by remote sensing data. Remote sensing data has limitations, such as potential for misclassification (e.g. bare ground and pavement could be confused). Additionally, remotely sensed data captures a point in time and will become outdated. Manual checks and improvements using supplementary data for specific sites have been completed to reduce as much error as possible.\n\nData refinement: Unmapped habitat and connectivity requirements should be considered when using the data. The full list of known habitat and connectivity requirements for each species group, including those considered by the model and those unaccounted for, is available by request. Other data may also be used to track changes post-LiDAR capture. For example, new development footprints may be used to remove non-habitat areas and can be done so at a faster rate than waiting for new LiDAR captures and re-running the model.\n\n\n\nSHARING\n\nLicenses/restrictions on use: Creative Commons By Attribution 4.0 (Australian Capital Territory)\n\nHow to cite this data: ACT Government, 2023.

    "title": "Pest animal and Weed Management Survey: National landholder survey results",
    "description": "Overview  \r\n Established pests and weeds represent a high ongoing cost to Australian agriculture. The Australian Government has invested $50 million through the Australian Competitiveness White Paper to improve the way pest animals and weeds are managed and to increase the capacity of farmers to deal with these threats. This is through investment in projects that: develop new and improved control tools and technologies; improve land manager awareness and access to control tools and technologies; improve land manager knowledge of best practice pest animal and weed management; and increase land manager and community participation in pest animal and weed management activities. \r\n\r\n To enable the Department of Agriculture and Water Resources to evaluate outcomes of this investment, baseline data is required to provide a national overview of the status and management of established pest animals and weeds. Currently, there is insufficient data available to establish the baseline. Therefore a national survey of agricultural land managers was undertaken to collect data on pest animal and weed status, impacts and management actions at the property and local area levels. \r\n\r\n This report presents the results of responses from 6470 agricultural land managers, representing broadacre, dairy, horticulture and other livestock industries across all natural resource management regions in Australia. \r\n\r\n Key Issues  \r\n Nearly 80 per cent of respondents were actively managing a pest animal, and 85 per cent were actively managing weeds on their property in the last 12 months. \r\n\r\n Shooting and ground baiting continue to be widely used tools for vertebrate pest management. Herbicide is used by 90 per cent of landholders in the management of weeds and reported as effective by the vast majority. \r\n\r\n The majority of respondents reported that pest animal and weed control methods they were using were at least moderately effective. \r\n\r\n Agricultural businesses spend a significant amount on managing pest animals and weeds. An average of $19,620 was spent per agricultural business on undertaking pest animal and weed management activities. This include pest animal and weed management related expenditure on traps, baits, herbicides, pesticides/insecticides, fuel, fencing materials, and labour (including the cost of contractors) on the property in the last 12 months. \r\n• For those managing pest animals they spend an average of $7,023 per year (pest animals including feral, natives, insects and other pests (for example, parasites and mites)). \r\n• Agricultural businesses spend an average of $17,917 per year on weed management activities, this includes all activities undertaken as part of the businesses’ usual production cycle activities, for example spraying weeds before planting a crop. \r\n Pest animal and weed control activities took an average of 77 person days per agricultural business by owners/operators (including family members) and 39 person days by contractors, employees and other people (for example, volunteers) in the last 12 months. \r\n\r\n Nearly eight per cent of landholders were members of a pest animal or weed management group. The majority of the groups had developed a plan for coordinating management activities or collaborating with other stakeholders. \r\n\r\n A majority of land managers reported: new and improved control methods; access to information on control options and methods; more management activities by other land managers (private and public); and better access to biological controls as important actions that could improve pest animal and weed management.

    "description": "This dataset is a component of the 'Jervis Bay Baseline Studies' project conducted by the Department of Defence, CSIRO and the Australian Defence Force Academy.\n\nThe meteorological station (35.133S, 150.762E) recorded winds and atmospheric pressure at Governor Head (Jervis Bay). The site is several hundred metres inland of 50m high cliffs and is 63m above sea-level.\n\nThis record provides wind statistics for October 1989. Five datasets are included here representing different times of the day: 0000-0550, 0600-1150, 1200-1750 and 1800-2350. Individual measurements have been converted so that trends of wind speed and direction can be seen for the time period in question. The fifth dataset incorporates all the wind data collected irrespective of time providing a monthly summary. The station initially recorded wind data at 10 minute intervals.\n\nThis is one of thirty-six child records that relate to the parent, 629051e0-2b7b-11dd-a343-00188b4c0af8. A pdf outlining the structure and hierarchy of metadata records relating to the 'Jervis Bay Baseline Studies' project is available to download through this record. Meteorological data was collected to investigate wind forced circulation in Jervis Bay, NSW.",

These areas have been underserved because of their high cost, difficult terrain and lower population densities.\r\n\r\nFor more information on PUMP go to https://www.infrastructure.gov.au/pump",

    "description": "The digital State Boundaries and their legal identifiers have been derived from the cadastre data from each state and territory jurisdiction and are available below.\r\n\r\nState Boundaries are part of Geoscape Administrative Boundaries, which is built and maintained by  [Geoscape Australia](https://geoscape.com.au/) using authoritative government data. Further information about contributors to Administrative Boundaries is available [here](https://geoscape.com.au/legal/data-copyright-and-disclaimer/).\r\n\r\nThe full Administrative Boundaries dataset contains boundaries in seven themes: Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) boundaries, electoral boundaries, state and territory boundaries, local government areas, suburbs/localities, wards and town points.\r\n\r\nAs at November 2019, users have the option to download datasets with feature coordinates referencing the new Geocentric Datum of Australia 2020 (GDA2020) in addition to datasets on the GDA94 datum.\r\n\r\nFor GDA2020 datasets, the name of the zip folder and the root folder (once extracted) include a reference to GDA2020. For GDA94 datasets, the zip and root folder names do not contain the datum name (i.e. they remain the same as previous releases).\r\n\r\nFor example, the zip and root folder for Administrative Boundaries downloaded in GDA2020 for November 2019 looks like this:\r\n\r\n       •\tNOV19_AdminBounds_ESRIShapefileorDBFfile_GDA2020; or \r\n       •\tNOV19_AdminBounds_MapInfoTABFormat_GDA2020\r\n\r\nThe zip and root folder for Administrative Boundaries in GDA94 for November 2019 looks like this: \r\n\r\n       •\tNOV19_AdminBounds_ESRIShapefileorDBFfile; or \r\n       •\tNOV19_AdminBounds_MapInfoTABFormat\r\n\r\nIrrespective of the datum chosen, files within the respective folder use exactly the same naming structures.\r\n\r\nFurther information on Administrative Boundaries, including FAQs on the data, is available [here](https://geoscape.com.au/data/administrative-boundaries/) through Geoscape Australia’s network of [partners](https://geoscape.com.au/partners/). They provide a range of commercial products based on Administrative Boundaries, including software solutions, consultancy and support.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## License Information\r\n\r\nThe Australian Government has negotiated the release of Administrative Boundaries to the whole economy under an [open CCBY 4.0 license](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).\r\n\r\nUsers must only use the data in ways that are consistent with the Australian Privacy Principles issued under the Privacy Act 1988 (Cth).\r\n\r\n**Users must also note the following attribution requirements:**\r\n\r\n_Preferred attribution for the Licensed Material:_\r\n\r\n> _Administrative Boundaries © [Geoscape Australia](https://geoscape.com.au/legal/data-copyright-and-disclaimer/) licensed by the Commonwealth of Australia under_ [_Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International licence (CC BY 4.0)_](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).\r\n\r\n_Preferred attribution for Adapted Material:_\r\n\r\n> _Incorporates or developed using Administrative Boundaries © [Geoscape Australia](https://geoscape.com.au/legal/data-copyright-and-disclaimer/) licensed by the Commonwealth of Australia under_ [_Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International licence (CC BY 4.0)_](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).\r\n",

    "description": "This dataset presents the footprint of the number of installations of solar water heater (SWH) air source heat pump systems. The data spans the months of 2013 and includes a total for the year. The data is aggregated to Postal Areas (POAs) from the 2016 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nEvery month the Clean Energy Regulator (CER) publishes small-scale renewable energy installation data files. These data files provide a list of small generation units (SGU) (small-scale solar panel, wind and hydro systems) and kW capacity by installed postcode, and SWH and air source heat pumps by installed postcode. The data represents all systems that have had certificates validly created against them. The data includes new installations, upgrades to existing systems and stand-alone (off-grid) systems. This data is not publicly available via the Renewable Energy Certificate (REC) Registry and does not include systems that are pending registration or have been failed by the CER.\nFor further information about this dataset, visit the data source:Clean Energy Regulator - Postcode Data for Small-scale Installations.\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data by joining the data with the 2016 ASGS POAs\n\n\nThe data is current as at 30-09-2018.\n\n\nRenewable Energy Target (RET) legislation allows a 12 month creation period for registered persons to create their certificates.\n\n\nSmall-scale technology certificates are calculated based on the life of the system. This differs for solar hot water heaters and small generation units (solar panels, wind and hydro). Further information can be found at theRenewable Energy Target FAQ.\n\n\nAir source heat pumps were introduced into the Small-scale Renewable Energy Scheme in 2005 as such there is no installation data available pre-2005 for this fuel source.\n\n",

The 333 kHz was set to passive for the duration due to an issue with the transducer. Active acquisition of the 18, 38, 70 120, and 200 kHz frequencies was sporadic throughout the voyage due to calibrations of other acoustic instruments. Dedicated acoustic interference tests were performed throughout the voyage with different frequencies on active or passive to assess the impact of other acoustic systems on the EK80 data. Details on these tests are contained within the EVERlog records. \nData are stored in .raw, .bot and *.idx format at CSIRO. There are 2428 files totalling 30.8 GB of raw data in this dataset.\nNo processing has been conducted on this data.\nAdditional information regarding this dataset is contained in the GSM data acquisition and processing report.

    "description": "This dataset is a component of the 'Jervis Bay Baseline Studies' project conducted by the Department of Defence, CSIRO and the Australian Defence Force Academy\n\nThe meteorological station (35.133S, 150.762E) recorded winds and atmospheric pressure at Governor Head (Jervis Bay). The site is several hundred metres inland of 50m high cliffs and is 63m above sea-level.\n\nThis record provides wind statistics for January 1989. Five datasets are included here representing different times of the day: 0000-0550, 0600-1150, 1200-1750 and 1800-2350. Individual measurements have been converted so that trends of wind speed and direction can be seen for the time period in question. The fifth dataset incorporates all the wind data collected irrespective of time providing a monthly summary.

    "description": "This dataset is one of a number of datasets containing geomorphological data relating to the Windmill Islands, Wilkes Land, Antarctica. The dataset comprises of a digital point coverage of glacial sediments, collected and identified from documented field observations compiled by Dr Ian D Goodwin from his own field notes as well as topographic and surface features identified and interpreted on aerial photographs taken by AUSLIG (now Geoscience Australia) in the 1993-94 field season. Each glacial sediment sample is represented as a point which is linked to a separate digital database (ie attribute tables) containing additional information. Sediment samples collected on glacial moraine ridges and along raised beach ridges and shorelines represent a chronology of glacial events/influences on the landscape. Sediment samples taken as a profiled sequence or core can be dated using radiocarbon dating to provide a chronological picture and age occurance of deglaciation and  glaciation cycles within the Windmill Islands.",

    "description": "This layer provides the boundaries of the Groundwater Catchments of Victoria and is a product of the NWC funded Secure Allocations, Future Entitlement (SAFE) Project. The Groundwater Catchments (GC) have been developed to provide complete coverage of Victoria while considering the following:\n\n(1) Reflect aquifer systems and groundwater movement; and,\n\n(2) Align with physical (i.e. surface water) and administrative boundaries where appropriate.\n\nThe GCs are aligned within Victoria’s Groundwater Basins (GB). Boundaries that related directly or in-directly to the physical characteristics of groundwater resources included groundwater flow divides, surface water flow divides, topographic divides, and geological structural features that influence aquifer extent and groundwater flow direction.\n\nAdministrative boundaries directly linked to the management of groundwater resources include:\n\nThe Victorian State Boundary (Water Act (1989);\n\nWSPA: Water Supply Protection Area (formally declared under provisions of the Act);\n\nGMA: Groundwater Management Area (described and lodged as a plan with the Central Plan Office);\n\nRWC: Rural Water Corporation administration areas - Grampians Wimmera Mallee Water (GWMWater), Goulburn Murray Water (GMW), Lower Murray Water (LMW) and Southern Rural Water (SRW); and\n\nMDBA: Murray Darling Basin Authority (Federal Water Act (2007)).\n\nThe description of water resource management is often described in terms of surface water and groundwater.  In reality, the two resources are connected; however there are differing degrees of interconnection depending on the groundwater system and location within the surface water catchment. In preparing the Groundwater Catchments (GC), surface water catchments were directly considered. The key surface water boundaries considered are:\n\nVictorian Sustainable Diversion Limits (SDL) Catchment boundaries;\nBureau of Meteorology (2011) Surface Water Basins (Australian Hydrological Geospatial Framework, product suite v2 2011);\nVictorian Surface Water Basin Catchment (Australia’s River Basin, 1997); and,\nGeoscience Australia (500 sqkm) National Nested Catchment.",

The concentration of phytoplankton is influenced by the nutrients in the water and the amount of nutrients is thought to alter according to the urban and industrial wastes that drain from the city of Sydney.    \nThe amount of phytoplankton before and after rainfall at Pyrmont in Sydney Harbour was observed. The concentration of chlorophyll after a period of rainfall from the 15th October to the 4th November 2004, as measured from the surface to 7m deep, was almost 5 times as much as that as before the rain event. The maximum chlorophyll concentration observed by fluorometer was 27 [ug/litre].",

Orthophotos combine the image characteristics of a photograph with the geometric qualities of a map and can be used as a backdrop layer in conjunction with other spatial information.\n\n\nSpatial Resolution - 6 cm\nSpatial Accuracy - 18cm\nMap Projection - Web Mercator Auxiliary Sphere\nRectification Surface - Client supplied DTM data. Accuracy unknown\nTile Size / Grid - 1km x 1km\n\n<b>Limitations of Data</b>\nThis dataset contains imagery which has been aero-triangulated, spatially adjusted and rectified using a digital ground surface model. The stated spatial accuracy of this product is relevant for features present at ground level only. Elevated structures (roof-tops, tree canopies, etc) will be affected by relief displacement and cannot be reliably measured from this product. Spatial accuracy is reduced in areas of dense vegetation. ",

    "description": "This dataset provides daily measured streamflows into the four (4) major harvesting catchment dams in megalitres (ML). The streamflow is a calculated value which represents the observed 24-hour accumulated streamflow into the dam; net of any evaporation losses or rainfall gains from the dam surface. The streamflow measurement process requires reservior level, reservior gains and dam outflow data. The reservior level and dam outflow data is collected using telemetry devices. The reserviour levels are validated by Melbourne Water field operators. The dam outflow accounts for all water releases, including for consumption and for environmental purposes . The data is recorded at 8am daily. This data can be used in long and short-term catchment streamflow analysis.\n\n\n\nNOTE: Whilst every effort has been taken in collecting, validating and providing the attached data, Melbourne Water Corporation makes no representations or guarantees as to the accuracy or completeness of this data. Any person or group that uses this data does so at its own risk and should make their own assessment and investigations as to the suitability and/or application of the data.

    "description": "This dataset presents the footprint of the rate of hospitalisations for eye procedures per 1,000 Indigenous population by client location. The location of the client is based on their place of usual residence. The data spans the financial years between 2014-2016 and is aggregated to 2015 Department of Health Primary Health Network (PHN) areas, based on the 2011 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS). \nThe data is sourced from the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare (AIHW) - National Hospital Morbidity Database (NHMD), which is a compilation of episode-level records from admitted patient care data collection systems in Australian hospitals in each state and territory. The NHMD is based on data provided to the AIHW by state and territory health authorities for the National minimum data set (NMDS) for Admitted patient care.\nFor further information about this dataset, visit the data source: Australian Institute of Health and Welfare - Indigenous Eye Health Measures 2017 Data Tables.\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data using the Department of Health - PHN Areas.\n\n\nThe data are crude rates.\n\n\nThe data may underestimate the number of procedures provided, as they do not include those undertaken on an outpatient basis.\n\n\nData by PHN should be interpreted with caution due to variations in admission practices, and because patients may be hospitalised outside the PHN where they reside.\n\n\nThe quality of data provided for Indigenous status varies. Time-series analyses may also be affected by changes in the quality of Indigenous identification over time.\n\n",

    "description": "This technical annex provides a description of the quantitative economic model used in the report South America: an emerging competitor for Australia's beef industry. The report focuses on the beef industries of Brazil, Argentina, Uruguay, Paraguay and Australia. There are two objectives. The first is to assess the main drivers behind growth of beef exports from each country between 2000 and 2014. The second is to project the value of beef exports between 2014 and 2030 under scenarios reflecting hypothetical and actual changes to policies and operating environments. \r\n\r\n A bilateral trade decomposition model was designed to quantify the historical drivers of beef exports from Australia and its major competitors in South America, with the aim of drawing implications for projections of future bilateral trade flows. Projections are developed for the period from 2014 to 2030 that are indicative of the prospects for both regions to expand their exports under three policy scenarios. \r\n",

    "title": "Carnarvon Shelf Survey Post-Cruise Report",
    "description": "This report provides a description of the CERF Marine Biodiversity Hub's survey of the Carnarvon Shelf, Western Australia, in August and September, 2008. The survey was a collaboration between the Australian Institute of Marine Science (AIMS) and Geoscience Australia (GA) aboard RV Solander, as part of the Hub's Surrogates Program. The purpose of field surveys in the Surrogates Program is to collect high-quality, accurately co-located data to enable the robust testing of a range of physical parameters as surrogates of patterns of benthic biodiversity in strategically selected, spatially discrete areas that are representative of much broader benthic environments. \n\nThe report describes the methods employed in the survey and the datasets collected. Additional processing of most of the physical data (wave and current measurements, multibeam sonar bathymetry and backscatter, sediment grab samples, acoustic sediment profiles) and biological data (towed underwater video and stills photography, bottom sediment samples, near-bottom plankton samples) collected is required before comparative analysis between the data sets can commence. However, a number of initial interpretations of the physical data have been made and examples of the types of biota encountered in the towed video and stills photography and initial interpretations of the benthic communities encountered, are provided. The survey was focussed on three strategically selected study areas on the southern Carnarvon Shelf at Mandu, Point Cloates and Gnaraloo. A small additional area was also examined near the Muiron Islands, in the mouth of Exmouth Gulf, at the end of the survey.\n\nYou can also purchase hard copies of Geoscience Australia data and other products at http://www.ga.gov.au/products-services/how-to-order-products/sales-centre.html",

The data spans the years 2011 to 2015 and is aggregated to Statistical Area 3 (SA3) geographic boundaries based on the 2011 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nThe source of the mortality data is the Australia Cancer Database, the National Mortality Database and the National Death Index. Cause of Death Unit Record File data are provided to the AIHW by the Registries of Births, Deaths and Marriages and the National Coronial Information System (managed by the Victorian Department of Justice) and include cause of death coded by the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS). The data are maintained by AIHW in the National Mortality Database.\nFor more information, please visit the data source: AIHW - Cancer incidence and mortality in Australia by small geographic areas.\nPlease note: \n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data.\n\n\nColorectal deaths presented are underestimates. For further information on complexities in the measurement of bowel cancer in Australia, refer to the Australian Bureau of Statistics.\n\n\nWhere records are null, data was not publishable because of small numbers, confidentiality or other concerns about the quality of the data.\n\n",

The mooring is located at Latitude:-32, Longitude: 115.416.\n\nPhysical sampling will be undertaken at each of the reference stations on a monthly basis. The physical samples will be analysed for nutrients, plankton species, both visibly and genetically, and pCO2. Biological sampling will greatly improve Australia's capability to meet its obligations for ecosystem based management and allow many researchers the opportunity to investigate possible long term changes in ecology that are likely to be linked to climate variability and wide scale validation of remotely sensed (satellite) observations of plant biomass.",

    "description": "This dataset presents the footprint of the percentage of live births that were of low birthweight from Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander mothers. The data spans every two years between 2012-2016 and is aggregated to 2015 Department of Health Primary Health Network (PHN) areas, based on the 2011 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nThe Child and Maternal Health Indicators have been calculated from the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare (AIHW) National Mortality Database and Register of Births and National Perinatal Data Collection. This measure has been calculated with the numerator as the total number of low birthweight liveborn singleton babies from Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander mothers, and the denominator as the total number of live births from Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander mothers.\nFor further information about this dataset, visit the data source:Australian Institute of Health and Welfare - Child and Maternal Health Data Tables.\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data using the Department of Health - PHN Areas.\n\n\nThis dataset uses the World Health Organisation (WHO) definition of a low birthweight baby as weighing less than 2,500 grams.\n\n\nData at the area level exclude births to Australian non-residents and women who could not be allocated because their usual residence was not stated or was not valid.\n\n\nMultiple births and stillbirths have been excluded.\n\n\nPercentage for an area are suppressed for publication and marked as 'NP' if the total number of liveborn singleton babies for the area is less than 100.\n\n",

    "description": "Derived from the Vegetation Trend dataset, the Vegetation Trend Class product, is a simplified one-band summary of the linear vegetation cover trend over specific time periods broken into five classes chosen from inspection for the south west agricultural zone only. The classes have been determined by numeric changes in the linear trend index without ground or ecological interpretation, and may be interpreted tentatively as follows for the pixel values indicated; 1 - major increase in vegetation density over the entire period, 2 - increasing trend, 3 - no major change, 4 - decreasing trend and 5 - major decreasing trend.\n\nClick <a href=\"https://data.wa.gov.au/land-monitor\">here</a> for more information.",

The data is based on the recipient's geocoded address aggregated by Statistical Area Level 2 (SA2) from the Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS) 2011.\nThe Department of Social Services (DSS) is the Australian Government's lead agency in the development and delivery of social policy, and is working to improve the lifetime wellbeing of people and families in Australia. DSS' policies and services respond to need across people's lives - looking after families, children and older people; providing a safety net for people who cannot fully support themselves; enhancing the wellbeing of people with high needs; assisting people who need help with care; and supporting a diverse and harmonious society. DSS supports people and families in Australia by encouraging independence and participation, and supporting a cohesive society.\nFor more information on this dataset please visit the Australian Government Open Data.\nFor further details on payments, see 'A guide to Australian Government payments'.\nPlease note:\n\n\nIn order to protect individuals' privacy, identified populations between 1 and 19 have been suppressed and replaced with '&lt;20' for confidentiality purposes. Additional data may be suppressed and replaced with 'n.p.'

Samples were separated into different size fractions to determine the % of each grainsize at each sample depth. Although not overly accurate, the information is correlated with analyses of other parameters to impart clues to the environmental changes within the core. The smallest size fraction (<100µm) dominates at all depths. There are small peaks in the coarser grained material at the bottom of the core which relate to pteropod layers in the sediment.",

    "description": "    \n\nMean annual (00) and monthly (01a|12) transpiration (mm) from the plant canopy\nfor the period 1980-1999.Interpretation:Canopy transpiration is far more\nspatially variable than potential evaporation, reflecting the effects of water\nlimitation in most areas of the continent. Both the annual mean and seasonal\npattern broadly resemble the corresponding patterns for rainfall. Canopy\ntranspiration maps have more acontrasta (relative variation) than the total\nevaporation or rainfall maps because transpiration is a small component of\ntotal evaporation in areas of low plant cover (the remainder being soil\nevaporation).The partitioning between soil evaporation and canopy\ntranspiration in the model is determined by leaf area index.Notes: These are\nmodel-based estimates from the BiosEquil model. Results are given for the\naBASEa (pre-1788) and aAGRICa (present day) conditions. The aAGRICa case\nincludes current agricultural inputs of water from\nirrigation.EvapCanopy.00.Agric, EvapCanopy.01.Agric a| EvapCanopy.12.Agric a\nMean annual and monthly canopy transpiration (mm) in the aAGRICa (present day)\nscenarioEvapCanopy.00.Base, EvapCanopy.01.Base a| EvapCanopy.12.Base a Mean\nannual and monthly canopy transpiration (mm) in the aBASEa (pre-1788)\nscenarioData is in geographics and GDA94.\n\nSee [further metadata](http://data.daff.gov.au/anrdl/metadata_files/pa_ctab_r9cl\n__01411a18.xml) for more detail.\n\n",

    "description": "Data Notes:\n\n\nData is derived from the National Schools Statistics Collection (NSSC), which is managed by the Australian Bureau of Statistics. \n\n\nEnrolments are full-time equivalent (FTE). For the purposes of reporting, only students in Year 11 and 12 may be part-time. Hence there is no difference between \"full-time\" and \"full-time equivalent\" enrolments for K-10 or ungraded in NSW government schools.                \n\n\nUngraded students are students who are not assigned to a particular grade. These students are often enrolled in support classes or schools for specific purposes (SSPs). From 2020, only support students in SSPs are recorded as ungraded.                               \n\n\nIf a school has a total FTE enrolment greater than 5 for all its grades, then the grade-level FTE data is published. \n\n\nIf a school has a total FTE enrolment equal to or less than 5, the grade-level FTE data is suppressed and only the school level FTE data is published. Where only one grade at a school had a value of &lt;=5, the ungraded cell has also been suppressed for privacy reasons. Where there are no ungraded students, the grade with the next lowest total is also suppressed.\n\n\nData Source:\n\nEducation Statistics and Measurement Unit, Centre for Education Statistics and Evaluation.\n",

    "description": "This dataset estimates human mobility through origin destination (OD) movement flow among the Statistical Area 2 (SA2) regions in Queensland (QLD), connected by public transport (PT) networks. The SA2 regions of Queensland connected by buses, trains, trams and ferries have been used to evaluate OD movement flows. The passenger OD movement data among different stations (or the station-based OD flow) are first estimated using a statistical estimation methodology. The stations-based OD flow data are then translated into region-based OD matrices using the state-of-art method. For more information please see the original metadata file here.\nHuman mobility data is a key ingredient in various areas and domains of research including epidemiology, policy and administration, criminology, transportation, logistics and supply chains, environmental management and, pollution and contamination. High quality human mobility data provided by telecommunication companies collected from call data records (CDRs) is available at prohibitive cost with restrictive licensing, keeping it out of reach for the majority of research community. On the other hand, there is an abundance of high-quality public data, reporting different aspects of mobility. Examples are the public transport patronage and information about the usage of the Australian road network. These datasets are collected by different organisations and government departments and are presented in various formats. For instance, data may be collected at different spatial (e.g. at state or postcode levels) and temporal scales and be presented in the form of passenger counts or aggregated movement flows. This dataset addresses the general lack of national scale comprehensive human mobility dataset in Australia by transforming available mobility data into a consistent format that is suitable for analysis in a broad range of research areas. Merging the various individual datasets into Australia's first comprehensive, national-scale human mobility data asset drastically improves the quality and coverage of existing datasets.\nThe Mobility Australia project received investment (https://doi.org/10.47486/DP702) from the Australian Research Data Commons (ARDC). The ARDC is funded by the National Collaborative Research Infrastructure Strategy (NCRIS).\nThe original data tables were structured in a matrix-like format. AURIN employed a methodology to merge diverse datasets into a comprehensive one, categorising based on transportation types (e.g., trains, buses, rails, ferries), years (e.g., 2019, 2020, 2021, etc.), and temporal scales (e.g., weekly, monthly, yearly). Subsequently, AURIN spatially enabled the original data by employing the 2021 edition of the Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS). The flow between origin and destination pairs is visually represented using line geometry.",

    "description": "These data sets include Salinity, Carbon, Alkalinity, Oxygen and Nutrients (Silicate, Ammonium, Nitrite/Nitrate, Phosphate) analysed from samples collected as part of the Integrated Marine Observing Systems (IMOS) National Mooring Network - National Reference Station (NRS) field sampling. \nNine Sites are included in the IMOS NRS field sampling stations. Maria Island (TAS), Kangaroo Island (SA), Esperance (WA), Rottnest Island (WA), Ningaloo (WA), Darwin (NT), Yongala (QLD), North Stradbroke Island (QLD) and Port Hacking 100 (NSW). \nSampling at these sites is conducted by several members of IMOS NRS Biogeochemical project. Sampling at the sites began between 29/9/2008 and 8/11/2010 and is currently ongoing for 7 sites. Sampling ceased at Ningaloo and Esperance (WA) sites in Aug/Sept 2013.\nSampling is conducted monthly (Esperance and Ningaloo were 3 monthly) from small vessels. Depths sampled range from surface to 105 metres depending on the site. Depths are usually sampled at 10 metre intervals. Details including information on station locations, depths sampled and sample types collected are shown in the PDF link below extracted from the IMOS NRS NATIONAL REFERENCE STATIONS BIOGEOCHEMICAL OPERATIONS - A PRACTICAL HANDBOOK, Version 2.2 July 2012. A link to the full handbook is also provided which includes full details of the sampling regime and analyses.\nHistorical data collected as part of CSIRO Coastal Monitoring program is available for three of the National Reference Station sites:\nMaria Island Coastal Station Data 1944-2008, Port Hacking 100m Coastal Station Data 1953-2010 and Rottnest Island Coastal Station Data 1951-2009.\nThe links to the metadata and access for these data is provided below.\nData storage and access is planned to be interoperable with other national and international programs through the IMOS Infrastructure. Station metadata can be found through this resource. Data is available freely via the AODN portal: https://portal.aodn.org.au.",

    "description": "The 2019-20 Budget is officially available at budget.gov.au as the authoritative source of Budget Papers (BPs) and Portfolio Budget Statement (PBS) documents. This dataset is a collection of data sources from the 2019-20 Budget, including:\r\n\r\n* PBS Excel spreadsheets (including Table 2.X.1 Budgeted Expenses for OutcomeX in machine readable format) – available after PBSs are tabled in the Senate (~8.30pm Budget night); and\r\n* Selected tables from Budget Paper No. 4 (including in machine readable format) – available after the BPs are published on budget.gov.au (~7.30 pm Budget night).\r\n\r\nThe data has been provided to assist those who wish to analyse and visualise key elements of the 2019-20 Budget.\r\n\r\nData users should refer to footnotes and memoranda in the original files as these are not usually captured in machine readable CSVs.\r\n\r\nWe welcome your feedback and comments below.\r\n\r\nThis dataset was prepared by the Department of Finance.\r\n\r\n__Information about the PBS Excel files and CSV:__\r\nThe PBS Excel files published should include the following financial tables with headings and footnotes, which are also are available in CSV. Much of the other data is also available in Budget Papers Nos. 1 and 4 in aggregate form:\r\n\r\n* Table 1.1: Entity Resource Statement;\r\n* Table 1.2: Entity 2018-19 Budget Measures;\r\n* Table 2.X.1: Budgeted Expenses for Outcome X;\r\n* Table 2.X.2: Program Component Expenses;\r\n* Table 3.1 to 3.6: Departmental Budgeted Financial Statements; and\r\n* Tables 3.7 to 3.11: Administered Budgeted Financial Statements.\r\n\r\nPlease note, total expenses reported in the CSV file ‘2019-20 PBS line items dataset’ were prepared from individual entity program expense tables. Totalling these figures does not produce the total expense figure in ‘Table1: Estimates of General Government Expenses’ (Statement 6, Budget Paper 1).

This complements local counts undertaken by the Newcastle Cycleways Movement. The count is conducted by volunteers who record bike rider movements on a count sheet.",

    "description": "The workshop on 'Coastal Management in Northern Australia' was organised by the N.T. Branch of the Australian Marine Sciences Association and the North Australia Research Unit of The Australian National University. The workshop was held in conjunction with the 'Conference on Coasts and Tidal Wetlands of the Australian Monsoon Region', at the Museum of Arts and Science, Conacher Street, Bullocky Point, Darwin, NT between 4-11th November 1984. This record links to the proceedings of the workshop currently archived in the ANU institutional repository, Demetrius.\n*****\nCoastal zone management is primarily about conservation of resources. As an objective, conservation must be viewed not only as a way of retaining what we have but also for creating what we want. In the Northern Territory, coastal environments are for the most part still unspoilt and very often near to original, except in localised areas. There is, therefore, an opportunity not existing elsewhere in the tropical world, to assess what we wish to plan towards and to establish the infrastructure by which such plans can be achieved.",

    "description": "The atomic interstellar medium shows tiny-scale optical depth fluctuations on the scale of 0.1~10,000 AU, whose origin and nature are poorly understood. The existence of this Tiny-Scale Atomic Structure (TSAS) has significant implications, potentially calling into question our fundamental understanding of heating, cooling and dynamical processes in the interstellar medium. Yet observations remain sparse. This long-term project plans to search for temporal variations in HI absorption spectra seen against background pulsars to characterise TSAS in the Milky Way interstellar medium (ISM). These observations constitute the largest number of sightlines and densest temporal sampling ever performed in a single experiment, and will test predictions that TSAS is the tail end of a turbulent cascade, constrain its minimum size scale (down to resolutions of ~0.05 AU) and potentially provide the first direct measurements of pressures in \"large\" TSAS features of &gt; 1000 AU. We make use of the phase-resolved spectral line mode that we have recently implemented on Parkes, which has cut data rates and processing times by factors of ~1000 compared to past studies. This is an expansion of our pilot P1321 to a long term study.",

    "description": "\nThe focus of this dataset is the Australian Capital Territory (ACT). It contains digital spatial data developed to assist in land management decision making in the ACT. The dataset contains hazard ratings for land salinity, stream salt load and stream EC as well as overall salinity hazard for each HGL unit. Information about landscape functions and appropriate salinity management strategies are also listed. Hyperlinks to full management descriptions for each HGL unit are provided. The Hydrogeological Landscape (HGL) concept provides a structure for understanding how differences in salinity are expressed across the landscape. A HGL spatially differentiates areas with similar salt stores and pathways for salt mobilisation. The process of delineating a HGL relies on the integration of a number of causative factors: geology, soils, slope, regolith thickness, and climate; an understanding of the different modes of salinity development; and the impacts of salinity within landscapes (land salinity, salt load and salt concentration in streams due to salt contributions from base flow and runoff ). Information sources such as soil landscape maps, site characterisation, salinity occurrence maps, hydrogeological data, surface water and groundwater data are incorporated into standardised unit descriptions.\nFit for purpose: This dataset was captured at 1:25,000 scale. This dataset is fit for use as a tool for assessing land management issues at the paddock-scale in the ACT, but this does not negate the need for site assessment at a scale suitable to any potential land use or development under consideration.  The mapping was mapped in 'GDA1994 MGA Zone 55s' and transformed to GDA2020 MGA Zone 55s.\nCredits: Rob Muller (NSW OEH), Wayne Cook (NSW OEH), Allan Nicholson (NSW DPI), Alie Cowood (UC)\nDisclaimer: While all care is taken to ensure accuracy, the ACT Government does not warrant that the map is free from error.",

    "description": "The City of Melbourne has installed in-ground parking bay sensors in most CBD parking bays. These sensors record when a vehicle arrives and when it departs. Each record also includes the parking restriction for the bay and whether the vehicle has overstayed that restriction. This is the data for the 2011 calendar year\n\n\n\nKnown data issues: \n\n\n\n1.There are 488,167 records that have the text ‘OLD’ at the end of the restriction in the field named ‘Sign’. This has been investigated and determined the text refers to one of two things, either: \n\n\n\n· At the time of the parking event the restriction that has been captured is correct but when the data was extracted from the server (July 2017) the restriction had since changed. \n\n\n\n· (Or) The particular sensor has since been replaced. \n\n\n\n2. There are a number of records that have a negative value in the duration in field ‘seconds’. This occurs due to a sensor detecting an arrival time being after the departure time. \n\n\n\n3. There are a number of records where the arrival and departure times have not been recorded. If the time has not been recorded the time is calculated from midnight of the arrival day to either midnight of the departure day or to the departure time.\n\nDownload:\n\n<a href=\"https://opendatasoft-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/downloads/archive/vkxi-k7ps.zip\">Download</a> compressed CSV (592.8MB, 21.8 million rows)",

    "description": "Summary of species occurrence data from 1900 to the present for Australian terrestrial species organised by IBRA region and CAPAD protection status. Counts are provided by species and IBRA region for:  \n\nThe number of records showing evidence of the species’ presence inside the region\nThe number of records showing evidence of the species’ presence within CAPAD 2020 protected areas inside the region\nThe number of records showing evidence of the species’ presence within the protected areas under indigenous management within the region  \n\nThe first count includes all records in the second count and the second count includes all records in the third count.\nThe counts in this dataset allow for some simple comparisons between the numbers of species recorded inside and outside protected areas in each region and comparison of the species in each region. Inclusion of EPBC statuses allows comparisons based on conservation status. Note however that such counts may not accurately reflect real differences in biodiversity. It is important to consider confounding factors (particularly variations in recording effort over time).  \nOccurrence records were aggregated and organised by the Atlas of Living Australia (ALA, https://ala.org.au/) and include survey and monitoring data collected and managed by the Integrated Marine Observing System (IMOS, https://imos.org.au/) and the Terrestrial Ecosystem Research Network (TERN, https://tern.org.au/).  \nTo find out more about this dataset, visit: https://ecoassets.org.au/data/summary-data-protection-status-for-australian-terrestrial-species-occurrences/\nDOI: https://doi.org/10.26197/ala.445c74bb-89f2-415e-9e5b-0e38e9c7ee1e",

Orthophotos combine the image characteristics of a photograph with the geometric qualities of a map and can be used as a backdrop layer in conjunction with other spatial information.\n\n\nSpatial Resolution - 6 cm\nSpatial Accuracy - 3 pixels @ 68% confidence (Sigma 1)\nSpatial Accuracy Notes - RMSE values of 0.085m in X and 0.050m in Y to existing control\nMap Projection - Web Mercator Auxiliary Sphere\nRectification Surface - Childers_5m_Ortho_DTM.img. The DNRME DEM for Childers was used without any edits. No alterations were made.\nDescription of Rectification - Rectification processes are via Visionmap Lightspeed\nTile Size / Grid - SW_123000_4567000_1km SW - Refers to the south-west coordinate of the tile (bottom left); 123000 - Coordinate easting of south-west tile corner; 4567000 - Coordinate northing of south-west tile corner\n\n<b>Limitations of Data</b>\nThis dataset contains imagery which has been aero-triangulated, spatially adjusted and rectified using a digital ground surface model. The stated spatial accuracy of this product is relevant for features present at ground level only. Elevated structures (roof-tops, tree canopies, etc) will be affected by relief displacement and cannot be reliably measured from this product. Spatial accuracy is reduced in areas of dense vegetation. ",

    "description": "A 2m by 2m canopy height model (CHM) grid developed from the 2011 aerial LiDAR survey of Christmas Island. As with the 2011 DEM, the CHM was provided to Geoscience Australia in 1km by 1km ESRI grid tiles, which were then joined together using ESRI ArcMap.\nEach grid cell (2m x 2m) contains the maximum vegetation height in metres.  Canopy height was generated by subtracting the ground height from the first laser return classified as vegetation.  As a guide, the data is vertically accurate to 15cm and horizontally accurate to 30cm.  For a detailed description of the survey accuracy see the AAM Survey Report.  The CHM grid file was provided in GDA94 MGA zone 48 and has been left in this projection.\nThe CHM data can be used to find the average vegetation canopy height for defined areas. LiDAR vegetation heights, along with vegetation density values have been used in other organisations to create vegetation maps, estimate carbon content, characterise species habitats and assist in decision making.\nDisclaimer",

This specific dataset presents statistics on affordable 4 bedroom rental properties by the 2016 Local Government Areas geographic level.\nAffordable rental properties are those within 30 per cent of gross income for low-income households. The rental thresholds are taken from the household incomes for whom that number of bedrooms is a minimum: \n\n\nFor one-bedroom properties, we have taken the income of singles on Newstart allowance;\n\n\nFor two-bedroom properties, we have taken a single parent pensioner with one child aged under 5;\n\n\nFor three-bedroom properties, we have taken a couple on Newstart with two children;\n\n\nFor four-bedroom properties, we have taken a couple on Newstart with four children.\n\n\nThe Rental Report provides the most accurate information on the private rental market in Victoria. The data come from records kept by the Residential Tenancies Bond Authority (RTBA). The RTBA is responsible for receiving, registering and refunding all bonds associated with private residential leases in Victoria.\nFor more information please visit the Department of Health and Human Services.",

Other issues, such as stormwater drainage and environmental and ecological considerations are not addressed. \n\nThis dataset contains the location of cross sections lines, indicating modelled / surveyed cross sections of the river channel and floodplain. \n\nThe cross sections are labelled using chainage, which is generally defined as the distance from the downstream start of a flood study traversing up the river. The cross sections are defined perpendicular to the flow direction and illustrate how the relevant flood levels are to be applied across the floodplain. \n\nEach cross section has an associated flood level listed in the attribute fields as follows:\n\nFLDLVL_10 (1 in 10 (10%) AEP flood event)\nFLDLVL_20 (1 in 20 (5%) AEP flood event)\nFLDLVL_25 (1 in 25 (4%) AEP flood event)\nFLDLVL_50 (1 in 50 (2%) AEP flood event)\nFLDLVL_100 (1 in 100 (1%) AEP flood event)\nFLDLVL_DFE (Designated flood event)\nFLDLVL_200 (1 in 200 (0.5%) AEP flood event)\nFLDLVL_500 (1 in 500 (0.2%) AEP flood event) \nFLDLVL_MCC (Maximum channel capacity)\nFLDLVL_PMF (Probable maximum flood event)\n\nNote: To see the full scope of the floodplain mapping, 12 dataset layers are required to be loaded in the following order:\n\nFLOODPLAIN DATASET LAYERS:    \nFPM Flood Level Points (m AHD)\nFPM Flood Level Contours (m AHD)\nFPM 1 in 100 (1%) AEP Floodway and Flood Fringe Line\nFPM Extent of Flooding\nFPM Levee Banks\nFPM Location of Cross Sections\nFPM 1 in 100 (1%) AEP Floodplain Development Control Area\nFPM Map Index\nFPM Bridges\nFPM Special Development Condition Area\nFPM 1 in 100 (1%) AEP Floodway and Flood Fringe Area\nFPM Floodplain Area\n\nThe dataset covers the following areas:\n<ul>\n<li>\n\nAvon River - Toodyay to Beverley.\n</li>\n<li>\n\nCapel River - Capel Townsite.\n</li>\n<li>\n\nChapman River – Geraldton Townsite.\n</li>\n<li>\n\nCoblinine River &amp; Dorderyemunning Creek - Wagin Townsite.\n</li>\n<li>\n\nCollie River - Collie Townsite.\n</li>\n<li>\n\nCorrigin Townsite.\n</li>\n<li>\n\nDenmark River – Denmark Townsite.\n</li>\n<li>\n\nFive Mile Brook - Bunbury Townsite.\n</li>\n<li>\n\nFitzroy River - Fitzroy Crossing.\n</li>\n<li>\n\nGreenough River – Indian Ocean to Walkaway.\n</li>\n<li>\n\nGribble Creek - Kalgoorlie Townsite.\n</li>\n<li>\n\nHarding River – Roebourne Townsite.\n</li>\n<li>\n\nIrwin River - Dongara Townsite.\n</li>\n<li>\n\nMargaret River – Margaret River Townsite.\n</li>\n<li>\n\nMurray River - Ravenswood Bridge to Blythewood.\n</li>\n<li>\n\nNullagine River – Nullagine Townsite.\n</li>\n<li>\n\nPreston River - Boyanup and Donnybrook Townsites.\n</li>\n<li>\n\nSwan River, Canning River and Tributaries: Fremantle to Walyunga National Park (Swan River) and Canning Bridge to Brookton Highway (Canning River). Tributaries include Bennett Brook, Blackadder Creek, Ellen Brook, Helena River, Jane Brook, St Leonards Creek, Susannah Brook (Swan River) and Southern River/ Wungong Brook (Canning River).\n</li>\n<li>\n\nToby Inlet – Quindalup Townsite.\n</li>\n<li>\n\nTurkey Creek – Warmun Aboriginal Community.\n</li>\n<li>\n\nYakamia Creek – Albany Townsite.\n</li>\n</ul>\n\nGlossary:\n<ul>\n<li>\n\nAnnual exceedance probability (AEP) - the likelihood of occurrence of a flood of a given size or larger in any one year; usually expressed as a percentage.\n</li>\n<li>\n\n1 in 100 AEP flood - this means that there is a 1 in 100 (or 1%) chance of a flow of this size or larger occurring in any one year. This flood has a 50% chance of being experienced at least once in a person's lifetime. The 1 in 100 AEP flood has been generally adopted in Australia and overseas as the basis for floodplain management planning.\n</li>\n<li>\n\nFloodplain - the portion of a river valley next to the river channel which is covered with water when the river overflows its banks during major river flows. The term also applies to land adjacent to estuaries which is subject to flooding.\n</li>\n<li>\n\nDesignated flood event (DFE) - used for planning purposes and is generally the 1 in 100 (1%) AEP \"designed\" flood event. However, a designated flood event could be based on an \"actual\" flood event (e.g. Moora 1999 flood event) or an alternative scenario (i.e. Yakamia Creek - 1 in 100 (1%) AEP flood event plus sea level rise).\n</li>\n<li>\n\nMaximum channel capacity (MCC) - the maximum flow that a waterway can contain before breaking out across the floodplain during a flood event. \n</li>\n<li>\n\nProbable maximum flood (PMF) - the largest flood that could conceivably occur at a particular location, resulting from probable maximum precipitation. The PMF defines the extent of flood-prone land. Generally, it is not physically or financially possible to provide general protection against this event.\n</li>\n<li>\n\nAustralian Height Datum (AHD) - is a geodetic datum for altitude measurement in Australia. It was adopted in 1971 by the National Mapping Council as the datum to which all vertical control for mapping is to be referred. The datum is based on the mean sea level (1966-1968) being assigned the value 0.000m on the Australian Height Datum (AHD) at 30 tide gauges around the coast of the Australian continent.\n</li>\n</ul>\n\nThis dataset was formerly known as FPM Location of Cross Sections (DOW-035)",

    "description": "This dataset presents the footprint of the percentage of tobacco use, alcohol risk and recent illicit drug use for people aged 14 years and over. The data spans the year of 2016 and is aggregated to 2015 Department of Health Primary Health Network (PHN) areas, based on the 2011 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nThe data is sourced from the 2016 National Drug Strategy Household Survey (NDSHS). The NDSHS is the leading survey of licit and illicit drug use in Australia. The 2016 survey was the 12th conducted under the auspices of the NDS. Previous surveys were conducted in 1985, 1988, 1991, 1993, 1995, 1998, 2001, 2004, 2007, 2010 and 2013. The data collected through these surveys have contributed to the development of policies for Australia's response to drug-related issues.\nThe NDSHS data accompanies the National Drug Strategy Household Survey 2016: Detailed Findings Report.\nFor further information about this dataset, please visit: \n\n\nAustralian Institute of Health and Welfare - National Drug Strategy Household Survey 2016 Data Tables.\n\n\nNational Drug Strategy Household Survey 2016 - Data Quality Statement.\n\n\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data using the Department of Health - PHN Areas.\n\n\nThe calculation of alcohol risk was updated in 2013. 'Abstainers' no longer equate to 'never' and 'ex-drinkers' combined because the calculation now excludes drinkers who did not indicate the quantity of alcohol they consumed. Trend data will not match the data presented in previous reports. Refer to technical notes for further details.\n\n\nRecent illicit drug use is defined as illicit drug use in the previous 12 months.\n\n\nResults for Western Queensland should be interpreted with caution, as all respondents came from the same smaller geographical area within the PHN and the results may not be representative of the whole PHN.\n\n",

    "description": "Raster layer delineates the level of uncertainty depending on the data age, origin, scale and spatial mix; scaled to 0-1. \nGeneral Background: The National Vegetation Information System (NVIS) has been developed over the last 15 years from a variety of data sources. The commonwealth is reliant on states and territories to supply vegetation data, which is then collated into the NVIS. Because of varying levels of resources available to different regions, the data they are able to supply is of varying scale, age, origin and spatial mix. \nNVIS is widely used by various organisation including, researchers, NGO and governments, for a wide range of uses such as modelling, fire fuel loads and policy. To improve the interpretation of the NVIS dataset the Dept of the Environment & Energy has developed a suite of uncertainty layers and tools to facilitate the robust use of the NVIS.\nAim: to develop a raster Uncertainty layer that is intended to better describe the input datasets and assist in dynamic analyses of data quality and gaps in the NVIS extant theme dataset.\nOutput: raster files scaled 0-1 that can be used for uncertainty, including data age, origin, scale and spatial mix. The layers can be added together to form one uncertainty layer. Python script/tools will also be provided so individuals can develop their own uncertainty layers and to be as transparent as possible.\nThe Uncertainty layers comprise 5 rasters, 1 composite and 5 individual layers:\n                 -      NVIS Uncertainty layer (composite of 4 below layers)\n                 -      Age: age of the NVIS data\n                 -      Origin: where the data came from\n                 -      Spatial mix: if the data is a mosaic\n                 -      Scale: scale that the data was mapped\nAge, scale, origin and spatial mix Information is supplied by the states and territories as part of the NVIS resupply process.CC - Attribution (CC BY)\nThis data has been licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Australia Licence.

    "description": "## **Abstract** \n\nThis dataset and its metadata statement were supplied to the Bioregional Assessment Programme by a third party and are presented here as originally supplied. \n\n\n\nThis dataset is a GIS layer of Victorian groundwater-surface water interaction data clipped to the Gippsland region.  \n\n\n\nGroundwater generally interacts with surface water through various processes and pathways. The development of ground water often has impacts on surface streams and visa versa. The data results from an assessment of the SW-GW interaction across the study area.  The data describes GW and SW interaction in four broad classes : neutral/losing, gaining, variable and unclassified.  The Australian Hydrological Geospatial Fabric Surface Hydrology Catchments dataset was used as the base layer for considering surface water as an asset. This dataset provided mapped major rivers for Victoria.  Numerous investigations into the interaction between groundwater and surface water have occurred across Victoria. Where this information was available in a format suitable for use in a GIS, it was collated to inform a state wide dataset of groundwater and surface water interaction. The resulting product attributes the stream base layer (described above) with the following classification of groundwater and surface water interaction:   Gaining//Variable//Neutral/Losing//Unclassified\n\n## **Dataset History** \n\nGIS data based on DSE, 2012. Victorian groundwater-surface water interaction spatial data. Compiled for the Secure Allocation, Future Entitlements (SAFE) Project by the Department of Sustainability and Environment, Victoria.\n\n\n\nThe method used to generate the dataset of groundwater and surface water interaction in Victoria can be summarised as: (1) Where a hydrogeochemistry study by Monash University was available to provide an indication of groundwater and surface water interaction it was adopted with high reliability; (2) Where a Murray-Darling Basin sustainable yields groundwater and surface water interaction study was available, it was adopted with medium reliability; (3) Where Melbourne Water Corporation (MWC) had indicated river reaches characterised by remnant pools of water in prolonged drought, this was considered to be indicative of gaining river conditions, with medium reliability; (4) Where a baseflow indices study was available, it was indicative of a gaining river reach and assigned medium reliability; (5) Where no other information existed and the river was classified as \"unmodified\", it was assumed to be gaining if it was perennial and neutral/losing if it was not perennial. These river reaches were assigned a low reliability; (6) Where no other information existed and the river was classified as \"modified\", an indication of groundwater-surface water interaction could not occur, given that the modification of flows could be responsible for the perenniality of the river reach, as opposed to being indicative of losing or gaining groundwater; (7) A reliability dataset was also generated that indicates the assumed reliability of the classification, which was directly correlated to the reliability of the input data.\n\n## **Dataset Citation** \n\nBioregional Assessment Programme (XXXX) Gippsland region clip of Victorian groundwater-surface water interaction. Bioregional Assessment Derived Dataset. Viewed 05 October 2018, http://data.bioregionalassessments.gov.au/dataset/e889b765-9822-4d0a-aef6-99071b0ec7ad.\n\n## **Dataset Ancestors** \n\n* **Derived From** [Groundwater and Surface Water Interaction Victoria](https://data.gov.au/data/dataset/07a9df56-5108-4ec7-8c28-3a684248d7db)\n\n",

    "description": "An assessment of progress is made by examining data from 2008 (or closest to) until the latest available data at the time of reporting, in 2019. The baseline year is 2008 as this was the year in which the National Indigenous Reform Agreement was established. The Report uses most recent available data and limitations are indicated where appropriate in the Report. Some data sets have different sampling approaches and time-series, particularly in the use of comparison data for non-Aboriginal people (or whole-of-population). In some instances, comparable non-Aboriginal or Victoria-wide data is not available to support group comparisons. \nIn these instances, proxy data is used. For example, ABS data from Aboriginal-specific surveys such as the National Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Health and Social Surveys are used to inform some indicators. The most comparable equivalent data for non-Aboriginal Victorians is the Victorian Population Health Survey which has a different sampling approach and time series. This approach, while liable to sampling bias, has been used by Victorian population health researchers and is methodologically sound. Aboriginal data has unique challenges. Small population sizes mean that there is a diminished ability to detect trends and changes for a given outcome (minimum detectable effect), and a greater degree of data volatility leading to large fluctuations between time points. This means there is a higher threshold for determining improvement at a statistically significant level compared to general population data. The Report identifies where trends are suggestive of improvement or deterioration but are compromised by data volatility or small numbers. ",

    "description": "_This dataset is updated weekly. Please ensure that you use the most up-to-date version._\r\n\r\n##Background\r\nThe Australian Charities and Not-for-profits Commission (ACNC) is Australia’s national regulator of charities.\r\nSince 3 December 2012, charities wanting to access Commonwealth charity tax concessions (and other benefits) need to register with the ACNC. Although many charities choose to register, registration with the ACNC is voluntary.\r\n\r\nEach year, registered charities are required to lodge an Annual Information Statement (AIS) with the ACNC. Charities are required to submit their AIS within six months of the end of their reporting period.\r\n\r\nThe AIS collects information about a charity’s programs, HR and financial information.\r\n\r\n##2022 AIS data\r\nThis dataset can be used to find 2022 AIS information lodged by multiple charities.\r\n\r\nIt can also be used to filter and sort by different variables across all AIS information. AIS Information for individual charities can be viewed via the [ACNC Charity Register](https://www.acnc.gov.au/charity/).\r\n\r\nOur explanatory notes (see below) detail the information collected in the AIS and the data outputs you can expect.\r\n\r\nThe ACNC has also published a report analysing 2022 AIS data. This report - the 9th edition of the Charities Report - can be found on our website.\r\n\r\n##Interpreting AIS data\r\nWhen comparing charities’ financial information it is important to consider each charity's unique situation. This is particularly true for small charities, which are not compelled to provide financial reports – reports that often contain more details about their financial position and activities – as part of their AIS. For more information on interpreting financial information, please refer to the [ACNC website](https://www.acnc.gov.au/charity/about-acnc-charity-register/information-charity-register).\r\n\r\n##Withheld information\r\nRegistered charities can apply to the ACNC to have some or all of the information they provide withheld from the ACNC Register. However, there are only limited circumstances when the ACNC can agree to withhold information. If a charity has applied to have their data withheld, the AIS data relating to that charity has been excluded from this dataset.\r\n\r\nNOTE: It is possible that some information in this dataset might be subject to a future request from a charity to have their information withheld. If this occurs, this information will still appear in the dataset until the next update. Please consider this risk when using this dataset.\r\n\r\n##More ACNC data\r\nThe ACNC also publishes other datasets on [data.gov.au](https://data.gov.au/organisations/org-dga-4d907503-b2aa-4c38-ac13-1273e791cb08) as part of our commitment to open data and transparent regulation.",

    "description": "This dataset presents the footprint of the number of installations of small generation unit (SGU) solar panel systems and their rated output in kilowatts (kW). The data spans the months of 2002 and includes the total for the year. The data is aggregated to Postal Areas (POAs) from the 2016 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nEvery month the Clean Energy Regulator (CER) publishes small-scale renewable energy installation data files. These data files provide a list of SGU (small-scale solar panel, wind and hydro systems) and kW capacity by installed postcode, and solar water heaters (SWH) and air source heat pumps by installed postcode. The data represents all systems that have had certificates validly created against them. The data includes new installations, upgrades to existing systems and stand-alone (off-grid) systems. This data is not publicly available via the Renewable Energy Certificate (REC) Registry and does not include systems that are pending registration or have been failed by the CER.\nFor further information about this dataset, visit the data source:Clean Energy Regulator - Postcode Data for Small-scale Installations.\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data by joining the data with the 2016 ASGS POAs\n\n\nThe data is current as at 30-09-2018.\n\n\nRenewable Energy Target (RET) legislation allows a 12 month creation period for registered persons to create their certificates.\n\n\nSmall-scale technology certificates are calculated based on the life of the system. This differs for solar hot water heaters and small generation units (solar panels, wind and hydro). Further information can be found at theRenewable Energy Target FAQ.\n\n\nCapacity data has been revised to account for past data entry errors which caused significant inconsistencies. These systems were installed between 2001 and 2003. As a result of this revision, the cumulative installed capacity from 2004 onwards has reduced by 5.517MW.\n\n",

Each record also includes the parking restriction for the bay and whether the vehicle has overstayed that restriction. This is the data for the 2013 calendar year\n\n\n\nKnown data issues: \n\n\n\n1. There are 987,179 records that have the text ‘OLD’ at the end of the restriction in the field named ‘Sign’. This has been investigated and determined the text refers to one of two things, either: \n\n\n\n· At the time of the parking event the restriction that has been captured is correct but when the data was extracted from the server (July 2017) the restriction had since changed. \n\n\n\n· (Or) The particular sensor has since been replaced. \n\n\n\n2. There are a number of records that have a negative value in the duration in field ‘seconds’. This occurs due to a sensor detecting an arrival time being after the departure time. \n\n\n\n3. There are a number of records where the arrival and departure times have not been recorded. If the time has not been recorded the time is calculated from midnight of the arrival day to either midnight of the departure day or to the departure time.\nDownload:\nDownload compressed CSV (1.24GB, 43.2 million rows)",

    "description": "This dataset presents the footprint of the percentage of patients with specialist and obstetric costs, and out-of-pocket cost per specialist and obstetric attendance at the 25th, 50th, 75th and 90th percentile. The data spans the financial year of 2016-2017 and is aggregated to Statistical Area Level 3 (SA3) from the 2016 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nThe data is sourced from the Medicare Benefits Schedule (MBS) claims data, which are administered by the Australian Government Department of Health. The claims data are derived from administrative information on services that qualify for a Medicare benefit under the Health Insurance Act 1973 and for which a claim has been processed by the Department of Human Services. Data are reported for claims processed between 1 July 2016 and 30 June 2017. The data also contains the results from the ABS 2016-17 Patient Experience Survey, collected between 1 July 2016 and 30 June 2017. The Patient Experience Survey is conducted annually by the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) and collects information from a representative sample of the Australian population. The Patient Experience Survey is one of several components of the Multipurpose Household Survey, as a supplement to the monthly Labour Force Survey.\nThe Patients' spending on Medicare Services data accompanies the Patients' out-of-pocket spending on Medicare services 2016-17 Report.\nFor further information about this dataset, visit the data source:Australian Institute of Health and Welfare - Patients' out-of-pocket spending on Medicare services Data Tables.\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data.\n\n\nSpecialist attendances are Medicare-subsidised referred patient/doctor encounters, such as visits, consultations, and attendances by video conference, involving medical practitioners who have been recognised as specialists or consultant physicians for Medicare benefits purposes.\n\n\nObstetric attendances are Medicare-subsidised antenatal visits and attendances for the planning and management of pregnancy, as well as obstetric procedures involving non-admitted patients. These services can be provided by an obstetrician or GP. Selected services can also be provided by a midwife, nurse or Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander health practitioner when the service is provided on behalf of, and under the supervision of, a medical practitioner.\n\n\nOut-of-pocket cost per service is the net cost to the patient of a health service, after deducting the Medicare benefit paid. The measure is calculated per patient (patients' annual out-of-pocket cost for eligible attendances, divided by the number of eligible attendances that the patient claimed in the year), for patients with out-of-pocket costs.\n\n\nThe data is based on the patient's Medicare enrolment postcode, not where they received the health care service. Most peoples' Medicare enrolment postcode will be their residential postcode.\n\n\nIf a service was flagged as bulk-billed, then the fee charged was set to equal the benefit paid (so there was no out-of-pocket cost for that service).\n\n\nPatients were excluded if the sum of eligible services in the year was less than one, or if their annual out-of-pocket expenditure on the eligible services was equal to or less than zero.\n\n\nIncludes non-hospital Medicare-subsidised services only.\n\n\nNP - Not available for publication. The estimate is considered to be unreliable. Values assigned to NP in the original data have been set to null.\n\n",

    "description": "AUSRIVAS (Australian River Assessment System) is a river condition monitoring program that uses the environmental sensitivity of aquatic macroinvertebrates to assess the condition of waterways. AUSRIVAS predicts the macroinvertebrate fauna expected to occur at a site with specific environmental characteristics, in the absence of environmental stress. The fauna observed (O) at a site can then be compared to fauna expected (E), with the deviation between the two providing an indication of biological condition. A site displaying no biological impairment should have an O/E taxa score close to one. The O/E taxa score will decrease as the macroinvertebrate assemblage and richness are adversely affected.\nACT Government maintains 13 AUSRIVAS monitoring locations across the ACT. Sampling is undertaken twice per year (spring and autumn). Site details are provided in another dataset. The O/E taxa score (Score) is provided in this dataset, along with the siteID, Site Name, Season in which the survey was undertaken, and the Year in which the survey was undertaken.",

    "description": "The Views of ABC News Digital Content dataset provides both the number of page/screen views per hour for individual pieces of ABC News content and metadata related to each piece of content.  The data is taken from across different ABC digital platforms during the month of May 2016.  These platforms include the ABC News desktop and mobile websites and the ABC app (both iOS and Android versions).\r\nEach piece of content is represented by its ID and is consistent for the same piece of content across platforms.  The URL of the content can be recreated using the platform and this ID.  For example, for the “News” platform and id “7373616”, the URL is retrieved using “http://www.abc.net.au/news/7373616”. The content ID is the key which joins the Traffic data with the Content Metadata.\r\nThe data set covers the period from 2016-05-01 00:00:00 to 2016-05-31 23:59:59.\r\n\r\n#Rights information\r\nThis data includes metadata about existing publicly available stories. In general terms, developers are free to use this data to explore ABC's content. But original stories and images should always be linked to. Stories and photos should not be reproduced in whole on another service. __ The stories themselves and their associated media items still remain the property of ABC and other rights holders where noted.__  Full details of copyright and more are listed on abc.net.au: http://www.abc.net.au/conditions.htm\r\n\r\n",

    "description": "This dataset contains historical environmental readings from microclimate sensors located across the city. The data was updated every hour in fifteen minute increments and can be used to determine variations in microclimate changes throughout the day. Microclimate data includes:\n- Ambient air temperature\n- Relative humidity\n- Barometric pressure\n- Particulate matter 2.5\n- Particulate matter 10\n- Average wind speed\n\nThe Microclimate Sensor Readings helps us to understand temperature, relative humidity, pressure, particulate matter 2.5, particulate matter 10, and average wind speed at different locations and different times of day to better inform decision-making and plan for the future.\n\nAdditional values are included in this dataset to provide an easier way to correlate the data with the official EPA Victoria data. These can be identified with the value 'epa' included in the type column. EPA Victoria report air quality readings in 1 hour and 24 hour averages. This includes; ambient air temperature readings in 1 hour average, relative humidity readings in 1 hour average, particulate matter 2.5 readings in 1 hour and 24 hour averages, and particulate matter 10 readings in 1 hour and 24 hour averages.\n\nThe site_id column can be used to merge the data with the <a href=\"https://melbournetestbed.opendatasoft.com/explore/dataset/microclimate-sensor-locations/information/\">Sensor Locations dataset</a> which contains the sensor location. Any changes to sensor locations are important to consider when analysing and interpreting historical microclimate data.\n\nNote this dataset may not contain a reading for every sensor for every 15 minutes as the sensor devices might not have a reading for each value. There may be situations where no readings are reported for all sensors or only some readings are reported at a particular site.\n\nFor the description of each sensor please see the <a href=\"/api/datasets/1.0/microclimate-sensor-readings/attachments/microclimatesensors_metadata_attachment_datadictionary_1_pdf/\">sensor type document</a>.\n\nRelated datasets: \n\n<a href=\"https://melbournetestbed.opendatasoft.com/explore/dataset/microclimate-sensor-locations/information/\">Microclimate Sensors - Sensor Locations</a>",

Each record also includes the parking restriction for the bay and whether the vehicle has overstayed that restriction.

This has been investigated and determined the text refers to one of two things, either: \n\n\n\n· At the time of the parking event the restriction that has been captured is correct but when the data was extracted from the server (July 2017) the restriction had since changed. \n\n\n\n· (Or) The particular sensor has since been replaced. \n\n\n\n2. There are a number of records that have a negative value in the duration in field ‘seconds’. This occurs due to a sensor detecting an arrival time being after the departure time. \n\n\n\n3. There are a number of records where the arrival and departure times have not been recorded. If the time has not been recorded the time is calculated from midnight of the arrival day to either midnight of the departure day or to the departure time.\nDownload:\nDownload compressed CSV (592.8MB, 21.8 million rows)",

    "description": "The area covered by this investigation, totalling approximately 100 square miles, surrounds an occurrence of radio-active minerals which was discovered in 1950. The deposit is 30 feet east of the Stuart Highway, 21 miles south-east of Pine Creek, Northern Territory, and 40 miles north-west of Katherine. It is one third of a mile north-east of the Fergusson railways siding. Mapping of the area was undertaken consequent upon an examination of the Fergusson River Crossing Deposit by H.J. Ward in September 1950 and by Ward and R.S. Matheson in November 1950. Although the prospect itself was not considered to warrant further work, it was thought that further occurrences might exist in the area, particularly along the shear which had localized the known deposit. Mapping and prospecting of the area was therefore recommended. This report records the results of that investigation.",

    "description": "\nThe focus of this dataset is the Australian Capital Territory (ACT). It contains digital spatial data developed to assist in land management decision making in the ACT. The dataset contains hazard ratings for land salinity, stream salt load and stream EC as well as overall salinity hazard for each HGL unit. Information about landscape functions and appropriate salinity management strategies are also listed. Hyperlinks to full management descriptions for each HGL unit are provided. The Hydrogeological Landscape (HGL) concept provides a structure for understanding how differences in salinity are expressed across the landscape. A HGL spatially differentiates areas with similar salt stores and pathways for salt mobilisation. The process of delineating a HGL relies on the integration of a number of causative factors: geology, soils, slope, regolith thickness, and climate; an understanding of the different modes of salinity development; and the impacts of salinity within landscapes (land salinity, salt load and salt concentration in streams due to salt contributions from base flow and runoff ). Information sources such as soil landscape maps, site characterisation, salinity occurrence maps, hydrogeological data, surface water and groundwater data are incorporated into standardised unit descriptions.\nFit for purpose: This dataset was captured at 1:25,000 scale. This dataset is fit for use as a tool for assessing land management issues at the paddock-scale in the ACT, but this does not negate the need for site assessment at a scale suitable to any potential land use or development under consideration.  The mapping was mapped in 'GDA1994 MGA Zone 55s' and transformed to GDA2020 MGA Zone 55s.\nCredits: Rob Muller (NSW OEH), Wayne Cook (NSW OEH), Allan Nicholson (NSW DPI), Alie Cowood (UC)\nDisclaimer: While all care is taken to ensure accuracy, the ACT Government does not warrant that the map is free from error.",

    "description": "This dataset presents the location of Queensland state schools with student attendance rates for the years 2013-2017. Student attendance rate is generated by dividing the total of full-days and part-days that students attended, and comparing this to the total of all possible days for students to attend, expressed as a percentage.\nFor further information about this dataset, please visit the Queensland Department of Education - Student Attendance.\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled this data using the Queensland Department of Education - State and Non State School Listings 2012-2018.\n\n\nData is made available through a AURIN-QCIF-RIDL collaboration.\n\n\nWhen analysing attendance data over time, it should be noted that extreme events such as cyclones, flooding and pandemics may have impacted on the data in certain years.\n\n\nThe school structure in this cube is as at the publication date. For this reason, schools which were created by amalgamation may have student attendance rates for years prior to opening.\n\n\nThe number of schools in this cube may differ from the school count cube because there are a small number of schools which do not have enrolments of their own, rather students from other schools attend these schools on an as needed basis.\n\n",
