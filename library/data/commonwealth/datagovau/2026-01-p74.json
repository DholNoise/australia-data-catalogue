    "description": "The data set contains airborne pollen concentrations (grains per cubic meter) from samples taken at Campbelltown site, New South Wales, Australia (-34.0721, 150.8056) between July 2016 and June 2020. Each data row has two concentrations: one for grass (Poaceae) and one for all other pollens. For comparison with other data sets and between pollen seasons the data weeks start at July 1 each calendar year. Extra days at the end of the pollen year are included in week 52. Each data row has a collection period start date, the number of days within the collection period (7-9), and the number of days on which pollen was collected and summed (0-9). Concentrations represent only the number of days collected and not always the full collection period, as indicated.  \nAirborne pollen samples were collected using a volumetric continuous flow impaction sampler (Burkard Manufacturing, UK), stained with fuchsin and counted by light microscopy according to best practice described in the Australian Airborne Pollen and Spore Monitoring Network Interim Standard and Protocols (Version 2, 14 September 2018).\nData may be used for modelling and forecasting airborne grass, other, total pollen levels. Other uses include analysis of the effect of pollen levels on asthma and allergy presentations, or in inference of grass and other vegetation growth patterns. Data may also be used for evaluation of medium or long-term trends over time or comparison withpollen exposure levels between spatial distant locations.\nMetadata about this and other AusPollen Aerobiology Collaboration Network monitoring sites is provided on the National Environmental Monitoring Site Register. Information about other pollen and spores monitored can be found by the AusPollen Aerobiology Collaboration Network Species Classification on the ARDC Research Vocabularies site.\nAURIN has added latitude, longitude and spatialised geometry columns for each row based on the coordinates of the pollen samples. Periods over which no data is available are marked as null.",

The source datasets are identified in the Lineage field in this metadata statement. The processes undertaken to produce this derived dataset are described in the History field in this metadata statement. \n\n\n\nVector and raster representation of the ACRD drawdown extents for the 5th, 50th and 95th quantiles for three depth thresholds 0.2m, 2m and 5m. Used for mapping.\n\n## **Dataset History** \n\nACRD drawdown values per Assessment unit were taken from the input csv files and joined to  the input Assessment unit layer. Through series of selections and dissolving (ArcGIS tool DISSOLVE) a series of vector and raster footprint layers were created for the various each combination of quantile and depth threshold. The quantiles being 5 (q05), 50 (q50)and 95 (q95). The threshold depths being 0.2m (gt02), 2m (gt20) and 5m (gt50).\n\n## **Dataset Citation** \n\nBioregional Assessment Programme (XXXX) HUN Quantile footprints v01.

This data has generally been supplied by lead water agencies.\nThe Bureau will continue to work to expand the number of water information categories and water monitoring stations presented. For more information refer to the Water Data Online information sheet\nThe time period over which data is available varies according to how long the stations have been operating. The period of record for some locations starts in the late 19th century. Water Data Online does not display near real time, or flood data. Water Data Online also contains historical data from some stations that are no longer being operated. Such data can provide valuable insight into environmental changes and help build a more comprehensive national picture of our water resources.",

    "description": "The Murray-Darling Basin Plan (available at http://www.comlaw.gov.au/Details/F2012L02240) was developed under the Commonwealth Water Act 2007and aims to deliver a coordinated approach to water use by States and Territories in the Murray-Darling Basin (MDB), underpinned by a commitment to restoring the long-term health of rivers and wetlands in the Basin. To achieve this, the Basin Plan sets a long term average Sustainable Diversion Limit (SDL) for surface water and groundwater use across the major valleys in the MDB, and incorporates an Environmental Watering Plan (EWP) that ensures surplus water beyond SDLs is made available for the natural floodplain and wetland systems. The EWP is central to the Basin Plan as it aims to achieve the best possible environmental outcomes in its use of environmental water, in terms of size, timing and nature of river flows. The EWP is supported by the Environmental Water Recovery Strategy, a voluntary water buyback instrument (SEWPAC 2012).\nThe long term average SDL for surface water flow is currently set by the Basin Plan at 10,873 gigalitres per year (GL/y). This includes 3,468 GL/y for the northern Basin, which establishes a water ‘saving’ of 390 GL/y from water allocations previously set under the Living Murray initiative (MDBA 2011). These savings are available as ‘environmental water’ which is regulated by the Commonwealth Environmental Water Office (CEWO) via the EWP.\nWater allocations in the northern Basin are currently under review via the Northern Basin Review, which is due for finalisation in mid-2016. This review is expected to improve environmental science in relation to floodplain systems in the Condamine-Balonne and Barwon-Darling River systems, and may recommend changes to the Basin Plan accordingly. A key part of the Review is to improve knowledge about environmental assets within river systems of the northern Basin (e.g. floodplain and wetland vegetation, fish, water birds), and how they respond and interact to fluctuations in surface water flow. Improved knowledge about the native vegetation of inland floodplain systems is fundamental to the Northern Basin Review.\nTo improve information about the distribution and extent of floodplain and wetland vegetation types in the northern Basin, Eco Logical Australia (ELA) was commissioned by the Murray Darling Basin Authority (MDBA) to map the distribution of plant community types (PCTs) within a large section of the Darling floodplain west of Louth, and within the Condamine-Balonne system south of the NSW-Queensland border. An improved knowledge about the distribution and extent of floodplain PCTs will inform how environmental water allocations might be refined, and is thus an important component of the Northern Basin Review.\nAttributes:\nPCT_ID = NSW Plant Community Type Code \nPCT_LABEL = Plant Community Type Label \nBROAD_VEG = Broad Vegetation Type\nHYDROL_ECOL = Hydro-Ecological Functional Group\nVEG_FORMAT = Vegetation Formation\nVEG_CLASS = Vegetation Class\nFloodplain = Floodplain vegetation (yes or no)\nMAP_LABEL = Short vegetation label suitable for display on map products\nRE = Regional Ecosystem Code\nRE_LABEL = Regional Ecosystem Label\nACCURACY = Attribute accuracy (values 1 to 5)\n5 - Verified in the field by either full floristic, rapid or API (observational) site \n4 - Not verified in the field but likely to be correct due to extrapolation from similar verified pattern or verified in field but uncertain of boundary\n3 - Probably correct although could be one of a few related communities\n2 - Possibly correct but might be one of several other communities\n1 - Unlikely to be correct\nFor more information please refer to the technical report.

    "description": "This dataset presents information about total income distribution. The data covers the financial year of 2017-2018, and is based on Statistical Area Level 3 (SA3) according to the 2016 edition of the Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nTotal Income is the sum of all reported income derived from Employee income, Own unincorporated business, Superannuation, Investments and Other income. Total income does not include the non-lodger population.\nGovernment pensions, benefits or allowances are excluded from the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) income data and do not appear in Other income or Total income. Pension recipients can fall below the income threshold that necessitates them lodging a tax return, or they may only receive tax free pensions or allowances. Hence they will be missing from the personal income tax data set. Recent estimates from the ABS Survey of Income and Housing (which records Government pensions and allowances) suggest that this component can account for between 9% to 11% of Total income.\nAll monetary values are presented as gross pre-tax dollars, as far as possible. This means they reflect income before deductions and loses, and before any taxation or levies (e.g. the Medicare levy or the temporary budget repair levy) are applied. The amounts shown are nominal, they have not been adjusted for inflation. The income presented in this release has been categorised into income types, these categories have been devised by the ABS to closely align to ABS definitions of income.\nThe statistics in this release are compiled from the Linked Employer Employee Dataset (LEED), a cross-sectional database based on administrative data from the Australian taxation system. The LEED includes more than 120 million tax records over seven consecutive years between 2011-12 and 2017-18.\nPlease note:\n\n\nAll personal income tax statistics included in LEED were provided in de-identified form with no home address or date of birth. Addresses were coded to the ASGS and date of birth was converted to an age at 30 June of the reference year prior to data provision.\n\n\nTo minimise the risk of identifying individuals in aggregate statistics, perturbation has been applied to the statistics in this release. Perturbation involves small random adjustment of the statistics and is considered the most satisfactory technique for avoiding the release of identifiable statistics, while maximising the range of information that can be released. These adjustments have a negligible impact on the underlying pattern of the statistics. Some cells have also been suppressed due to low counts.\n\n\nTotals may not align with the sum of their components due to missing or unpublished information in the underlying data and perturbation.\n\n\nFor further information please visit the Australian Bureau of Statistics.\nAURIN has made the following changes to the original data:\n\n\nSpatially enabled the original data.\n\n\nSet 'np' (not published to protect the confidentiality of individuals or businesses) values to Null.\n\n",

The habitat types depicted in the dataset include rocky reef, sand, hard sand and seagrass. The data was collected from November 2004 to September 2005 by marine researchers at the Tasmanian Aquaculture and Fisheries Institute. The shallow waters of the estuaries enabled the use of aerial photography, including purpose flown aerial surveys, and satellite imagery as the primary data source. The habitats defined in the imagery were ground truthed in the field with underwater camera equipment, echo sounder data, and a Differential GPS unit. The dataset is intended for the use of  fulfilling the coastal management objectives according to The Living Marine Resources Act 1995 and to support Natural Resource management priorities in the Southern NRM region of Tasmania.",

    "description": "Long-term average annual extraction limit (LTAAEL) is a regulatory limit set on annual water extractions from a river system. It ensures that average extractions over the long term are sustainable, and thus help prevent environmental degradation.\n\nIn NSW these limits are defined by water sharing plans (WSPs). Every WSP outlines how the water in a river system will be shared over a 10-year period. They also define:\n\n• how LTAAEL compliance is to be assessed for each river system\n\n• what conditions will trigger noncompliance action\n\n• what compliance action can be taken.\n\nThe Natural Resources Commission regularly reviews all WSPs to ensure extractions from each river system are within the limits set, and the Murray-Darling Basin Authority reviews sustainable diversion limit (SDL) compliance each year.\n\nTo assess compliance, we model LTAAEL using a model that has been configured to represent the development and management rules defined by a system WSP (this refers to as LTAAEL model). We then compare this modelled LTAAEL with the modelled under current conditions long-term average annual extractions (LTAAEs) (which are usually those modelled by the annual permitted take, or APT, model). Although, the LTAAEL includes multiple types of water use, the compliance assessment is based on the total. We do this annually using the best available models, and the outcomes are published on the DPE website.\n\nWhere river system’s LTAAE exceed LTAAEL, the system is considered noncompliant. If the noncompliance trigger conditions in the WSP are met, noncompliance action is taken.\n\nThe data set provided contains flows at several gauges in each river system, as simulated by the annually extended LTAAEL model. Notwithstanding the model’s inherent limitations, these are a fair representation of those we would expect under WSP operation and development conditions. They can be compared with flows simulated by other key scenario models, such as annual permitted take (APT) model or without development (WOD) model.",

The maximum flood levels below Hobblers Bridge and in the Tamar are determined by South Esk discharges into the Tamar which provide higher elevations than the North Esk discharges for the same Average Recurrence Interval (ARI).This map is primarily intended for use in planning to that end it includes:A 100 year ARI profile with current sea level conditionsA 100 year ARI profile with 800mm rise in sea levelA 200 year ARI profileDischargesHydro Consulting was commissioned to review the South Esk hydrology while the North Esk hydrology was derived by the University of New South Wales Water Research laboratory. The Table 1 indicates the results of latter study used in the construction of this map.Flood Return Period in Years ARINorth Esk Flood Discharges (UNSW WRL 2006)South Esk Discharges (Hydro Consulting 2008)1034514302041918105052623301006142910200710(Monte Carlo Range)1850 3430 39905008514630Table 1The adopted tail-water level used in the North Esk analysis for this map was 2.1 m AHD at the junction with the Tamar for all discharges. This represents the highest astronomical tide at Launceston with average atmospheric pressure and neutral wind conditions. The North Esk model was successfully calibrated to the flood which occurred on 30thAugust 2005 which peaked at 470 cumecs and the flood which occurred on 21stJune 2011 at 251 cumecs.",

    "description": "This dataset contains hourly weather station temperature records that underpin all photovoltaic potential calculations in the Kalgoorlie-Boulder solar assessment collection. It provides the climate foundation essential for understanding and validating the irradiance and PV potential outputs.\n\nThe dataset consists of hourly temperature observations (°C) extracted from TMYx (Typical Meteorological Year) climate files for Kalgoorlie-Boulder Airport (2004-2018) weather station. These values are used to apply temperature-dependent efficiency adjustments to PV panel performance calculations, as solar panel output decreases with rising temperatures above 25°C standard test conditions.\n\nUsers can reference this data to verify climate inputs, understand the meteorological context of PV estimates, or conduct sensitivity analyses showing how temperature variations affect system performance. It is particularly valuable for researchers validating the methodology, engineers developing refined performance models, or policy analysts assessing climate scenario impacts on solar generation.\n\nThe data represents synthesised typical hourly conditions throughout the year based on historic weather conditions rather than actual hourly observations, designed to capture characteristic patterns while smoothing extreme anomalies. This approach ensures PV estimates reflect long-term average conditions suitable for planning purposes.\n\nThis dataset complements the georeferenced irradiance and potential datasets in the collection by providing a temporal climate context. For spatial PV analysis, users should reference the footprint-based datasets that incorporate these temperature values into location-specific calculations.\n\nComprehensive technical documentation, including data dictionary, usage examples, and processing methodology, is available in <a href=\"https://resources.aurin.org.au/ckan/resources/DataSet-Information.pdf\">here</a>; software stack details and calculation workflows are documented in <a href=\"https://resources.aurin.org.au/ckan/resources/Software_Stack.pdf\">here</a>.",

    "description": "This dataset presents aggregated data regarding employee jobs and median employee income per job, classified by industry subdivision at Statistical Area Level 4 (SA4). The data spans over the 2013-14 financial year and is aggregated to the 2016 SA4 boundaries.\nJobs in Australia provide aggregate statistics and are sourced from the Linked Employer-Employee Dataset (LEED). It provides new information about filled jobs in Australia, the people who hold them, and their employers. An 'employee Job' refers to a job for which the occupant receives remuneration in wages, salary, payment in kind, or piece rates. This excludes self-employment jobs held by Owner-Managers of Unincorporated Enterprises (OMUE).\nThe job counts in this release differ from the filled job estimates from other sources such as the Australian Labour Account and the Labour Force Australia. The Jobs in Australia release provides insights into all jobs held throughout the year, while the Labour Account data provides the number of filled jobs at a point-in-time each quarter (and annually for the financial year reference period), and Labour Force Survey data measures the number of people employed each month. \nFor more information on the release please visit the Australian Bureau of Statistics\nThis release provides statistics on the number and nature of jobs, the people who hold them, and their employers. These statistics can be used to understand regional labour markets or to identify the impact of major changes in local communities. The release also provides new insights into the number of jobs people hold, the duration of jobs, and the industries and employment income of concurrent jobs.\nThe scope of these data includes individuals who submitted an individual tax return to the Australian Taxation Office (ATO), individuals who had a Pay As You Go (PAYG) payment summary issued by an employer and their employers.\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data. The following additional changes were made:\n\n\nWhere data was not published for confidential reasons, \"np\" in the original data, the records have been set to null.\n\n\nTotal values may be higher than the sum of the published components due to this confidentialisation.\n\n",

Response times are an important measure of the service we provide, but are only one of a number of measures used to gauge the effective\ndelivery of an ambulance service. \nOur response times are measured from the receipt of the triple zero (000) call until paramedics arrive on scene. Response times are\ninfluenced by many factors including traffic, distance required to travel, availability of ambulances and demand for our services. \nWe designate those patients that require urgent paramedic and hospital care as \"Code 1,\" and these patients receive a \"lights and sirens\"\nresponse. The tables provide information about our Code 1 response time performance by both Local Government Area (LGA) and Urban Centres and Localities (UCL). Code 2 incidents are acute, but not time critical and do not require a lights and sirens response. AV's average Code 2 response time\nperformance has also been provided. \nAs part of our process of continual improvement, the response time performance shown below has been calculated using data sourced from\nthe Computer Aided Dispatch (CAD) system used across Victoria.  UCLs : These are geographical areas based on the Australian Bureau of Statistics\nUrban Centres and Localities (UCLs) boundaries and residential population.\nAmbulance Victoria reports performance for larger UCLs where population\nexceeds 7,500 persons.",

    "description": "Six scout drilling holes totalling 1020 feet of drilling were sunk by the Bureau in the Stony Pinch and Thornton Area, about 6 miles south-south-east of the City of Maitland in the Hunter Valley of N.S.W. The bores penetrated the Four Mile Creek beds and the Buttai Sandstone of the Tomago \"Stage\" of the \"Upper\" Coal Measures. In the absence of reliable stratigraphical control, the seams cannot be correlated with much certainty. Bore BMR 4 Stony Punch indicated that Donaldson's Seam(?) is thin and much banded; the coal, excluding bands, has an ash content of about 15% and calorific value of 12,300 B.Th.U/lb. This same bore showed that the basal 7 feet 3 inches of the Big Ben Seam had an ash content of about 25% and calorific value of 10,600 B.Th.U/lb. if 8 inches of non-coal bands are excluded. The general results of the drilling were that the coal seams were heavily banded, variable and high in inherent ash. Accordingly the prospecting was halted after drilling six holes.",

    "description": "This dataset presents the footprint of the rate of hospitalisations with a procedure for cataract surgery per 1,000,000 Indigenous population by client location. The location of the client is based on their place of usual residence. The data spans the financial years between 2014-2016 and is aggregated to 2015 Department of Health Primary Health Network (PHN) areas, based on the 2011 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS). \nThe data is sourced from the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare (AIHW) - National Hospital Morbidity Database (NHMD), which is a compilation of episode-level records from admitted patient care data collection systems in Australian hospitals in each state and territory. The NHMD is based on data provided to the AIHW by state and territory health authorities for the National minimum data set (NMDS) for Admitted patient care.\nFor further information about this dataset, visit the data source: Australian Institute of Health and Welfare - Indigenous Eye Health Measures 2017 Data Tables.\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data using the Department of Health - PHN Areas.\n\n\nThe data are crude rates.\n\n\nData by PHN should be interpreted with caution due to variations in admission practices, and because patients may be hospitalised outside the PHN where they reside.\n\n\nAlmost all (96%) cataract surgery in Australia is undertaken on a same-day basis. The data may underestimate the number of procedures provided as they do not include those undertaken on an outpatient basis.\n\n\nThe quality of data provided for Indigenous status varies. Time-series analyses may also be affected by changes in the quality of Indigenous identification over time.\n\n",

    "description": "This dataset shows the footprints of all structures within the City of Melbourne. A building footprint is a 2D polygon (or multi-polygon) representation of the base of a building or structure. The footprint is defined as the boundary of the structure where the walls intersect with the ground plane or podium, rather than an outline of the roof area (roofprint).\n\nWhere a building has a significant change in built form, multiple footprint polygons are ‘stacked’ vertically to define shape of the built form. This includes, and is not limited to:\n\n- Tower\n- Podium\n- Setbacks/offsets\n\nTo see the footprints in 3D please refer to our Development Activity Model  \n\nThe Australian Height Datum (AHD) is the national vertical datum for Australia. The National Mapping Council adopted the AHD in May 1971 as the datum to which all vertical control mapping would be referred\n\nThe data was captured in May 2018.",

The data production usually occurs in conjunction with the development of the Local Enviornmental Plan it is connected to. Original data inputs are produced by Local Goverment or the Department according to map and data standards developed by the Department and published externally via the website. These data inputs are checked by data and cartographic staff as well as planning staff internally against the map and data standards as well as for accurate content. Once the planning instrument is notified, the input data will be incorporated into the relevant LEP datasets. The quality management processes involved in the data production to this point are routinely screened by internal and external auditors for certification under ISO 9001 - Quality Management Systems. At this point the various datasets are then combined into a new normalised data schema to suit the requirements of the online Planning Viewer. This occurs via various automated ETL processes. Although every care is taken in ETL processes to maintain accuracy sometimes differences between inputs and final normalised data can occur.Data ClassificationUnclassifiedData Access PolicyOpenData QualityEnvironmental Planning Instrument - Height of Buildings (HOB) | Dataset | SEEDData BrokerNSW Department of Planning, Housing and Infrastructuredata.broker@environment.nsw.gov.auTerms and ConditionsCreative CommonsStandard and SpecificationEnvironmental Planning Instrument - Height of Buildings (HOB) | Dataset | SEEDData BrokerNSW Department of Planning, Housing and Infrastructuredata.broker@environment.nsw.gov.auData CustodianData BrokerNSW Department of Planning, Housing and Infrastructuredata.broker@environment.nsw.gov.auPoint of ContactData BrokerNSW Department of Planning, Housing and Infrastructuredata.broker@environment.nsw.gov.auData AggregatorData BrokerNSW Department of Planning, Housing and Infrastructuredata.broker@environment.nsw.gov.auData DistributorSEED.nsw.gov.auEnvironmental Planning Instrument - Height of Buildings (HOB) | Dataset | SEEDAdditional Supporting InformationEnvironmental Planning Instrument - Height of Buildings (HOB) | Dataset | SEEDEnvironmental Planning Instrument - Height of Buildings (HOB) | Data Quality Statement | SEEDTRIM Number",

The habitat types depicted in the dataset include rocky reef, sand, hard sand and seagrass. The data was collected in April 2005 by marine researchers at the Tasmanian Aquaculture and Fisheries Institute. The shallow waters of the estuaries enabled the use of aerial photography imagery as the primary data source. The habitats defined in the imagery required thorough checking in the field via underwater camera equipment, echo sounder data, and a Differential GPS unit to enable field checking of the image interpretation. The dataset is intended to be used to fulfil coastal management objectives according to The Living Marine Resources Act 1995 and to support Natural Resource management priorities in the Cradle Coast NRM region of Tasmania.",

    "description": "    \n\nMean annual (00) and monthly (01a|12) transpiration (mm) from the plant canopy\nfor the period 1980-1999.Interpretation:Canopy transpiration is far more\nspatially variable than potential evaporation, reflecting the effects of water\nlimitation in most areas of the continent. Both the annual mean and seasonal\npattern broadly resemble the corresponding patterns for rainfall. Canopy\ntranspiration maps have more acontrasta (relative variation) than the total\nevaporation or rainfall maps because transpiration is a small component of\ntotal evaporation in areas of low plant cover (the remainder being soil\nevaporation).The partitioning between soil evaporation and canopy\ntranspiration in the model is determined by leaf area index.Notes: These are\nmodel-based estimates from the BiosEquil model. Results are given for the\naBASEa (pre-1788) and aAGRICa (present day) conditions.

    "description": "This dataset presents the footprint of the number of installations of solar water heater (SWH) solar panel systems. The data spans the months of 2017 and includes a total for the year. The data is aggregated to Postal Areas (POAs) from the 2016 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nEvery month the Clean Energy Regulator (CER) publishes small-scale renewable energy installation data files. These data files provide a list of small generation units (SGU) (small-scale solar panel, wind and hydro systems) and kW capacity by installed postcode, and SWH and air source heat pumps by installed postcode. The data represents all systems that have had certificates validly created against them. The data includes new installations, upgrades to existing systems and stand-alone (off-grid) systems. This data is not publicly available via the Renewable Energy Certificate (REC) Registry and does not include systems that are pending registration or have been failed by the CER.\nFor further information about this dataset, visit the data source:Clean Energy Regulator - Postcode Data for Small-scale Installations.\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data by joining the data with the 2016 ASGS POAs\n\n\nThe data is current as at 30-09-2018.\n\n\nRenewable Energy Target (RET) legislation allows a 12 month creation period for registered persons to create their certificates.\n\n\nSmall-scale technology certificates are calculated based on the life of the system. This differs for solar hot water heaters and small generation units (solar panels, wind and hydro). Further information can be found at theRenewable Energy Target FAQ.\n\n",

    "description": "As part of the Healthy Waterways Strategy 2018 (HWS2018) the Melbourne Water operating region was split into a series of sub-regions. This includes 5 catchments, and 69 sub-catchments. The boundaries of each region generally follow catchment boundaries. There are two separate spatial scales:- Catchments (5 regions: Werribee, Maribyrnong, Yarra, Dandenong, Westernport) and Sub-catchments (69 polygons). This dataset is an update to the Regional River Health Strategy (RRHS) Management Units layer created in 2008. Primary purpose of this data is for reporting of targets, performance objectives, conditions, values etc. relating to the Healthy Waterways Strategy.\n\n\n\nThe sub-catchments in this dataset are an update of the &quot;management units&quot; developed for the Regional River Health Strategy in 2008. This dataset was created by merging sub-catchments from the University of Melbourne sub-catchments layer, commonly referred to as the DCI layer (where DCI refers to Directly Connected Imperviousness). The catchment polygons in this layer are similar to, but not exactly the same as those in the DCI layer currently used internally at Melbourne Water - The internally used layer has 15,901 polygon catchments, whilst the layer used to create this dataset has 16,346 polygon catchments. The Melbourne Water internal dataset will shortly be updated to align.\n\n\n\nNOTE: Whilst every effort has been taken in collecting, validating and providing the attached data, Melbourne Water Corporation makes no representations or guarantees as to the accuracy or completeness of this data. Any person or group that uses this data does so at its own risk and should make their own assessment and investigations as to the suitability and/or application of the data. Melbourne Water Corporation shall not be liable in any way to any person or group for loss of any kind including damages, costs, interest, loss of profits or special loss or damage, arising from any use, error, inaccuracy, incompleteness or other defect in this data.",

    "description": "A unique relationship exists between neighbouring males and females in the fiddler crab Uca capricornis. This experiment was designed to demonstrate how a male fiddler crab responds to different individuals tethered near to his burrow. The response of a male crab to the neighbour and a stranger (with similar physical characteristics) was observed. The trial ended when the focal male touched the tethered individual (approach), or after 5 minutes passed with no approach (ignore). The order of the two trials (neighbour or stranger) was random. 80 experiments were conducted in total, 20 of each of the following combinations: i) male -- neighbouring male, ii) male -- strange male, iii) male -- neighbouring female, iv) male -- strange female. \n\nThe results indicate that males treat female neighbours differently to male neighbours and intruders (of either sex). They were less likely to approach a female neighbour than an unknown female tethered in the same spot. They were equally likely to approach an unknown female, a neighbouring male and an unknown male.",

    "description": "<strong>What is the NSW Habitat Link Value (HLV) Index?</strong>\n\nThe NSW Habitat Link Value (HLV) Index estimates the relative contribution each location across NSW makes to terrestrial habitat connectivity across multiple ecological scales. The HLV Index, when mapped, provides a visualisation of a region's connectivity network. A high HLV indicates that the area may function as an important corridor for a range of species movements and ecological processes such as foraging, dispersal and migration. Since the relative contribution a location makes to habitat connectivity can increase when habitat is lost elsewhere, an increase in HLV does not necessarily indicate an improvement in habitat connectivity. Therefore, the HLV Index should not be used to measure how well-connected habitat is at any location or within a region. The related <a href=\"https://datasets.seed.nsw.gov.au/dataset/nsw-nhi-index\">NSW Neighbourhood Intactness (NHI) Index</a> is best suited to this purpose. The NSW HLV Index is a multi-scale application of the habitat link value (Li) analysis along with the related neighbourhood habitat area (Ni) that underpins the NSW NHI index.\n\n<strong>How are the data created?</strong>\n\nThe NSW HLV Index is created using the NSW Habitat Intactness (HI) Index as an input to a multi-scale habitat link value (Li) analysis. Least cost paths between good condition habitats are mapped at different spatial resolutions then averaged at each 90 x 90m pixel location to measure its contribution to habitat connectivity generalised across a range of ecological scales. The NSW HI Index combines direct measures of remotely sensed vegetation cover with measures inferred from other data sources using expert input to estimate terrestrial habitat intactness (See the <a href=\"https://datasets.seed.nsw.gov.au/dataset/nsw-habitat-intactness-index\">NSW HI Index Information Sheet</a> for further details).  \n\n<strong>What data are available?</strong>\n\nData are initially available annually from 2017, currently with a two-year time lag for the most recent layer due to the availability of NSW Habitat Intactness inputs. Data for other periods may be generated as needed. Layers provide near-complete statewide coverage but are limited by the NSW Habitat Intactness inputs available at the time of each assessment, and their accuracy, currency and completeness.\n\nData details:   \n<ul>\n<li>Data type: raster, GeoTIFF, 32bit floating point</li>\n<li>CRS: EPSG:3577 - GDA94 / Australian Albers </li>\n<li>Pixel size: 90 x 90m</li>\n<li>Pixel values: 0.0 (lowest HLV) to 1.0 (highest HLV)</li>\n<li>Null value: -9999</li>\n</ul>\n\n<strong>What can the data be used for?</strong>\n\nThe NSW Habitat Link Value has been used to map ecological connectivity (<a href=\"https://www.environment.nsw.gov.au/publications/integrated-model-data-fusion-approach-measuring-habitat-condition-ecological-integrity-reporting\">Love et al. 2020</a>) and provides a visualisation of a region's connectivity network. This mapping can be used to inform the connectivity strategy (priorities for improving the persistence of biodiversity) by highlighting opportunities for conserving, enhancing and building important habitat networks between concentrations of high-quality habitat. Connectivity can be mapped across structurally distinct habitat types and at various spatial resolutions, for jurisdictional reporting, and in the context of climate-induced shifts to environmental niches (<a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304380021003963?via%3Dihub\">Drielsma et al. 2022</a>). The HLV can be contextualised with additional sources of information to identify preferred habitat corridors for different contexts.   ",

    "description": "Urban Habitat Connectivity Project (UHCP)\n\nShort description: A package of data containing potential habitat and fragmentation for seven species groups in the urban ACT. Each species group has two layer files. Connected habitat layers show potential core and corridor habitat for the species group, and connectivity/fragmentation between these habitat patches. Remnant patches layers contain areas which are predicted to be fragmented and inaccessible for the species group, but may be important for restoration activities. These layers are outputs of ecological connectivity modelling and have been developed using spatial data representing habitat and connectivity requirements specific to the species group.\n\nThe following attributes are available in the data table for Connected Habitat layers:\n\n\n<ul><li>Species Group* - indicates the species group of interest</li><li>Patch ID – a unique identifier for each ‘patch’ of connected habitat, an ID that is given to group all habitat areas which are predicted to be connected to each other.</li><li>Habitat Type* – identifies if the polygon meets core or corridor habitat requirements, or if it is a remnant patch.</li><li>Habitat Number – a numeric value linked to Habitat Type to support statistics and symbology. Core habitat has a value of 0 and corridor habitat has a value of 1.</li><li>Patch Area (Ha)* – the area of the individual polygon in hectares.</li><li>Connected Habitat Area (Ha) – the total area of potential habitat in the connected patch, determined by summing the Patch Area for all polygons with the same Patch ID.</li><li>Shape area – the polygon’s area, calculated by default in meters squared.</li><li>Shape length – the length of the line enclosing the polygon, calculated by default in meters squared.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n* Is also available in the data table for Remnant Patches layers.\n\nSpatial resolution: 1:10,000\n\nCoordinate system: GDA2020 MGA zone 55\n\nMETHODS\n\nData collection / creation: <a>Spatial layers for habitat and barriers were created and input into a habitat connectivity/fragmentation model specifically designed for the species group. The model was developed using metrics derived from expert elicitation. These metrics quantified essential habitat and connectivity requirements for the species group, for example the preferred spacing of trees, the maximum crossable width of a road, the typical dispersal distance, etc. </a>The model identified habitat and barriers to connectivity, based on the metrics which could be mapped. Habitat was delineated by patch size to determine core and corridor habitat, and to remove areas which are too small to be functional. The habitat type is visible in the attribute table of the data.\n\nConnectivity between habitat patches is dependent on the species group’s dispersal capacity and the availability of core habitat, suitable corridors and a path without barriers. To assess this core habitat areas were buffered by the species group’s dispersal distance. This identified how far an individual will move to find a new core habitat patch. Movement to this distance is dependent on a suitable path. All habitat was buffered by the distance the species can move outside habitat (through non-habitat areas). This identified how far an individual will move outside any habitat (core or corridor) before they require another habitat patch (i.e. how far they can travel between stepping stones).Connectivity is further complicated by impassable barriers. Barriers were used to slice up the dispersal buffers and identify ‘dispersal patches’, areas which an individual can move within. Fragmentation is seen when a barrier is present, patches are too far from core habitat, or corridor habitat is too far apart.\n\nA unique ID was applied to each patch and represents connectivity/fragmentation. The patches were intersected with habitat to apply the new ID to the habitat areas. The final model outputs identify areas of potential core, corridor or remnant (inaccessible) habitat. Core and corridor habitat are viewable in the connected habitat dataset, whilst remnant patches are available separately. The data was simplified using the Douglas-Peuker algorithm, a tolerance of 0.5-2m, minimum size of 2-5m2 for retention, and holes filled in if less than 20m2. Small adjoining slithers &lt;20m2 were dissolved into neighbouring polygons to optimise drawing speeds. Please contact the project team for the model script or further details on the methodology.\n\nNOTES ON USE\n\nQuality: The habitat connectivity modelling used to produce the data was informed by work by the City of Melbourne <a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/331035992_Linking_Nature_in_the_City_A_framework_for_improving_ecological_connectivity_across_the_City_of_Melbourne\">(Kirk et al., 2018)</a>. The original methods were expanded on, with habitat and connectivity requirements (metrics) specific to the species group determined from expert elicitation and further analysis to consider patch size for core or corridor patches. The expert elicitation process provided the best and most relevant quantitative description of habitat and barriers available (for a species group rather than a specific species). The input datasets were then tailored to the metrics for this project. Existing datasets were refined to be relevant and reflect the metrics identified through expert elicitation. New datasets were created where data was missing. All data was derived from existing authoritative sources and/or remotely sensed data. This data curation process ensured the input datasets, and resulting output, were relevant and fit for purpose.\n\nLimitations: This data should be considered indicative only as there are limitations to the modelling process. It considers all habitat and barriers equally and as discrete objects (i.e. it applies a discrete boundary around a patch and does not account for gradients or flexible boundaries).The model predicts habitat and connectivity based on the data available. It does not assess whether a species is present or consider temporal variability. Some habitat requirements are not mapped (e.g. native vegetation, lack of predators) due to the lack of an accurate or complete dataset. Some of these requirements are critical to the success of the species group. These habitat requirements are available and have been derived from expert elicitation. They should be considered at an area of interest.\n\nThe model assumes the input data is up to date and accurate. Many of the habitat and barrier datasets used as inputs into the models are in some way informed by remote sensing data. Remote sensing data has limitations, such as potential for misclassification (e.g. bare ground and pavement could be confused). Additionally, remotely sensed data captures a point in time and will become outdated. Manual checks and improvements using supplementary data for specific sites have been completed to reduce as much error as possible.\n\nData refinement: Unmapped habitat and connectivity requirements should be considered when using the data. The full list of known habitat and connectivity requirements for each species group, including those considered by the model and those unaccounted for, is available by request. Other data may also be used to track changes post-LiDAR capture. For example, new development footprints may be used to remove non-habitat areas and can be done so at a faster rate than waiting for new LiDAR captures and re-running the model.\n\n\n\nSHARING\n\nLicenses/restrictions on use: Creative Commons By Attribution 4.0 (Australian Capital Territory)\n\nHow to cite this data: ACT Government, 2023.

    "description": "This dataset presents counts of payment recipients by payment type for the quarter ending June 2016. The data is based on the recipient's geocoded address aggregated by Local Government Area (LGA) from the Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS) 2014.\nThe Department of Social Services (DSS) is the Australian Government's lead agency in the development and delivery of social policy, and is working to improve the lifetime wellbeing of people and families in Australia. DSS' policies and services respond to need across people's lives - looking after families, children and older people; providing a safety net for people who cannot fully support themselves; enhancing the wellbeing of people with high needs; assisting people who need help with care; and supporting a diverse and harmonious society. DSS supports people and families in Australia by encouraging independence and participation, and supporting a cohesive society.\nFor more information on this dataset please visit the Australian Government Open Data.\nFor further details on payments, see 'A guide to Australian Government payments'.\nPlease note:\n\n\nIn order to protect individuals' privacy, identified populations between 1 and 4 have been suppressed and replaced with '&lt;5' for confidentiality purposes. Additional data may be suppressed and replaced with 'n.p.' (not provided) to prevent the derivation of identified populations that have values of less than 5.\n\n\nIndividuals who live overseas, individuals who are without a valid home address and individuals who only have a postal address cannot be assigned to a locational boundary. State/territory totals derived from Local Government Area data will not match actual state and territory totals, due to different statistical geography methodologies.\n\n\nCaveats specific to payments type can be found in the relevant payment description of the original data.\n\n\nAURIN has spatialised this dataset and have made the following replacements to enforce data type consistency: \n\n\n'&lt;5' has been assigned a value of '-1' within the data\n\n\nA boolean field has been created for each data field to flag left-censored data. 'True' is assigned to fields that have been censored.\n\n\n'n.p.' (not provided) has been set to Null within the data.\n\n",

This dataset provides trust, satisfaction and experience Survey results across a variety of indicators. The Survey was previously called the Citizen Experience Survey. \r\n\r\nAs of June 2022, more than 43,000 people, aged 18 years and over, have participated in the Survey. Between March 2019 and June 2021, eight survey waves, each surveying approximately 2,500-5,000 people, were conducted. Since July 2021, twelve additional waves of approximately 1,000 people each month have been conducted and analysed. Continued regular data collection has enabled creation of a reliable time series of data.\r\n\r\nThe design of the Survey ensures people reflect on their experiences with Australian public services (also known as Commonwealth, Federal or National public services) and not state, territory or local public services, or Government or policy.\r\n \r\nParticipation in the Survey is voluntary and information collected is anonymous and de-identified. The Survey is nationally representative of age, state/territory and gender. Survey participants consent to the publication of results in aggregate. \r\n\r\nWhen reporting Trust in Australian public services data, the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet must be attributed as the source. \r\n \r\nAdditional detail on the Survey is available on the APS Reform website at https://www.apsreform.gov.au/trustsurvey and at the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet website at https://www.pmc.gov.au ",

    "description": "Heat Vulnerability Index (HVI) including heat exposure, sensitivity, and adaptive capability indicators were created for whole Australia.The dataset supports the development of a national heat vulnerability assessment toolkit for Australia, designed to identify areas and populations most susceptible to heat-related risks. The project addresses the growing need for understanding the relationship between urbanization, land surface temperature (LST), and the urban heat island effect, particularly for vulnerable communities. Integrating satellite-derived environmental data (LST, Normalized Difference Built-up Index (NDBI), Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI)) with socioeconomic data, this toolkit provides a comprehensive resource for building heat-resilient cities and suburbs.\nThis dataset includes both raw environmental data for the 2020-2021 Australian summer (November to March) and a calculated Heat Vulnerability Index (HVI) aggregated to the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) Statistical Area Level 1 (SA1) polygon dataset. The HVI, based on the IPCC's vulnerability conceptual framework, is a composite index comprised of three core components: heat exposure (derived from LST), sensitivity to heat (influenced by socioeconomic factors), and adaptive capability. Each SA1 is assigned a vulnerability rating ranging from 0 to 5, with 0 indicating no population and 5 representing high vulnerability, based on the aggregated indicator scores and quartile distribution.\nThe methodology employs Google Earth Engine (GEE) to derive LST, NDBI, and NDVI.  The HVI, along with its components, allows for spatial analysis and facilitates understanding of the complex relationships between heat, environmental factors, and socioeconomic conditions, enabling targeted policy and decision-making at local levels. This work aims to support dynamic and interactive vulnerability assessment, enabling users to update and construct their own indicators and indices for diverse applications.\nDetailed methodology for HVI generation can be found in this paper. Additional resources are available on the project's GitHub repository, the web application, and the toolkit.",

    "description": "The stand condition of river red gums, black box and coolibah have been identified as objectives to measure the progress towards achieving outcomes of the Murray-Darling Basin Plan. The Murray-Darling Basin Authority (MDBA) commissioned a spatial stand condition assessment tool of these trees in 2014. The tool defined the extent of these communities by using a predictive model based on existing vegetation mapping and an analysis of satellite images. \r\nThe assessment tool involves a combination of quantitative ground surveys, remote sensing and modelling using machine learning. The ground surveys record the percentage of live leaf area, plant area index and crown extent. These parameters have been identified as being reliable and objective indicators of stand condition in floodplain forests.\r\n\r\nThe assessment tool was backdated to 2009, and then updated every year up to 2016 using Landsat 8 imagery. The assessment was not completed for 2011 and 2013 due to corrupt Landsat 7 imagery and flooding preventing completion of fieldwork.\r\n\r\nThe MDBA has made the assessment tool related resources publicly available as part of its commitment to the Australian Government policy on public data and information. Due to the large file size, the following files are not uploaded to www.data.gov.au but are available on request from gis@mdba.gov.au. \r\n\r\n   •\tStand Condition Assessment tool - Stand Condition Assessment tool software (.exe; 299MB)\r\n\r\n   •\tInput Data - six epochs of 2009, 2010, 2012-2016 and Landsat time composite images (floating point raster image)\r\n\r\n   •\t Output data - Stand condition time series shapefiles (six epochs between 2009-2016) for red gum, black box and coolibah (geodatabase of shape files; 990MB)\r\n\r\n   •\tOutput data - four bands Landsat stand condition output image with bands one to four contains crown extent, plant area index, live basal area and condition score respectively (floating point raster image; 331GB – approximately 50GB per epoch).\r\n\r\nThe Terms and conditions for using the data and related resources from this website can be found at https://www.data.gov.au/about.",

The data spans over the 2017-18 financial year and is aggregated to the 2016 SA2 boundaries.\nJobs in Australia provide aggregate statistics and are sourced from the Linked Employer-Employee Dataset (LEED). It provides new information about filled jobs in Australia, the people who hold them, and their employers. An 'employee Job' refers to a job for which the occupant receives remuneration in wages, salary, payment in kind, or piece rates. This excludes self-employment jobs held by Owner-Managers of Unincorporated Enterprises (OMUE).\nThe job counts in this release differ from the filled job estimates from other sources such as the Australian Labour Account and the Labour Force Australia. The Jobs in Australia release provides insights into all jobs held throughout the year, while the Labour Account data provides the number of filled jobs at a point-in-time each quarter (and annually for the financial year reference period), and Labour Force Survey data measures the number of people employed each month. \nFor more information on the release please visit the Australian Bureau of Statistics\nThis release provides statistics on the number and nature of jobs, the people who hold them, and their employers. These statistics can be used to understand regional labour markets or to identify the impact of major changes in local communities. The release also provides new insights into the number of jobs people hold, the duration of jobs, and the industries and employment income of concurrent jobs.\nThe scope of these data includes individuals who submitted an individual tax return to the Australian Taxation Office (ATO), individuals who had a Pay As You Go (PAYG) payment summary issued by an employer and their employers.\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data. The following additional changes were made:\n\n\nWhere data was not published for confidential reasons, \"np\" in the original data, the records have been set to null.\n\n\nTotal values may be higher than the sum of the published components due to this confidentialisation.\n\n",

    "description": "The Mobile Network Hardening Program (MNHP) is an Australian Government initiative that assists the mobile network operators, infrastructure providers and infrastructure managers to improve the resilience of Australia's regional mobile network telecommunications infrastructure to:\r\n\r\n* prevent outages in the event of a Natural Disaster;\r\n* strengthen the resilience of telecommunications facilities to allow them to operate for longer during bushfires and other Natural Disasters; and/or\r\n* enable the rapid restoration of services following an outage.\r\n\r\nRound 1 of the MNHP was funded through the Government's Strengthening Telecommunications Against Natural Disasters Initiative, announced in January 2020. Round 1 is providing $23.5 million (GST inclusive) in funding to Optus, Telstra and TPG the mobile network operators across two stages to deliver approximately 1,000 projects to strengthen the resilience of regional telecommunications infrastructure. \r\n \r\nThe first stage is funding Optus, Telstra and TPG to enhance the battery backup power at 466 base stations funded under the first two rounds of the Government's Mobile Black Spot Program. These upgrades will increase backup operation at these base stations to at least 12 hours. \r\n \r\nThe second stage is funding Optus, Telstra and TPG to deliver over 530 resilience upgrades at mobile base station sites across Australia including the deployment of new portable and permanent generators to supply additional back-up power during power outages, the improvement of transmission resilience within regional mobile network clusters to reduce single points of network failure and addition and upgrades to battery systems.\r\n \r\nFor more information about the MNHP go to https://www.infrastructure.gov.au/mnhp",

It can be easily mapped using the geometry column. \n\nTree canopy polygons have been derived by ArborCarbon from high-resolution airborne multispectral imagery. ArborCarbon collected this imagery using the ArborCam, a unique 11-band airborne multispectral camera system optimized for the accurate detection of vegetation and subtle changes in vegetation condition. \n\nThe high-resolution airborne imagery datasets were geometrically corrected and orthorectified using the City of Melbourne’s publicly available 2018 aerial imagery and a Digital Terrain Model supplied by the City. A Digital Surface Model was generated from the acquired imagery for the full extent of the City, enabling the stratification of vegetation into a range of height categories. All vegetation &gt;3m above the ground was classified as canopy (excluding vegetation on building rooftops).",

    "description": "This dataset presents the total number of distinct specialist homeless services clients. The client counts are based on the location where the client resided in the week before their first support period in the financial year. Each client contributes only once, even if they had multiple support periods during the financial year. The data spans the financial years of 2014-15 to 2018-19 and is aggregated to 2016 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS) Statistical Area Level 4 (SA4).\nThe Specialist Homelessness Services Collection (SHSC) data accompanies the Specialist Homelessness Services Annual Report 2018-19.\nFor further information about this dataset, visit the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare - SHSC Data Cubes User Guide.\nNotes:\n\n\nCaution should be used when comparing data for 2017-18 onwards with data for 2014-15 to 2016-17 in sub-state data cubes. Data for 2011-12 to 2016-17 at the state, territory and national levels are weighted to account for agency non-response and invalid statistical linkage keys (SLK), and have been rounded to the nearest integer. Due to improvements in agency response and rates of SLK validity, data from 2017–18 are no longer weighted. The removal of weighting does not constitute a break in time series, and these data are directly comparable with weighted counts for earlier years.

    "description": "A gravity core (GC12) was collected from a depth of 990.5 mbsl within the Capricorn Channel, southern Great Barrier Reef (GBR). Analysis of other parameters revealed the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) sitting at a depth of ~175cm into the core. Four samples were collected for X-ray Diffraction (XRD) analysis; the top two, at the sediment surface (GC12-0) and at 30cm (GC12-30) represent interglacial sediment, while the lower two, at 210cm (GC12-210) and 330cm (GC12-330) represent glacial sediment. XRD analysis suggests that the majority of the carbonate is calcite during the interglacials, primarily from pelagic carbonate production. During the glacials and transitions more quartz, feldspar, aragonite and Mg calcite are present. This suggests that there is a changing dominance of pelagic, terrigenous and reef platform material within the core related to sea-level variations.",

    "description": "This dataset presents aggregated data regarding the number of people employed in multiple jobs and their respective median income by the relevant statistical regions. The data spans from 2014/2015 to 2018/2019 financial year and is aggregated to the 2016 Greater Capital City Statistical Area (GCCSA) boundaries.\nJobs in Australia is a new release that provides aggregate statistics from the recently developed Linked Employer-Employee Dataset (LEED). It provides new information about filled jobs in Australia, the people who hold them, and their employers.\nJobs in Australia describes all job relationships accumulated over the course of a year. This means that job counts in this publication are higher than the estimates of filled jobs published in the quarterly Australian Labour Account, which provides a point-in-time, or stock measure. These statistics about jobs also differ from Labour Force Survey statistics, which estimate the number of people who held a job in each month.\nThis data is Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) data (catalogue number: 6160.0) used with permission from the ABS.\nFor more information on the release please visit the Australian Bureau of Statistics\nThe purpose of this publication is to provide new information about the number and nature of filled jobs in Australia, the people who hold them, and their employers. It includes information about multiple job-holding and employment in local areas. Jobs in Australia counts all jobs held during the reference year. This complements and expands on quarterly stock estimates of filled jobs presented in the Australian Labour Account.\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data. The following additional changes were made:\n\n\nWhere data was not published for confidential reasons, \"np\" in the original data, the records have been set to null.\n\n\nTotal values may be higher than the sum of the published components due to this confidentialisation.\n\n",

However, suitable placement of correctly filled bags may reduce the amount of water that enters your property. Sandbagging is a self-help process for residents; however, the SES may be able to provide assistance to individuals physically unable to get their own sandbags due to illness, age or other incapacity. If assistance is required, the SES can be contacted on 132 500. Where possible, purchase the items needed to make your own sandbags from local hardware stores and landscape supply businesses.",

    "title": "An atlas of the lakes of the Larsemann Hills, Princess Elizabeth Land, Antarctica - ANARE Research Notes 74",
    "description": "From the abstract of the ANARE Research Note:\r\n\r\nThe Larsemann Hills are a series of granite and gneiss peninsulas extending into Prydz Bay, between the Amery Ice Shelf and the Sorsdal Glacier.  They are dissected by steep-sided valleys produced by at least two glacial stages in the Holocene.  There are over 150 freshwater lakes in the hills, ranging from small ponds less than 1 m deep, to glacial lakes up to 10 ha and 38 m deep.  The lakes are young, with the oldest basins being about 9000 years old. Variations in the characteristics of the lakes reflect deglaciation history, proximity to the continental ice margin and exposure to the ocean.  The main source of the water is snow melt, augmented by sea spray into the more exposed lakes.  The waters are well mixed by katabatic winds.  Most lakes thaw for up to 2 months in summer, but some are permanently frozen.\r\n\r\nThe waters have mainly low conductivity and exceptionally low turbidity, and have near-neutral pH values.  The ionic order is Na+ greater than Mg2+ greater than Ca2+ greater than K+.  This reflects a strong marine influence, with calcium dominating in a very few catchments.\r\n\r\nThe Larsemann Hills were discovered in 1935 by Captain Klarius Mikkelsen in the Thorshavn.  Australian, Chinese and Russian stations were established in the area in the mid-late 1980's.  Law (Australia) was commenced in 1986 when an Apple Hut was unloaded from MV Nella Dan.  A subsequent visit was made during the 1986 winter.  The first Australian scientific expedition visited the area during the 1986-87 austral summer.  Progress Station (Russia) was occupied at the time.  Building of Zhong Shan commenced in January 1989.\r\n\r\n*******************\r\n\r\nSeveral files are associated with this metadata record:\r\n\r\n1) A PDF copy of the original ANARE Research Note\r\n\r\n2) A CSV file containing the data presented in the ANARE Research Note\r\n\r\n3) A shapefile of the lakes presented in the ANARE Research Note\r\n\r\nThe fields in this dataset are:\r\n\r\nlake_id\r\n\r\nlake_name (text)\r\n\r\nlocation (text description)\r\n\r\nlongitude (decimal degrees)\r\n\r\nlatitude (decimal degrees)\r\n\r\naltitude (m)\r\n\r\nlake_area (ha)\r\n\r\ncatchment_area (ha)\r\n\r\nmaximum_depth (m)\r\n\r\ndimensions (m)\r\n\r\ndistance_from_polar_plateau (m)\r\n\r\ndescription (text)\r\n\r\ngeology (text)\r\n\r\nwater_temperature (C)\r\n\r\npH\r\n\r\nwater_conductivity (micro mho/cm)\r\n\r\nEh (reduction potential, mV)\r\n\r\nca_concentration (Ca++, ppm)\r\n\r\nmg_concentration (Mg++, ppm)\r\n\r\nna_concentration (NA+, ppm)\r\n\r\nk_concentration (K+, ppm)\r\n\r\nionic_ratios_na_ca_mg_k (ionic ratio of na:(ca+mg+mk))\r\n\r\nionic_ratios_ca_na_k_mg (ionic ratio of ca:(na+k+mg))\r\n\r\nbottom_sediment_grab_sample (text description of results)\r\n\r\n",

    "title": "The feeding ecology of the intertidal limpet, Siphonaria diemenensis at Griffith Point, Victoria.",
    "description": "This study was conducted from December 1979 to December 1981 to determine the diet of Siphonaria diemenensis in the high and low intertidal zone on the rocky shore at Griffith Point, San Remo, Victoria. \n\nGut contents analysis indicated that in both zones the limpets were feeding primarily on encrusting brown algae (e.g. Ralfsia verrucosa and Scytosiphon lomentaria). In an experimental manipulation, limpets were excluded from 15 x 15cm areas of rock to determine the change in algae cover in the presence and absence of limpets. Two runs of this experiment were conducted in Zone 1 from February to September and from September to December in 1980. The change in algae cover during the experiment was generally greater in the exclusion plots. This supports conclusions from the gut contents analysis, that encrusting brown algae form the major part of the diet of S.diemenensis.\n\nA growth experiment was conducted from 5 September to 15 November 1981 in Zone 1. There were 12 enclosures (15 x 15cm) with 15 limpets in each. Three enclosures were assigned to each of the 4 treatments; Ralfsia, Scytosiphon, scraped or bare. At the end of the experiment, 5 individuals were collected from each enclosure and their shell lengths and dry tissue weights measured. The mean shell length and dry tissue weights were greater in the Ralfsia and Scytosiphon treatments compared to the bare and scraped indicating that the presence of brown algae can be beneficial to this species of limpet. \n\nAlgal abundances were monitored throughout this study by analysing photographs of permanently marked quadrats (50 x 50cm) at each of the study sites (3 sites in Zone 1 and 2 sites in Zone 2). Photographs were taken at monthly intervals from December 1979 to December 1981. In Zone 1, there was a clear seasonal trend in algae cover with a minimum cover in summer (January to March) and a maximum in spring (August to December). In Zone 2, there was no seasonal trend but a 100% cover of encrusting brown algae at all times. \n\nIndividual adults were marked in both zones in April 1980 (42 in Zone 1 and 43 in Zone 2) and again in January 1981 (104 in Zone 1 and 66 in Zone 2) by cementing a small numbered label to the shell with a clear epoxy resin. The positions of marked individuals were measured regularly over a period of 8 weeks in 1980 and 1981. Over 70% of individuals were observed to home back to their original positions after 8 weeks with the remainder moving to new positions. Limpets were observed to begin to move at least 1 hour before being exposed to air on a receding tide, and to cease movement between 1 and 2 hours after they were uncovered.",

That is, 1:500 = 0.25m, 1:2000 = 1m, 1:4000 = 2m, 1:25000 = \n12.5m, 1:50000 = 25m and 1:100000 = 50m. A program to upgrade the spatial location and accuracy of data is ongoing.Spatial Reference System (dataset)GDA94Spatial Reference System (web service)EPSG:3857WGS84 Equivalent ToGDA94Spatial ExtentFull StateContent LineageFor additional information, please contact us via the Spatial Services Customer HubData ClassificationUnclassifiedData Access PolicyOpenData QualityFor additional information, please contact us via the Spatial Services Customer HubTerms and ConditionsCreative CommonsStandard and SpecificationOpen\n Geospatial Consortium (OGC) implemented and compatible for consumption \nby common GIS platforms.
