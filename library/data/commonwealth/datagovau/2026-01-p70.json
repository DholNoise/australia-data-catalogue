    "description": "This dataset consists of daily estimates of photic depth on the Great Barrier Reef from MODIS satellite imagery (from 2002 - 2015) using a quasi-analytical algorithm. This algorithm is based on a Type II linear regression of log-transformed satellite and in situ data (2002- 2012).\r\n\r\nThis algorithm was developed as part of data delivery for several NERP projects and was implemented into the NASA SeaDAS tool for processing MODIS imagery. This algorithm and its data products are now routinely run by the Bureau of Meteorology as part of the eReefs Water Quality Dashboard.\r\n\r\nThe data produced from this algorithm were key input datasets for the analysis of NERP TE project 4.1 and integrated as part of the NERP TE 2.3 GBR/TS environmental conditions reports.\r\n\r\n\r\nMethod:\r\n\r\nThe satellite imagery was first broken down into its estimated Inherent Optical Properties (IOP) using a quasi-analytical algorithm, outlined in [1]. This process converts the multi-spectral satellite images into an estimate of the various optical properties of the water such as backscattering and absorption of the water. The IOPs were then used to estimate the depth where 10% of the surface light (PAR) level was still available (Z10%). \r\nA regression of the in situ ZSD (secchi depth) values against the matching satellite estimates of Z10% was used to adjust the satellite-derived Z10% to ZSD. A Type II linear regression (RMA) of log-transformed satellite and in situ data was used to estimate ZSD for the GBR according to: \r\nZSD = 10^[{log10 (Z10%) - a0}/a1]\r\nwhere a0 and a1 are 0.529 and 0.816 for MODIS-Aqua (N = 71; r2 = 0.83; RMSE = 0.096).\r\n\r\nThe regional tuning parameters a0 and a1 were determined by regression between satellite and in-situ secchi depth measurements from AIMS and QDPI.\r\n\r\nMore details about the methods used to create this dataset can be found in [2].\r\n\r\n\r\nFormat:\r\n\r\nThis data is available in NetCDF raster format from the BOM Marine Water Quality THREDDS server. This server also makes the data available various formats from the following services: OpenDAP, WMS and WCS.\r\nhttp://ereeftds.bom.gov.au/ereefs/tds/catalogs/ereefs_data.html\r\n\r\nThe data for this dataset is available in the mwq P1D Aggregation, mwq P1W Aggregation, mwq P1M Aggregation, mwq P6M Aggregation, mwq P1A Aggregation service end points. These correspond to daily and weekly, monthly, 6 monthly and annual aggregates respectively. The secchi depth estimates correspond to the SD_MIM_* data layers in the service end points.\r\n\r\n\r\nReferences:\r\n\r\n1. Lee, Z.; Carder, K.L.; Arnone, R.A.

    "description": "This dataset presents the footprint of male cancer incidence statistics in Australia for all cancers combined and the 11 top cancer groupings (bladder, colorectal, head and neck, kidney, leukaemia, lung, lymphoma, melanoma of the skin, pancreas, prostate and stomach) and their respective ICD-10 codes. The data spans the years 2006-2010 and is aggregated to 2015 Department of Health Primary Health Network (PHN) areas, based on the 2011 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nIncidence data refer to the number of new cases of cancer diagnosed in a given time period. It does not refer to the number of people newly diagnosed (because one person can be diagnosed with more than one cancer in a year). Cancer incidence data come from the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare (AIHW) 2012 Australian Cancer Database (ACD).\nFor further information about this dataset, please visit:\n\n\nAustralian Institute of Health and Welfare - Cancer Incidence and Mortality Across Regions (CIMAR) books.\n\n\nAustralian Cancer Database 2012 Data Quality Statement.\n\n\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data using the Department of Health - PHN Areas.\n\n\nDue to changes in geographic classifications over time, long-term trends are not available.\n\n\nValues assigned to \"n.p.\" in the original data have been removed from the data.\n\n\nThe Australian and jurisdictional totals include people who could not be assigned a PHN. The number of people who could not be assigned a PHN is less than 1% of the total.\n\n\nThe Australian total also includes residents of Other Territories (Cocos (Keeling) Islands, Christmas Island and Jervis Bay Territory).\n\n\nThe ACD records all primary cancers except for basal and squamous cell carcinomas of the skin (BCCs and SCCs). These cancers are not notifiable diseases and are not collected by the state and territory cancer registries.\n\n\nThe diseases coded to ICD-10 codes D45-D46, D47.1 and D47.3-D47.5, which cover most of the myelodysplastic and myeloproliferative cancers, were not considered cancer at the time the ICD-10 was first published and were not routinely registered by all Australian cancer registries. The ACD contains all cases of these cancers which were diagnosed from 1982 onwards and which have been registered but the collection is not considered complete until 2003 onwards.\n\n\nNote that the incidence data presented are for 2006-2010 because 2011 and 2012 data for NSW and ACT were not able to be provided for the 2012 ACD.\n\n",

Clause 4.3 of the the Local Environment Plan (LEP) deals with building height, but clause 4.3 may also be subject to certain exceptions under other provisions of the Local Environment Plan (LEP). The HOB dataset describes the maximum building height allowed for areas. The height is defined as the vertical distance between ground level (existing) and/or AHD and the highest point of the building, including plant and lift overruns, but excluding communication devices, antennas etc.\n The original GIS data was captured by local councils, DP&amp;I and contractors and provided in accordance with the DP&amp;I's Standard Requirements for GIS LEP data and Standard Technical Requirements for LEP maps. Before the LEP is notified on the NSW Legislation website, the mapping is checked by DP&amp;I and the Parliamentary Council's Office to ensure that it is consistent with these standards. After the LEP is notified, the GIS data is quality controlled using an ISO 9001-Quality-Certified, Quality Management System and incorporated into the Statewide dataset.\n Height of Building relates directly to and adopts the accuracy of its reference dataset, Land and Property Information DCDB. The GIS data may be subject to change as a part of quality control, or if the LEP is amended. Please confirm dates of respective features before use as this dataset has a large temporal extent.",

    "description": "This data release consists of flux tower measurements of the exchange of energy and mass between the surface and the atmospheric boundary-layer in semi-arid eucalypt woodland using eddy covariance techniques. It been processed using PyFluxPro (v3.3.3) as described in Isaac et al. (2017), <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-14-2903-2017\">https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-14-2903-2017</a>. PyFluxPro takes data recorded at the flux tower and process this data to a final, gap-filled product with Net Ecosystem Exchange (NEE) partitioned into Gross Primary Productivity (GPP) and Ecosystem Respiration (ER). For more information about the processing levels, see <a href=\"https://github.com/OzFlux/PyFluxPro/wiki\">https://github.com/OzFlux/PyFluxPro/wiki</a>.\n  The site is located on a low lying plain dominated by Mitchell Grass (<em>gen. Astrebla</em>). Elevation of the site is close to 250m and mean annual precipitation at a nearby Bureau of Meteorology site is 640mm. Maximum temperatures range from 28.4°C (in June/ July) to 39.1°C (in December), while minimum temperatures range from 11.2°C (in July) to 24.4°C (in December).The instrument mast is 5 meters tall. Heat, water vapour and carbon dioxide measurements are taken using the open-path eddy flux technique. Temperature, humidity, wind speed, wind direction, rainfall and net radiation are measured. Soil heat fluxes are measured and soil moisture content is gathered using time domain reflectometry.Ancillary measurements taken at the site include LAI, leaf-scale physiological properties (gas exchange, leaf isotope ratios, N and chlorophyll concentrations), vegetation optical properties and soil physical properties. Airborne based remote sensing (Lidar and hyperspectral measurements) was carried out across the transect in September 2008. Biomass Harvest - mean live biomass: 0.00 gm-2 (standard error: 0.00) , mean standing dead biomass: 163.42 gm-2 (standard error: 16.73), mean litter biomass: 148.99 gm-2 (standard error: 21.32), total mean biomass: 312.40 gm-2 (standard error: 30.80), Soil- Clay: 14.47% (volume &lt;1µm), Silt: 51.23% (volume &lt;1µm), Sand: 34.30% (volume &lt;1µm), Sand (&gt;1 µm): 1.02% (total weight).",

The boundaries used for the dataset follow the 2011 edition of the Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nSmall Area Labour Markets presents regional estimates of unemployment and the unemployment rate at two small area levels:\n\n\nFor approximately 2,100 Australian Bureau of Statistics’ (ABS) Statistical Area Level 2s (SA2s), on a State/Territory and Metropolitan/Non-metropolitan basis; and\n\n\nFor each of Australia’s 540 Local Government Areas (LGAs).\n\n\nThe estimates in Table 1 and 2 are smoothed using a four-quarter average to minimise the variability inherent in small area estimates. A description of the methodology used to prepare the estimates in this publication is presented in the Explanatory Notes, as well as on page 43 of the PDF Publication.\nPlease note: \n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data.\n\n\nWhere data values were \"-\" (no data provided) in the original data they have been set to null.\n\n\nCaution: Highly disaggregated estimates of unemployment and the unemployment rate at the SA2 and LGA level can display significant variability and should be viewed with caution. Indeed, quarter-to-quarter comparisons may not be indicative of actual movements in the labour market. It is therefore recommended that year-on-year comparisons be used.\n\n",

The Buildings dataset has relationships with the G-NAF, Cadastre, Property and Administrative Boundaries products produced by Geoscape Australia. Users should note that these related Geoscape products are not part of Buildings.\nFor more information regarding Geoscape Buildings, please refer to the Data Product Description and the June 2022 Release Notes.\nPlease note: As per the licence for this data, the coverage area accessed by you can not be greater than a single Level 2 Statistical Area (SA2) as defined by the Australian Bureau of Statistics. If you require additional data beyond a single SA2 for your research, please request a quote from AURIN.\nBuildings is a digital dataset representing buildings across Australia. Data quality and potential capture timelines will vary across Australia based on two categories, each category has been developed based on a number of factors including the probability of the occurrence of natural events (e.g. flooding), population distribution and industrial/commercial activities. Areas with a population greater than 200, or with significant industrial/commercial activity in a visual assessment have been defined as 'Urban' and all other regions have been defined as 'Rural'. This dataset has been restricted to the Hobart SA2 by AURIN.",

    "description": "This thesis investigates the improvement of forecasting water temperature in a coastal embayment through the assimilation of satellite sea surface temperature (SST).  Port Phillip Bay (PPB) in southeastern Australia was used as a case study, where temperature forecasts could be compared against in situ temperature measurements. Over the long term satellite derived SST observations were found to have negligible bias, however a strong diurnal bias was apparent.  The  model of PPB replicated the main features of PPB well, although the temperature prediction was warm biased. \n\nThe actual assimilation of SST data was contrasted against a climatology forecast of PPB temperature.  The assimilation of SST, without any specific accounting for the diurnal bias improved the forecast, although errors due to observational bias were noted.  Attempts to remove this bias using diurnal correction algorithms failed, owing to a larger than expected cool skin. Conditional merging, which combines spatial and in situ observations, was applied to the SST observations and improved forecast accuracy by reducing the observation bias. This work demonstrates that forecasting models can be improved through the assimilation of satellite derived observations. An examination of the assimilation innovations indicated where the forecast accuracy could be further improved.",

    "description": "This dataset presents the footprint of participation statistics in the National Bowel Cancer Screening Program (NBCSP) for people aged 50 to 74. The NBCSP began in 2006. It aims to reduce morbidity and mortality from bowel cancer by actively recruiting and screening the eligible target population for early detection or prevention of the disease. The data spans the years of 2014-2017 and is aggregated to Statistical Area Level 3 (SA3) geographic areas from the 2011 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nCancer is one of the leading causes of illness and death in Australia. Cancer screening programs aim to reduce the impact of selected cancers by facilitating early detection, intervention and treatment. Australia has three cancer screening programs:\n\n\nBreastScreen Australia\n\n\nNational Cervical Screening Program (NCSP)\n\n\nNational Bowel Cancer Screening Program (NBCSP)\n\n\nThe National cancer screening programs participation data presents the latest cancer screening participation rates and trends for Australia's 3 national cancer screening programs. The data has been sourced from the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare (AIHW) analysis of National Bowel Cancer Screening Program register data, state and territory BreastScreen Australia register data and state and territory cervical screening register data.\nFor further information about this dataset, visit the data source:Australian Institute of Health and Welfare - National Cancer Screening Programs Participation Data Tables.\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data.\n\n\nParticipation rates represent the percentage of people invited to screen through the NBCSP during the relevant 2-year period, who returned a completed screening test within that period or by 30 June of the following year. The number of individuals invited to screen excludes those who deferred or opted out without completing their screening test.\n\n\nValues assigned to n.p. in the original data have been set to null.\n\n\nSA3 areas were assigned to NBCSP invitees using an SA2 to SA3 correspondence, which may lead to some minor inaccuracies in results.\n\n\nSome invitee SA2 codes and postcodes cannot be attributed to an SA3. These invitees were included in an 'Unknown' group where applicable.\n\n\nBiennial screening for those aged 50-74 is not fully rolled out. During the time period reported, the specific ages invited within the 50-74 age range included 50, 54, 55, 58, 60, 64, 65, 68, 70, 72 and 74.\n\n\nThese results calculate participation rates using the new NBCSP performance indicator specifications. This indicator now measures a 2-year invitation period and also excludes those who opted off or suspended participation. Therefore, these results cannot be compared to rates reported prior to 2014.\n\n\nNBCSP participation rates per area are not related to bowel cancer incidence rates.\n\n\nSA3 areas with a numerator less than 20 or a denominator less than 100 have been suppressed.\n\n\nSA3 data for the Blue Mountains - South, Christmas Island, Cocos (Keeling) Islands, Cotter - Nimadi, Fyshwick - Pialligo- Hume, Illawarra Catchment Reserve, Jervis Bay and Lord Howe Island were suppressed due to reliability concerns from low numbers in these regions.\n\n\nThe 2014-2015 period covers 1 January 2014 to 31 December 2015, the 2015-2016 period covers 1 January 2015 to 31 December 2016, and the 2016-2017 period covers 1 January 2016 to 31 December 2017.\n\n\nThe number of people in different SA3s may not sum to 'Australia' total due to rounding.\n\n",

By investigating the properties and components of this core we are able to reveal some information about this hemi-pelagic sedimentary environment over the last glacial / interglacial cycle. Information obtained or inferred from the core include the isotopic composition of oxygen and carbon through time, an age vs. depth profile and the percentage of grainsize fractions throughout the core. X-ray Diffraction (XRD) analyses were also run on several samples from each core to determine changes in the carbonate mineralogy and terrestrial influx, which provided further palaeoclimatic information.",

This project aims to investigate the polarization and emission properties of these pulsars through detailed modeling using the rotating vector model (RVM). Polarization profiles will be obtained over a wide frequency range, from 704 MHz to 4032 MHz. We will measure the emission height differences between the main pulse (MP) and IP as a function of frequency, allowing us to explore their frequency dependence and to test the radius-to-frequency mapping (RFM) model. Spectral analyses of individual profile components will be performed to constrain the emission properties and investigate differences between the MP and IP. Additionally, we will examine quasi-periodic microstructure in both MP and IP, aiming to characterize the microstructure period and explore its potential correlation with the magnetic inclination angle. This comprehensive investigation will yield new insights into the emission geometry of pulsars with IP emissions, contributing to a better understanding of their unique characteristics within the pulsar population.",

    "title": "Wallaby Creek Flux Data Release 2023_v1",
    "description": "This release consists of flux tower measurements of the exchange of energy and mass between the surface and the atmospheric boundary-layer using eddy covariance techniques. Data were processed using PyFluxPro (v3.5.0) as described by Isaac et al. (2017). PyFluxPro produces a final, gap-filled product with Net Ecosystem Exchange (NEE) partitioned into Gross Primary Productivity (GPP) and Ecosystem Respiration (ER).\n\nThe forest is classed as a tall, wet sclerophyll forest, and the dominant <em>Eucalyptus Regnans</em> or mountain ash trees have an average canopy height of 75&nbsp;m. The site contains a chronosequence of (20, 80 and 300) stand ages that were established during fires occurring over the last 300 years. The area is assigned the IUCN Category II (National Parks) of the United Nations’ list of National Parks and protected areas, which means the park is primarily managed for ecosystem conservation. The catchment area is dominated by mountain ash, the world’s tallest flowering plant (angiosperm). Trees can reach heights of more than 90&nbsp;m in areas with high rainfall and fertile soil. Mountain ash forests are confined to the cool mountain regions with elevations ranging from 460 to 1100&nbsp;m and average rainfalls of 1100 to 2000&nbsp;mm/y. These trees are well distributed throughout Victoria’s Central Highlands including the Otway Ranges and Strzlecki Ranges; they are also found in Tasmania. The catchment area contains a portion of the Mt. Disappointment range, the Divide and the headwaters of Wallaby Creek and Silver Creek, and much of the slopes are characterised as flat to moderate.\n\nThe station itself is located within an old growth stand with individual trees as old as 300 years. Below the dominant canopy lies a temperate rainforest understorey consisting of <em>Pomaderris aspera</em> and <em>Olearia argophylla</em> species, which are 10 to 18&nbsp;m tall. The lower layers of vegetation are dominated by tree ferns (<em>Cyathea australis</em> and <em>Dicksonia antartica</em>) and extensive tracts of rosette and rhizonic ferns (<em>Polystichum proliferum</em> and <em>Blechnum wattsii</em>) as well as acacia trees. The elevation is approximately 720&nbsp;m. The major soil type within the forest is krasnozemic soils, which are friable red/brown soils, with high amounts of organic matter in the upper 20 to 30&nbsp;cm. However, the composition of krasnozemic soils is not homogenous, but rather varies with altitude. Grey-yellow podsolised soils can be found at lower altitudes, while krasnozemic loams is characteristic of the higher altitudes of the Kinglake and of the Hume Plateau. The clay content of these soils increases with depth until at least 200&nbsp;cm deep, where after a transition soils contain rock fragments. The climate of the study area is classified as a cool, temperate zone, with the highest temperatures occurring during the summer months of December – February (13.8 to 22.5&nbsp;°C), whilst the coolest temperatures are experienced in May and August (4.7 to 9.2&nbsp;°C). Average annual precipitation is 1209&nbsp;mm, with a maximum rainfall occurring in June (Ashton, 2000). The study site experiences foggy conditions after sunset during autumn and winter.\n\nThe original station had a main mast at 110&nbsp;m. This station was destroyed in February 2009 by bushfires. A replacement station was established in March 2010 and started recording in May 2010. The mast sat at a height of 5&nbsp;m. The post-fire instrumentation was not as diverse as the pre-fire instrumentation.",

    "description": "The <a href=\"https://www.water.dcceew.nsw.gov.au/our-work/science-data-and-modelling/surface-water-science/river-assessment-tools\">NSW riverine High Ecological Value Aquatic Ecosystem (HEVAE) project</a> aims to identify and define a range of instream values and levels of importance for freshwater river reaches in NSW. These values will assist in the prioritisation of areas for focused water management, to assist with water sharing between water users and the environment. The water management options include assessment of access and trade rules within Water Sharing Plans (WSPs). The HEVAE product enables NSW DCCEEW Water to better meet water management requirements under the Water Management Act 2000 and Murray-Darling Basin Plan 2012.\n\nThe <a href=\"https://www.agriculture.gov.au/sites/default/files/documents/ae-toolkit-module-3-identifying-hevae.pdf\">HEVAE Framework</a> was developed by the Commonwealth Government as part of the Australian Aquatic Ecosystem Toolkit and has been adopted by NSW DCCEEW Water as a progressive step to replace other NSW instream value assessments with a National approach. Although the HEVAE Framework advocates using five key criteria (Aquatic Ecosystems Task Group 20102a), NSW DCCEEW Water has adopted four criteria, diversity, distinctiveness, naturalness and vital habitat. Vital habitat data not able to be determined in the coastal HEVAE assessment due to lack of suitable data.  Lack of State-wide data prevented inclusion of the fifth criterion (representativeness). Each of the four criteria relies on state-wide or regional availability of instream value data, to enable the production of consistent spatial mapping outcomes. Mapping outputs were derived at the river reach scale and the overall HEVAE scores identify where the best instream values occur within a catchment. The overall riverine HEVAE outcomes can be examined to determine which particular individual values (e.g. a threatened fish species in the Distinctiveness criteria) are influencing the final HEVAE scores.\n\nThis <a href=\"https://publications.water.nsw.gov.au/watergroupjspui/bitstream/100/3706/1/applying-the-HEVAE-framework-for-riverine-ecosystems.pdf\">HEVAE report</a> provides the rationale and describes the methods adapted from the Commonwealth HEVAE Framework for instream value and for each of the four criteria used. Details are provided on the weightings used, and scoring approaches, providing the overall HEVAE scores for each river reach.\n\nThis dataset contains polyline features defining NSW freshwater riverine instream value. The dataset enables the inclusion of the most up-to-date instream value or asset information to inform water planning needs in NSW. It also spatially enables the identification of contemporary instream value data at the river reach scale, that can then inform water sharing rules at different scales required (e.g. management zone or surface water source), The dataset facilitates the generation of HEVAE outcomes to inform the risk assessment process and associated strategies in WSPs and WRPs, which are requirements under NSW legislation, as well as the Basin Plan.\n\n\n\nNote: If you would like to ask a question, make any suggestions, or tell us how you are using this dataset, please visit the <a href=\"https://water-hub.seed.nsw.gov.au/thread/search\">NSW Water Hub (within SEED) which has an online forum</a> you can join.",

After this time, Queensland Health moved to a quarterly reporting format for Elective Surgery and Emergency Department performance. This change was to align with the Queensland Health Hospital Performance site which supports greater consistency of other performance related activity across Hospital and Health Services. \n• Quarterly data from October 2020 can be found at https://www.data.qld.gov.au/dataset/emergency-departments-quarterly-data\n• There is a gap in data from March 2020 to September 2020 due to the national agreement to suspend public reporting of hospital performance. \n• As of July 2018 the Emergency Department dataset includes an additional 38 facilities. The 30 rural hospitals on the former Rural Emergency Department dataset have also been added to the Emergency Department dataset and will not be displayed on a separate page any more. As a result, the Emergency Department and Emergency Department Paediatrics datasets now display data for 97 facilities.\n• As of November 2018 the Emergency Department dataset includes Mount Morgan, Blackwater, Moura, Springsure and Woorabinda Hospitals.",

    "description": "The Mining (Strategic Prospectivity Zones) Act 1993 recognises the high mineral prospectivity of many areas of Tasmania.  Within the Strategic Prospectivity Zones (SPZ) there are restrictions on changes of the status of parcels of Crown Land.\nThe status of Crown land parcels &lt;500 ha in size can only be changed with the agreement of the Director of Mines; those of &gt; 500 ha in size cannot be changed without the approval of both houses of parliament.  Should a change in land status made by the State have the effect of revoking a mining lease or an exploration licence, the tenement holder is entitled to compensation. The State is, however, not responsible for actions of the Australian Government which may preclude exploration or mining. activity, such as the nomination of parcels of land for World Heritage status.\nChanges in status of land can also be made in extreme circumstances, for example if a species of flora or fauna was to become rare, vulnerable or endangered as a result of mining activity, or where an area having cultural or natural heritage value could suffer substantial effects as a result of mining operations. In these cases the Crown may, after a recommendation from the Resource Planning and Development Commission and some Ministers, change the status of that piece of land, and compensation is payable for this action.",

The template includes core properties of samples such as their name, identifier, type, and location, as well as associated metadata such as project, drilling contexts, hazard declaration and physical storage.\nThe template will be used to catalogue legacy and specimens systematically collected through mineral exploration projects. It has been developed iteratively, revised, and improved based on feedback from researchers and lab technicians. This standardized template can prevent duplicate sample metadata entry and lower metadata redundancy, thereby improving the program's physical sample curation and discovery.",

    "description": "We propose a study of pulsars with interpulse (IP) emissions using the Ultra-Wideband Low (UWL) receiver on the Parkes radio telescope (Murriyang). This project aims to investigate the polarization and emission properties of these pulsars through detailed modeling using the rotating vector model (RVM). Polarization profiles will be obtained over a wide frequency range, from 704 MHz to 4032 MHz. We will measure the emission height differences between the main pulse (MP) and IP as a function of frequency, allowing us to explore their frequency dependence and to test the radius-to-frequency mapping (RFM) model. Spectral analyses of individual profile components will be performed to constrain the emission properties and investigate differences between the MP and IP. Additionally, we will examine quasi-periodic microstructure in both MP and IP, aiming to characterize the microstructure period and explore its potential correlation with the magnetic inclination angle. This comprehensive investigation will yield new insights into the emission geometry of pulsars with IP emissions, contributing to a better understanding of their unique characteristics within the pulsar population.",

This census approach provides a comprehensive view of the APS and ensures no eligible respondents are omitted from the survey sample, removing sampling bias and reducing sample error. The census' content is designed to establish the views of APS employees on workplace issues such as leadership, learning and development and job satisfaction. The census ran from 9 May to 10 June 2016. Overall, 96,672 APS employees responded to the employee census, a response rate of 69%.\r\n\r\nPlease be aware that the very large number of respondents to the employee census means these files are over 200 mb in size.

    "description": "The record describes data collected from a summer deployment of an Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler (ADCP) moored in the central part of Jervis Bay, New South Wales (35o 05'S, 150o 44'E). An ADCP measures how fast water is moving across an entire water column. Anchored to the seafloor it can measure current speed not just at the bottom, but also at equal intervals all the way up to the surface. For this experiment, the ADCP was moored on the seabed, in a frame, with sensors looking upwards and approximately 0.5m above the seabed. \n\nOver the summer deployment, 13th December 1990 to 15th January 1991, the ADCP was set-up with a 15 minute sampling interval and currents were measured over 1m depth bins. Bin numbers and currents are referenced as a height above the seabed (due to the uncertainty in defining water depth because of tides and air pressure). As such Bin #1 is centered at 1.5m above the transducer face or 2.0m above the seabed. Bin #2 is centered at 3m above the seabed, Bin #3 at 4m and so on.  \n\nThree resources are provided: 1) A schematic of depth bin locations for the summer deployment, 2) Unfiltered east/west and north/south current values for every 15 minutes of the experiment, and 3) Low-pass filtered east/west and north/south hourly current values to remove tidal period motion. The filter has a half amplitude response at 32 hours and 48 hourly weights.\n\nThis child record relates to the parent, b146e140-2ae6-11dd-a735-00188b4c0af8. A pdf outlining the structure and hierarchy of all metadata records relating to this project is available to download through this record. Also available is a pdf of a published working paper documenting this experiment and the results.",

    "description": "Access APIMetadata Portal Metadata InformationContent TitleBega Valley Road Segment 3D May 2024Content TypeScene Layer/Scene Layer PackageDescriptionNSW Transport Theme Road Segment is a line feature class representing a section of road having common attributes and terminating at its physical and or at an intersection with another road at the same grade (same level). Its position is determined by the methodology used to input into the Topographic Database. Common methods of input include GPS, traced from the cadastre or traced from an orthorectified image.Data included in Road Segments includes:Vehicular TrackPathwayContinuity LineStandard Road&nbsp;On-off RampDual CarriagewayInitial Publication Date01/05/2024Data Currency01/05/2024Data Update FrequencyOtherContent SourceData provider filesFile TypeScene Layer Package (*.slpk)AttributionData Theme, Classification or Relationship to other DatasetsTransport Theme of the NSW Foundation Spatial Data FrameworkAccuracyThe dataset maintains a positional relationship to, and alignment with, the Lot and Property digital datasets. The Lot and Property data was captured by digitising the best available cadastral mapping at a variety of scales and accuracies, ranging from 1:500 to 1:250 000 according to the National Mapping Council of Australia, Standards of Map Accuracy (1975). Therefore, the position of the feature instance will be within 0.5mm at the map scale for 90% of the well-defined points. That is 1:500 = 0.25m, 1:2000 = 1m, 1:4000 = 2m, 1:25000 = 12.5m, 1:50000 = 25m and 1:00000 = 50m. A program of positional upgrade (accuracy improvement) is currently underway. Feature heights have been derived from LiDAR elevation sources including 1m and 2m DEMS. The data used to create the DEMs have an accuracy of 0.3m (95% Confidence Interval) vertical and 0.8m (95% Confidence Interval) horizontal. The features vertical accuracy is also a function of its horizon.Spatial Reference System (dataset)WGS84Spatial Reference System (web service)EPSG:4326WGS84 Equivalent ToGDA2020Spatial ExtentContent LineageData ClassificationUnclassifiedData Access PolicyOpenData QualityTerms and ConditionsCreative CommonStandard and SpecificationData CustodianSpatial Services | Department of Customer ServicesPoint of ContactSS-SDS@customerservice.nsw.gov.auData AggregatorSpatial Services | Department of Customer ServicesData DistributorSpatial Services | Department of Customer ServicesAdditional Supporting InformationOpen Geospatial Consortium (OGC) implemented and compatible for the consumption by common GIS platforms.

    "description": "Version Oct 2021 (To be notified of mapping changes and updates please subscribe to PD News)(Overlay Dataset 1 of 4, needs to be used in conjunction with riparian waterways and North Lakes Locality and Caboolture West Local Plan area datasets).The Environmental Areas Overlay is part of the Moreton Bay Regional Council Planning Scheme. MBRC Planning Scheme will help to respond to growth and development across the Moreton Bay Region. It is a statutory document regulating how land can be used and developed. The MBRC planning scheme replaces the three previous planning schemes created by the former Caboolture, Pine Rivers and Redcliffe councils.Planning schemes use overlays to show the location and extent of special features that need to be considered, such as where land may be subject to hazards or other characteristics. Overlay maps may apply to all or part of your property and your property may be affected by more than one overlay. Having an overlay on your property will only affect you if you intend to develop (i.e. extent or build, change use, subdivide, clear native vegetation, fill or excavate).  For more information refer to the values and constraints criteria in the relevant code in the planning scheme, see a range of helpful information sheets or contact Council.  The attribute fields are defined as per Qld Planning Provisions, Schedule 2. The Queensland Planning Provisions (QPP) are the standard planning scheme provisions made by the Minister for Planning under Chapter 2, Part 5, Division 2 and Chapter 2, Part 6 of the Sustainable Planning Act 2009. Further details on the Qld Planning Provisions can be found here. ",

    "description": "Transport for NSW provides projections of population and dwellings at the small area (Travel Zone or TZ) level for NSW. The latest version is Travel Zone Projections 2024 (TZP24), released in January 2025.\nTZP24 replaces the previously published TZP22.\nThe projections are developed to support a strategic view of NSW and are aligned with the NSW Government Common Planning Assumptions.\nThe TZP24 Population &amp; Dwellings Projections dataset covers the following variables:\n\n\nEstimated Resident Population\n\n\nStructural Private Dwellings (Regional NSW only)\n\n\nPopulation in Occupied Private Dwellings, by 5-year Age categories &amp; by Sex\n\n\nPopulation in Non-Private Dwellings\n\n\nThe projections in this release, TZP24, are presented annually from 2021 to 2031 and 5-yearly from 2031 to 2066, and are in TZ21 geography.\nPlease note, TZP24 is based on best available data as at early 2024, and the projections incorporate results of the National Census conducted by the ABS in August 2021.\nKey Data Inputs used in TZP24:\n\n\n2024 NSW Population Projections – NSW Department of Planning, Housing &amp; Infrastructure\n\n\n2021 Census data - Australian Bureau of Statistics (including dwellings by occupancy, total dwellings by Mesh Block, household sizes, private dwellings by occupancy, population age and gender, persons by place of usual residence)\n\n\nFor a summary of the TZP24 projection method please refer to the TZP24 Factsheet.\nFor more detail on the projection process please refer to the TZP24 Technical Guide. \nAdditional land use information for workforce and employment as well as Travel Zone 2021 boundaries for NSW (TZ21) and concordance files are also available for download on the Open Data Hub.\nVisualisations of the population projections are available on the Transport for NSW Website under Data and research/Reference Information.\nCautions\nThe TZP24 dataset represents one view of the future aligned with the NSW Government Common Planning Assumptions and population and employment projections.\nThe projections are not based on specific assumptions about future new transport infrastructure but do take into account known land-use developments underway or planned, and strategic plans.\n\n\nTZP24 is a strategic state-wide dataset and caution should be exercised when considering results at detailed breakdowns.\n\n\nThe TZP24 outputs represent a point in time set of projections (as at early 2024).\n\n\nThe projections are not government targets.\n\n\nTravel Zone (TZ) level outputs are projections only and should be used as a guide. As with all small area data, aggregating of travel zone projections to higher geographies leads to more robust results.\n\n\nAs a general rule, TZ-level projections are illustrative of a possible future only.\n\n\nMore specific advice about data reliability for the specific variables projected is provided in the “Read Me” page of the Excel format summary spreadsheets on the TfNSW Open Data Hub.\n\n\nCaution is advised when comparing TZP24 with the previous set of projections (TZP22) due to addition of new data sources for the most recent years, and adjustments to methodology.\n\n\nFurther cautions and notes can be found in the TZP24 Technical Guide\nImportant note: \nThe Department of Planning, Housing &amp; Infrastructure (DPHI) published the 2024 NSW Population Projections in November 2024. As per DPHI’s published projections, the following variables are excluded from the published TZP24 Population and Dwellings Projections:\n\n\nStructural Private Dwellings for Travel Zones in 43 councils across Greater Sydney, Illawarra-Shoalhaven, Central Coast, Lower Hunter and Greater Newcastle\n\n\nOccupied Private Dwellings for Travel Zones in NSW.\n\n\nFurthermore, in TZP24, the Structural Private Dwellings variable aligns with the 2024 Implied Dwelling projections while the Occupied Private Dwellings variable aligns with the 2024 Households projections at SA2 level prepared by DPHI.\nThe above variables are available upon request by contacting model.selection@transport.nsw.gov.au - Attention Place Forecasting.",

    "description": "This data was collected in January and February 2010 by the IMOS Ship of Opportunity Underway CO2 Measurement research group on RV Southern Surveyor (IMOS platform code: VLHJ) voyage SS012010.\n\nDeparted:  Sydney, Australia, January 22, 2010\nArrived:  \t Hobart, Australia, February 15, 2010\n\nCO2 System Overview:\nThe fugacity of carbon dioxide (fCO2) in surface seawater was measured using a General Oceanics Inc. automated system (Model 8050; Pierrot et al 2009). Seawater is sprayed into an equilibration chamber and CO2 in the headspace gas equilibrates with the seawater. The headspace gas is pumped through a thermoelectric condenser followed by a nafion drying tube before flowing through a Licor 7000 non-dispersive infrared gas analyser used to measure the CO2 mole fraction (XCO2) of the dried air. The gas flow is stopped temporarily for the CO2 measurements, which are made at atmospheric pressure. A set of four CO2 standards that cover the range of CO2 values expected in the ocean are analysed about every four hours to calibrate the gas analyser. The standard gas concentrations are on the WMO-X2007 mole fraction scale for CO2-in-air. Atmospheric XCO2 (dry) is measured after the standards by pumping clean outside air from an intake on the forward mast of the ship. \n\nSeawater intake and ancillary data:\nThe seawater intake is located at about 5.5m depth in the bow of the ship. Sea surface salinity is measured using a thermosalinograph (Seabird Electronics SBE21) located next to the CO2 system. A remote temperature sensor (Seabird Electronics SBE 38) located at the intake is used to measure sea surface temperature (SST). The travel time between the intake and CO2 system is typically about 4 minutes with warming usually less than 0.6ºC. The thermosalinograph water is from the same intake, but the supply lines separate after the intake. A comparison of thermosalinograph and equilibrator temperature records shows the temperature difference in the two lines is generally less than 0.1ºC. The thermosalinograph water line travels outside the ship and is typically warmer than the equilibrator. The travel time in water line to the thermosalinograph is 2.5 minutes faster than to the equilibrator. \n\nMeteorological data, salinity, SST, and ships position and time are taken from the ships logging system. These parameters and the data quality are maintained by the Australian Marine National Facility.",

The site is several hundred metres inland of 50m high cliffs and is 63m above sea-level.\n\nThis record provides wind statistics for August 1989. Five datasets are included here representing different times of the day: 0000-0550, 0600-1150, 1200-1750 and 1800-2350. Individual measurements have been converted so that trends of wind speed and direction can be seen for the time period in question. The fifth dataset incorporates all the wind data collected irrespective of time providing a monthly summary. The station initially recorded wind data at 10 minute intervals.\n\nThis is one of thirty-six child records that relate to the parent, 629051e0-2b7b-11dd-a343-00188b4c0af8.

The Future Reef MAP project is funded by Rio Tinto Alcan and administered by the Great Barrier Reef Foundation, with an equal co-investment by CSIRO. The project is the first large-scale CO2 observing system established on the Great Barrier Reef using the Rio Tinto ship, RTM Wakmatha. The research is targeted at providing information on the CO2 uptake and the controls on ocean acidification change in the region. It is providing foundation data needed to assess the vulnerability of the GBR reefs to ocean acidification. This dataset contains quality controlled underway measurements of the fugacity of CO2, atmospheric pressure, and sea surface temperature and salinity. The data management and distribution of these data were supported by the CSIRO Carbon Collaboration Cluster and the Australian Coastal Ecosystem Facility.",

    "description": "This data identifies the maximum floor space ratio (FSR) for a building on certain land. The floor space ratio of buildings on a site is the ratio of the gross floor area of all buildings within the site to the site area. Clause 4.4 deals with the calculation of floor space ratio and site area. The maximum floor space ratio for a building may be subject to certain exceptions under other provisions of the Local Environment Plan (LEP). The FSR dataset defines the maximum allowed floor space ratio for individual properties, or how much floor area can be built on that property. FSR is the ratio of a building's floor area to the size of land that the building sits on, and is calculated by dividing the total floor area of a building by the total land area of the property (known as the site area). The original GIS data was captured by local councils, DP&amp;I and contractors and provided in accordance with the DP&amp;I's Standard Requirements for GIS LEP data and Standard Technical Requirements for LEP maps. Before the LEP is notified on the NSW Legislation website, the mapping is checked by DP&amp;I and the Parliamentary Council's Office to ensure that it is consistent with these standards. After the LEP is notified, the GIS data is quality controlled using an ISO 9001-Quality-Certified, Quality Management System and incorporated into the Statewide dataset. The Floor Space Ratio data relates directly to and adopts the accuracy of its reference dataset, Land and Property Information DCDB.\n The GIS data may be subject to change as a part of quality control, or if the LEP is amended. Please confirm dates of respective features before use as this dataset has a large temporal extent.",

    "description": "This dataset presents the footprint of the rates of Victorian domestic/family/sexual violence patients retrieved from Ambulance Victoria. The data spans the reference period of June 2016 to June 2018 and is aggregated to 2011 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS) Local Government Areas (LGA).\nThe Victorian Family Violence Database is a repository for a range of different datasets relating to family violence clients and service use, extracted from the data holdings of a variety of government agencies.\nThe rate of patients per 100,000 population is calculated using the count of events occurring within a LGA and the Estimated Resident Population (ERP) of that LGA. The rate is calculated using the following formula: Rate per 100,000 = (Number of events/ERP count) x 100,000. ERPs are based on populations provided by the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS).\nFor further information about this dataset and related statistics, visit the data source:Crime Statistics Australia.\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data.\n\n\nData concerning family violence and sexual violence cannot easily be disaggregated. The data includes events of sexual violence by a non-familial perpetrator.\n\n\nThe data used in these data tables count the number of records provided by Ambulance Victoria. This translates to the number of patients (non-unique) who were the subject of an event which involved Ambulance Victoria attendance.\n\n\nTo maintain confidentiality, person-based counts with a value of 3 or less are given a value of 2 to calculate totals.\n\n",

    "description": "This dataset presents information and locations related to The Super Tuesday Bike Count event in Alice Springs for 2019. The counts are presented as individual points which relate to the location where the counts were undertaken by volunteers.\nThe Super Tuesday Bike Count collects annual figures of bicycle riders and their movements on roads and bike paths. Since 2007, Bicycle Network has conducted bicycle counts at key intersections and corridors selected by local governments. The data is available for researchers and policymakers to plan and build cycling infrastructure to promote increased cycling activity, and to gather longitudinal insights of cycling volumes and trends.\nSuper Tuesday count data is collected visually by volunteer counters at intersections along popular commuter routes, as well as subsidiary routes with lower rider volumes. The count is conducted in southern states (VIC, NSW, SA, WA) between 7:00-9:00am on the first Tuesday of March; and in northern states (QLD, NT) between 6:30-8:30am on the first Tuesday of September. Count locations are nominated by traffic engineers, transport planners, and other transport officers from participating councils. Counters record all movement directions, rider gender, and bicycle volume per fifteen-minute increments on standardised count sheets. \nFor more information please visit the Norther Territory Government Open Data Portal or view the Bicycle Network Super Tuesday Count Report.\nPlease note: \n\nWhere there was no data available (\"no data\", \"NA\", \"#N/A\" in the original data) the values have been set to NULL.\n",

    "description": "This dataset presents the footprint of the age-standardised percentage of adults who are overweight. Adults were classified as overweight if their Body Mass Index (BMI) was greater than or equal to 25 and less than 30. As an indication of the accuracy of estimates, 95% confidence intervals were produced. These were calculated by the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) using standard error estimates of the proportion. The data spans the financial year of 2014-2015 and is aggregated to 2015 Department of Health Primary Health Network (PHN) areas, based on the 2011 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nHealth risk factors are attributes, characteristics or exposures that increase the likelihood of a person developing a disease or health disorder. Examples of health risk factors include risky alcohol consumption, physical inactivity and high blood pressure. High-quality information on health risk factors is important in providing an evidence base to inform health policy, program and service delivery.\nFor further information about this dataset, visit the data source: Australian Institute of Health and Welfare - Health Risk Factors in 2014-2015 Data Tables.\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data using the Department of Health - PHN Areas.\n\n\nAge-standardisation is a method of removing the influence of age when comparing populations with different age structures - either different populations at the same time or the same population at different times. For this data the Australian estimated resident population of people aged 18 and over as at 30 June 2001 has been used as the standard population.\n\n\nAdults are defined as persons aged 18 years and over.\n\n\nData for PHN701 (Northern Territory) should be interpreted with caution as the National Health Survey excluded discrete Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities and very remote areas, which comprise around 28% of the estimated resident population of the Northern Territory living in private dwellings.\n\n",

Brisbane City Council monitors of enterococci bi-monthly in summer and monthly during the cooler winter months. The presence of high levels of enterococci can vary daily, and may be elevated after heavy rainfall. Enterococci exposure can contribute to increased health risk and primary contact should be avoided.\n\nThe Data and resources section of this dataset contains further information for this dataset.",

Using a 4-tiered hierarchical classification, the datasets show where land is owned, leased, reserved or unallocated to a defined purpose in Australia. The datasets were constructed by combining jurisdictional land title information from digital cadastral databases or their equivalents with Indigenous land grant instruments areas. The data package contains for each of the 3 time periods an independent raster and data caveat raster of known uncertainties in the product, plus 4 combined change rasters. The 5-yearly data is at a resolution of 250 by 250 metres.\r\nThe Land tenure of Australia 2010–11 to 2020–21 data package is a product of the Australian Collaborative Land Use and Management Program. This data package replaces the Land tenure of Australia 2010–11 to 2015–16 data package, with updates to these time periods.",

    "description": "The Friends of Bool and Hacks Lagoon group and BirdLife Australia provided Lynker Analytics with aerial photography for the Bools and Hacks lagoon. The imagery consisted of 66 ECW files which covered the Bool lagoon at a resolution of 0.106m. In addition to the imagery, twenty-seven ground truth points were also provided to assist in the correct annotation of the eight target classes.\nLynker then manually annotated these images into a polyline annotation dataset. The classes followed by their class id are:\n• Tussock 1\n• Tree 2\n• Sedge 3\n• Reed 4\n• Grasses 5\n• Open Water 6\n• Ground 7\n• Aquatic Floating 8\nLynker used a machine learning training process called supervised learning, whereby a machine learning model is trained using example image and annotation pairs to learn the same decision outcomes on new or previously unseen images.\nMachine Learning is notoriously data-hungry and model accuracy is sensitive to the quality and quantity of input data. An annotation process that used polylines to quickly develop a large dataset of positively annotated pixels was used to develop the dataset of target classes to train the supervised model.\n\nThe model’s performance on holdout data was shown to have a classification accuracy of 0.965 and mean F1 score also of 0.965. Sedge was the lowest performing class often instead being predicted to be grasses or ground. The aquatic floating class was the highest performing class in the holdout set, every pixel of this class in the holdout set was correctly predicted and no other classes were incorrectly predicted to belong to the aquatic floating class.\n\nSee raw imagery here: https://data.sa.gov.au/data/dataset/a908a10b-b3c0-40e2-a2f9-0ed3849579c7",

    "description": "Map notes:North Esk &amp; Tamar Flood Water Surface ProfilesFor use in Planning GeneralThese maps indicate North Esk derived flood levels from the Black Bridge to Corra Linn. The maximum flood levels below Hobblers Bridge and in the Tamar are determined by South Esk discharges into the Tamar which provide higher elevations than the North Esk discharges for the same Average Recurrence Interval (ARI).This map is primarily intended for use in planning to that end it includes:A 100 year ARI profile with current sea level conditionsA 100 year ARI profile with 800mm rise in sea levelA 200 year ARI profileDischargesHydro Consulting was commissioned to review the South Esk hydrology while the North Esk hydrology was derived by the University of New South Wales Water Research laboratory. The Table 1 indicates the results of latter study used in the construction of this map.Flood Return Period in Years ARINorth Esk Flood Discharges (UNSW WRL 2006)South Esk Discharges (Hydro Consulting 2008)1034514302041918105052623301006142910200710(Monte Carlo Range)1850 3430 39905008514630Table 1The adopted tail-water level used in the North Esk analysis for this map was 2.1 m AHD at the junction with the Tamar for all discharges. This represents the highest astronomical tide at Launceston with average atmospheric pressure and neutral wind conditions. The North Esk model was successfully calibrated to the flood which occurred on 30thAugust 2005 which peaked at 470 cumecs and the flood which occurred on 21stJune 2011 at 251 cumecs.",

Two time periods are provided in the south west agricultural zone only where the Land Monitor index can be more confidently applied, these time periods are 1990-current year and the last 10 years. The summaries are statistical measures of mean, linear trend over time, quadratic trend over time, standard deviation about mean, residual standard deviation after fitting linear trend and residual standard deviation after fitting linear and quadratic trends. The statistical summaries can be displayed separately or together to summarise trends and stability of vegetation over time as measured by the Land Monitor vegetation index, and in particular to highlight areas with different patterns of change.\n\nClick <a href=\"https://data.wa.gov.au/land-monitor\">here</a> for more information.",

This flood has a 50% chance of being experienced at least once in a person's lifetime. The 1 in 100 AEP flood has been generally adopted in Australia and overseas as the basis for floodplain management planning.\n</li>\n<li>\n\nFloodplain - the portion of a river valley next to the river channel which is covered with water when the river overflows its banks during major river flows. The term also applies to land adjacent to estuaries which is subject to flooding.\n</li>\n<li>\n\nDesignated flood event (DFE) - used for planning purposes and is generally the 1 in 100 (1%) AEP \"designed\" flood event. However, a designated flood event could be based on an \"actual\" flood event (e.g. Moora 1999 flood event) or an alternative scenario (i.e. Yakamia Creek - 1 in 100 (1%) AEP flood event plus sea level rise).\n</li>\n<li>\n\nMaximum channel capacity (MCC) - the maximum flow that a waterway can contain before breaking out across the floodplain during a flood event. \n</li>\n<li>\n\nProbable maximum flood (PMF) - the largest flood that could conceivably occur at a particular location, resulting from probable maximum precipitation. The PMF defines the extent of flood-prone land. Generally, it is not physically or financially possible to provide general protection against this event.\n</li>\n<li>\n\nAustralian Height Datum (AHD) - is a geodetic datum for altitude measurement in Australia. It was adopted in 1971 by the National Mapping Council as the datum to which all vertical control for mapping is to be referred. The datum is based on the mean sea level (1966-1968) being assigned the value 0.000m on the Australian Height Datum (AHD) at 30 tide gauges around the coast of the Australian continent.\n</li>\n</ul>",

    "description": "In colonial organisms, physical damage or predation can result in the loss of part of the colony.  Although the colony may survive, the loss of part of the colony may alter patterns of growth and reproduction.  In this study, the response of Bugula neritina, an arborescent bryozoan, to physical damage was tested in three experiments: 1) short term regenerative responses to the removal of zooids from growth tips; ii) growth and reproductive responses to damage imposed at different locations within the colony; and iii) the effects of damage produced by a natural predator, the nudibranch Polycera hedgepethi. This dataset gives the growth response of immature colonies over two weeks following the removal of zooids from growth tips of branches from one side of a colony; the remaining side of the colony was left intact. Immature colonies which had undergone four branching events were used in the experiment.  After damage was imposed, colonies were returned to the field site at Williamstown, Victoria.  Colony size (branching score) and the proportion of branches with budding tips were measured on damaged and intact sides of each colony for three weeks between January and February 2000.  Branch tips resumed budding within a few days of damage being imposed and the proportion of budding tips on the damaged sides of the colonies did not differ from intact sides after two weeks.  Damaged sides of colonies were smaller than intact sides two weeks after injury but growth rates were similar by day seven.",

    "description": "Fixed cameras installed at TERN Robson Creek Rainforest SuperSite provide a time series of fine scale data as a long-term record of vegetation structure and condition. This dense time series of phenocam images provides data for analysis of ecological responses to climate variability, and when consolidated across the entire terrestrial ecosystem research network, supports calibration and validation of satellite-derived remote sensing data, ensuring delivery of higher quality results for broader scale environmental monitoring products.   \n\n\nImages are captured half hourly during daylight hours. Images and data products, including timeseries of the Green Chromatic Coordinate (Gcc) for a region-of-interest (ROI) that delineates an area of specific vegetation type, are made available on an almost real-time basis.\n\n\nThe 25 hectare site lies on the Atherton Tablelands in the wet tropical rainforests of Australia at 680-740 m elevation. It is situated in Danbulla National Park within the Wet Tropics World Heritage Area. The forest is classified as Regional Ecosystem (RE) 7.3.36a, complex mesophyll vine forest. The climate is seasonal with approximately 60% of rain falling between January and March and the landform is moderately inclined with a low relief. There are 208 species in the site, and average canopy height is 28 m, ranging from 23 to 44 m. All stems ≥ 10 cm diameter are measured, tagged and mapped. For additional site information, see https://www.tern.org.au/tern-observatory/tern-ecosystem-processes/robson-creek-rainforest-supersite/. \n\n\nOther images collected at the site include photopoints, digital cover photography (DCP) and ancillary images of fauna and flora.",

    "description": "Foliage Projective Cover (FPC) is the percentage of ground area occupied by the vertical projection of foliage. The Remote Sensing Centre FPC mapping is based on an automated decision tree classification technique applied to dry season (May to October) Landsat-5 TM, Landsat-7 ETM  and Landsat-8 OLI imagery for the period 1988-2013. The wooded extent product has a nominal accuracy of 85%. The field data used to calibrate the imagery/FPC relationship was mostly collected over the period 1996-1999. Corrections have been applied to remove errors due to topographic effects, cloud, cloud shadow, water, cropping, and regrowth following clearing. Some errors may remain. The product was generated from WRS-2 path/row scenes obtained from the United States Geological Survey (USGS). While some land cover change may be detected in the FPC processing, this product is not designed to generate clearing or regrowth following clearing layers, and should not be used to assess clearing or be compared with previous years for change monitoring. The Statewide Landcover and Trees Study (SLATS) produces accurate clearing layers for this purpose.",

    "title": "Population dynamics of the infaunal bivalve, Soletellina alba",
    "description": "The population dynamics of the infaunal bivalve Soletellina alba were investigated at three sites situated in close proximity to the mouth of the Hopkins River estuary from 1997 to 1999. The distribution and abundance of juvenile and adult S.alba was very variable across all dates, sites and channel elevations (i.e. water depths). An experimental test comparing the recruitment of juveniles at different channel elevations and in sediments of varying particle size was conducted  during 1999. The results of these tests showed that recruitment was greatest at the shallowest channel elevation and there was little evidence that sediment particle size influenced recruitment. In contrast to 1999, recruitment during 1997 or 1998 was very low.\n\nGrowth rates were monitored using tagged individuals held in caged and uncaged plots, which revealed that growth was highly variable among individuals, but not between sites. These tests also revealed that growth was negligible during the colder, winter months, and that the fastest growing individuals were capable of growing 0.2 mm/day.\n\nSalinity tolerance experiments showed that bivalves exposed to low salinities (< 6 ppt), exhibited poorer condition and took longer to re-burrow into sediments than those exposed to greater salinities (> 14 ppt), while death of bivalves exposed to salinities < 1 ppt occurred after 8 days of exposure. These tests provide evidence that low salinities are probably the principal cause of mass mortalities that are observed during winter flooding, although the interaction between salinity, temperature and turbidity also deserve consideration in the future. \n\nIt is hypothesised that the survival of very young juveniles (between 0.5mm and 1mm shell length) and rapid growth rates are important features of the life history of S.alba that explain its successful persistence within the Hopkins River estuary. It is highly likely that this species is capable of completing its entire life cycle within the estuary. The absence of other nearby populations, and periods of mouth closure, are likely to greatly limit the potential contribution made by larvae entering from the surrounding marine environment. This study has added to our knowledge of how an infaunal bivalve copes with life in the intermittently closing estuaries that typify semi-arid coastlines in the Southern Hemisphere.",

Enrolments are full-time equivalent (FTE). For the purposes of reporting, only students in Year 11 and 12 may be part-time. Hence there is no difference between \"full-time\" and \"full-time equivalent\" enrolments for K-10 or ungraded in NSW government schools. Ungraded students are students who are not assigned to a particular grade. These students are often enrolled in support classes or schools for specific purposes (SSPs). If a school has FTE enrolments greater than 5 for all its grades, then the grade-level FTE data is published. If a schools has FTE enrolments equal to or less than 5, the grade-level FTE data is suppressed and school level FTE data is only published. Where only one grade at a school had a value of &lt;=5, the ungraded cell has also been suppressed for privacy reasons. Where there are no ungraded students, the grade with the next lowest total is also suppressed.\nSchool location information obtained from the NSW Department of Education Master Dataset, 14 December 2017 release.\nFor more information visit https://data.cese.nsw.gov.au/data/dataset/full-time-equivalent-fte-enrolments-by-individual-nsw-government-schools-and-calendar-year.",

    "description": "Overview  \r\nAustralia's plantation log supply 2015-2059 report presents forecasts of sawlog and pulplog volumes available from softwood and hardwood plantations. Changes in log availability have important implications for Australia's rural economies; the size, type and geographical location of wood and paper product manufacturing industries; the national supply of wood products; Australia's trade balance; and Australia's export income. \r\n\r\n This report has been prepared by ABARES under the auspices of the National Plantation Inventory--a program that has collected data and reported on plantations established primarily for wood production in Australia since 1993. Comprehensive plantation log availability forecast reports are published every five years and Australia's plantation log supply 2015-2059 is the fifth log supply report. \r\n\r\n In this report, forecasts are presented for softwood and hardwood sawlog and pulplog volumes by National Plantation Inventory region, based on the combination of forecasts supplied by plantation owners and managers through a survey and ABARES modelled forecasts. For the modelled forecasts, ABARES did not account for any future changes in social, economic or environmental parameters. \r\n\r\n Key Points  \r\n• The potential log availability from Australia's commercial plantation estate is forecast to increase to an annual average of 29.7 million cubic metres in the 2015-19 period, followed by a decline to an annual average of 27.0 million cubic metres a year for the 2020-24 period. The 2015 to 2059 average total plantation log availability forecast is 10 per cent lower in this report, compared with the 2012 log supply report; the average hardwood log availability forecast is 21 per cent lower and the average softwood log availability forecast is 2 per cent lower. \r\n• The majority of the decline in total log availability is because the expected yield from hardwood plantations is forecast to decline as plantations of low commerciality are not replanted and some lease agreements with landholders are not renewed. \r\n• ABARES estimates that the total commercial plantation estate may decrease by around 80 000 to 100 000 hectares over the next 10 to 15 years as new plantation establishment will not be sufficient to offset removals of low commerciality plantations unless there are new drivers to expand or maintain the current plantation estate. \r\n",

    "description": "This data is a combination of records held by the Australian Maritime Safety Authority.  From 1999 to 2011 Australia shipping was tracked through the Australian Ship Reporting System (AUSREP). From 2012 onward this changed to the Automatic Identification System (AIS). The data presented here are summaries of the tracks of vessels between the points identified by either AUSREP or AIS, summarised to the number of KM per 0.1 deg grid square.\n\nThe AIS is a Very High Frequency (VHF) radio broadcasting system which enables AIS equipped vessels and shore-based stations to send and receive identifying information.\n\nThis information can:\n\nbe displayed on a computer or chart plotter\naid in situational awareness\nprovide a means to assist in collision avoidance.\n\nThe International Maritime Organization (IMO) defines AIS as a ship and shore based broadcast system, operating in the VHF maritime band.\n\nThe AIS can handle over 2,000 reports per minute and may update information as often as every two seconds.\n\nhttps://www.amsa.gov.au/navigation/services/ais/\n\nAustralian Ship Reporting System (AUSREP) is a ship reporting system designed to contribute to the safety of life at sea and is operated by the Australian Maritime Safety Authority (AMSA) through the Australian Rescue Coordination Centre (RCC Australia) in Canberra. Participation in AUSREP is mandatory for certain ships but most other commercial ships participate voluntarily. Shipmasters send a position report each day at a convenient time nominated by the ship, the maximum time between any two reports is not to exceed 24 hours. The data is used as reference material only, designed to indicate shipping lanes and the number of vessels moving through Australian waters. AUSREP commenced in 1973 in line with Australia's obligations under the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea (SOLAS) as a ship reporting system and is operated by AMSA through the RCC Australia in Canberra.\n\nhttps://www.operations.amsa.gov.au/Spatial/DataServices/MapProduct",

During a visit to Alice Springs in July of this year information on these deposits was obtained from the Resident Geologists, A.D.M. Bell, and it is considered that potentially they may be of considerable importance and Bell has been instructed to investigate them further. The deposits are briefly discussed in the monthly report by Bell dated 3rd July, 1953. In this report he states that the rocks to the west of Alice Springs, where limestones are developed only on a comparatively small scale, are not likely to contain ore deposits to the extent of those to the east of Alice Springs where extensive limestone deposits occur. This concept is discussed below. [A supplementary note is enclosed which describes an inspection of the area which was conducted in September 1953].",

The Lot and Property data was captured by digitising the best available cadastral mapping at a variety of scales and accuracies, ranging from 1:500 to 1:250 000 according to the National Mapping Council of Australia, Standards of Map Accuracy (1975). Therefore, the position of the feature instance will be within 0.5mm at the map scale for 90% of the well-defined points. That is 1:500 = 0.25m, 1:2000 = 1m, 1:4000 = 2m, 1:25000 = 12.5m, 1:50000 = 25m and 1:00000 = 50m. A program of positional upgrade (accuracy improvement) is currently underway. Feature heights have been derived from LiDAR elevation sources including 1m and 2m DEMS. The data used to create the DEMs have an accuracy of 0.3m (95% Confidence Interval) vertical and 0.8m (95% Confidence Interval) horizontal. The features vertical accuracy is also a function of its horizon.Spatial Reference System (dataset)WGS84Spatial Reference System (web service)EPSG:4326WGS84 Equivalent ToGDA2020Spatial ExtentContent LineageData ClassificationUnclassifiedData Access PolicyOpenData QualityTerms and ConditionsCreative CommonStandard and SpecificationData CustodianSpatial Services | Department of Customer ServicesPoint of ContactSS-SDS@customerservice.nsw.gov.auData AggregatorSpatial Services | Department of Customer ServicesData DistributorSpatial Services | Department of Customer ServicesAdditional Supporting InformationOpen Geospatial Consortium (OGC) implemented and compatible for the consumption by common GIS platforms.

The objectives of the survey was to study deep water marine habitats and to assess the petroleum potential of the Mentelle Basin. The swath data collected covered a new area of seabed that revealed the extents of the blind submarine canyons and completed the coverage of the Perth Canyon and filled the remaining gaps with high resolution swath bathymetry data.\n\nThis dataset is not to be used for navigational purposes.",
