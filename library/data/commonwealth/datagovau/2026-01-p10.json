The boundaries used for the dataset follow the 2018 edition of the Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nSmall Area Labour Markets presents regional estimates of unemployment and the unemployment rate at two small area levels:\n\n\nFor approximately 2,100 Australian Bureau of Statistics’ (ABS) Statistical Area Level 2s (SA2s), on a State/Territory and Metropolitan/Non-metropolitan basis; and\n\n\nFor each of Australia’s 540 Local Government Areas (LGAs).\n\n\nThe estimates in Table 1 and 2 are smoothed using a four-quarter average to minimise the variability inherent in small area estimates. A description of the methodology used to prepare the estimates in this publication is presented in the Explanatory Notes, as well as on page 43 of the PDF Publication.\nPlease note: \n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data.\n\n\nWhere data values were \"-\" (no data provided) in the original data they have been set to null.\n\n\nCaution: Highly disaggregated estimates of unemployment and the unemployment rate at the SA2 and LGA level can display significant variability and should be viewed with caution. Indeed, quarter-to-quarter comparisons may not be indicative of actual movements in the labour market. It is therefore recommended that year-on-year comparisons be used.\n\n",

    "description": "Data describes habitat suitability modelling (HSM) results for macroinvertebrates in streams. The data was developed by University of Melbourne through the Melbourne Waterways Research Practice Partnership as part of the development of Melbourne Water’s Healthy Waterways Strategy 2018 (HWS2018). Analysis has been undertaken across the Melbourne Water operating region, where the operating region has been divided into 16,346 sub-catchments. Of these 16,346 subcatchments, 8233 contain Melbourne Water waterways. The results are presented for each of these 8233 reaches. The data was used to estimate the scores for macroninvertebrates presented in the HWS for three scenarios:Current: habitat suitability under current conditions (i.e. 2014).Current trajectory: habitat suitability under urbanisation and climate change scenarios if current management approaches continue.Target trajectory: habitat suitability given urbanisation and climate change (as for current trajectory), together with (a) delivery of performance objectives of the Healthy Waterways Strategy and (b) achievement of environmental condition scores as described in the Catchment Programs of the Healthy Waterways Strategy.Data has also been captured for a range of modelled HSM scenarios involving revegetation, stormwater management and climate change. Primary purpose is for waterways planning and analysis.Habitat Suitability Model results have been thoroughly reviewed and are considered fit for purpose (i.e. for waterway planning). This data set covers the entire Melbourne Water region with the exception of very small areas close to Port Phillip Bay or Western Port. For example, there are small areas of French Island which are not captured.This data set was created using: 1. Streams dataset for the Healthy Waterways Strategy 2018. This layer was developed by GraceGIS using Melbourne Water layers as inputs. 2. Results from Habitat Suitability Modelling for the Healthy Waterways Strategy 2018. Further reading: Chee et al.

    "description": "This data release consists of flux tower measurements of the exchange of energy and mass between the surface and the atmospheric boundary-layer in semi-arid eucalypt woodland using eddy covariance techniques. It been processed using PyFluxPro (v3.3.3) as described in Isaac et al. (2017), <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-14-2903-2017\">https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-14-2903-2017</a>. PyFluxPro takes data recorded at the flux tower and process this data to a final, gap-filled product with Net Ecosystem Exchange (NEE) partitioned into Gross Primary Productivity (GPP) and Ecosystem Respiration (ER). For more information about the processing levels, see <a href=\"https://github.com/OzFlux/PyFluxPro/wiki\">https://github.com/OzFlux/PyFluxPro/wiki</a>.\n   \nThe Cow Bay flux station was established in December 2008 and managed by James Cook University. The forest is classified as complex mesophyll vine forest, there are 94 species in the core 1Ha, and average tree height is 22m. Elevation of the site is 90m and mean annual precipitation is 3935mm. The Daintree Rainforest is one of the most biodiverse forests in Australia.The instruments are mounted on a walk-up tourist tower at 35m. Fluxes of heat, water vapour and carbon dioxide are measured using the open-path eddy flux technique. Supplementary measurements above the canopy include temperature, humidity, windspeed, wind direction, rainfall, incoming and reflected shortwave radiation and net radiation.The early years 2009 - 12 had several data gaps. Shadowing of the radiometric equipment continues to cause artifacts on the radiometers - these can be seen as reduction in downwelling radiation with solar inclination. The site is part of the FNQ Rainforest SuperSite - associated with the Daintree node, which is part of the TERN Australian SuperSite Network (ASN). \nFor additional site information, see https://supersites.tern.org.au/supersites/fnqr-daintree .",

    "description": "This dataset presents the footprint of the percentage of adults who saw a dentist, hygienist or dental specialist in the preceding 12 months. The data spans the years of 2013-2017 and is aggregated to 2015 Department of Health Primary Health Network (PHN) areas, based on the 2011 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nThe data is sourced from the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) 2016-17 Patient Experience Survey, collected between 1 July 2016 and 30 June 2017. It also includes data from previous Patient Experience Surveys conducted in 2013-14, 2014-15 and 2015-16. The Patient Experience Survey is conducted annually by the ABS and collects information from a representative sample of the Australian population. The Patient Experience Survey is one of several components of the Multipurpose Household Survey, as a supplement to the monthly Labour Force Survey. The Patient Experience Survey collects data on persons aged 15 years and over, who are referred to as adults for this data collection.\nFor further information about this dataset, visit the data source:Australian Institute of Health and Welfare - Patient experiences in Australia Data Tables.\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data using the Department of Health - PHN Areas.\n\n\nPercentages are calculated based on counts that have been randomly adjusted by the ABS to avoid the release of confidential data.\n\n\nAs an indication of the accuracy of estimates, 95% confidence intervals were produced. These were calculated by the ABS using standard error estimates of the proportion.\n\n\nSome of the patient experience measures for 2016-17 have age-standardised rates presented. Age-standardised rates are hypothetical rates that would have been observed if the populations studied had the same age distribution as the standard population.\n\n\nCrude rates are provided for all years. They should be used for understanding the patterns of actual service use or level of experience in a particular PHN.\n\n\nThe Patient Experience Survey excludes persons aged less than 15 years, persons living in non-private dwellings and the Indigenous Community Strata (encompassing discrete Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities).\n\n\nData for Northern Territory should be interpreted with caution as the Patient Experience Survey excluded the Indigenous Community Strata, which comprises around 25% of the estimated resident population of the Northern Territory living in private dwellings.\n\n\nNP - Not available for publication. The estimate is considered to be unreliable. Values assigned to NP in the original data have been set to null.\n\n",

    "description": "Flow cytometry data was collected in March 2010, in waters off South Australia. \nThe general purpose of the study is to be able to establish background knowledge on the ecosystem on the continental shelf of South Australia and the impact of upwelling/saline outflow events on microbial communities to ultimately develop a biogeochemical model of the region. Sampling was carried out during cruises conducted on board the RV Ngerin as part of the Southern Australian Integrated Marine System (SAIMOS). During each cruise, the physical, chemical and biological properties of the chlorophyll fluorescence maximum (FM) layer were investigated. Flow cytometry data has been collected for picophytoplankton, bacteria and viruses.\n\nSix main stations have been sampled over the course of the study, five are located on the 100 m isobath, i.e. RS (35.508S, 136.278E), B2 (35.418S, 136.148E), B3 (35.258S, 136.048E), B4 (35.168S, 135.418E) and B5 (35.008S, 135.198E), and one from an offshore station (B1; 36.188S, 136.178E) located southwest of Kangaroo Island. Note that combining the distances between stations (14–25 nautical miles), the average component of the current velocity at middepth along the shelf (0.01 m s21) and the average speed of the vessel (i.e. 9 knots) indicate that different water masses were sampled at each station. Additional samples have on occasion been collected from the National Reference Station (NRS) at Kangaroo Island (35.832S, 136.447E) and the SA Spencer Gulf Mouth Mooring (SAM8SG, 35.25S, 136.690E), where the saline outflow occurs.",

    "description": "This dataset estimates human mobility through origin destination (OD) movement flow among the Statistical Area 2 (SA2) regions in Queensland (QLD), connected by public transport (PT) networks. The SA2 regions of Queensland connected by buses, trains, trams and ferries have been used to evaluate OD movement flows. The passenger OD movement data among different stations (or the station-based OD flow) are first estimated using a statistical estimation methodology. The stations-based OD flow data are then translated into region-based OD matrices using the state-of-art method. For more information please see the original metadata file here.\nHuman mobility data is a key ingredient in various areas and domains of research including epidemiology, policy and administration, criminology, transportation, logistics and supply chains, environmental management and, pollution and contamination. High quality human mobility data provided by telecommunication companies collected from call data records (CDRs) is available at prohibitive cost with restrictive licensing, keeping it out of reach for the majority of research community. On the other hand, there is an abundance of high-quality public data, reporting different aspects of mobility. Examples are the public transport patronage and information about the usage of the Australian road network. These datasets are collected by different organisations and government departments and are presented in various formats. For instance, data may be collected at different spatial (e.g. at state or postcode levels) and temporal scales and be presented in the form of passenger counts or aggregated movement flows. This dataset addresses the general lack of national scale comprehensive human mobility dataset in Australia by transforming available mobility data into a consistent format that is suitable for analysis in a broad range of research areas. Merging the various individual datasets into Australia's first comprehensive, national-scale human mobility data asset drastically improves the quality and coverage of existing datasets.\nThe Mobility Australia project received investment (https://doi.org/10.47486/DP702) from the Australian Research Data Commons (ARDC). The ARDC is funded by the National Collaborative Research Infrastructure Strategy (NCRIS).\nThe original data tables were structured in a matrix-like format. AURIN employed a methodology to merge diverse datasets into a comprehensive one, categorising based on transportation types (e.g., trains, buses, rails, ferries), years (e.g., 2019, 2020, 2021, etc.), and temporal scales (e.g., weekly, monthly, yearly). Subsequently, AURIN spatially enabled the original data by employing the 2021 edition of the Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS). The flow between origin and destination pairs is visually represented using line geometry.",

    "description": "\n## **Abstract** \nThis dataset was compiled by the Geological and Bioregional Assessment Program from source data referenced within the dataset and/or metadata. Effective environmental impact assessment (EIA) relies on rigorous scientific assessment of all potential causal pathways by which large-scale developments may impact on valued assets in a region. Despite their importance to decision-making, many EIAs are flawed by incomplete analysis of causal pathways, limited spatial assessment and a lack of transparency about how risks have been evaluated across the region. To address these, we developed an EIA methodology based on network analysis of potential causal pathways in a given region. This network approach is coupled with a systematic evaluation of the likelihood, consequence and mitigation options for each causal pathway from one or more human activities to multiple valued assets. The method includes analysis of the confidence in these evaluations, recognizing where knowledge gaps constrain assessments of risks to particular assets. The causal network approach is complemented by a spatially explicit analysis of the region that allows residual risk (i.e. risk remaining after all feasible mitigations) to be mapped for all valued assets. This identifies which activities could lead to potential impacts of varying concern (rated from ‘very low’ to ‘very 21 high’), their likely pathways, which valued assets are at risk and where these residual risks are greatest. The output maps reveal ‘risk hotspots’ where more detailed local-scale assessments and monitoring should focus. This dataset contains the spreadsheets describing the causal network for the Beetaloo region and the spatial grids evaluating likelihood, consequence and mitigation. The dataset also contains a spreadsheet summarising the results and all output grids with the level of concern.\n\n\n## **Attribution** \nGeological and Bioregional Assessment Program\n\n\n## **History** \nThis dataset has the input spreadsheet describing the nodes and links in the Beetaloo causal network (BEE_input.xlsx) and the spreadsheet summarizing the results of the spatial causal network analysis (BEE_output.xlsx). The dataset also contains all the grids associated with the link evaluations (grids/input) as geotiff files. The filename corresponds to the entries in the gridname column in the input spreadsheet. The dataset also contains the output grids as geotiff files. These are stored in the directory grids/outputs, organised in a directory per endpoint. Each of these directories contains: 1. a png file of the subnetwork of links leading to that endpoint, 2. the overall impact grid (geotiff), 3. a heatmap of number of processes of concern for each endpoint (geotiff) and three subdirectories (activity, stressor, process) of the impact grids of the causal pathways that contain the activity, stressor or process.",

    "title": "Parent Record: Social monogamy in the fiddler crab Uca capricornis",
    "description": "Fiddler crabs are not generally considered subjects for the study of monogamy as they tend to live in dense mixed sex colonies with numerous neighbours and individually defended territories. Here, a series of experiments have been conducted demonstrating the unique relationship between neighbouring males and females in the species Uca capricornis. These experiments illustrate that this species of fiddler crab is socially monogamous. Six experiments were conducted in relation to this investigation in the East Point Reserve, Darwin from November to January in 2002-2006: \n\n1) Natural male-female interactions and territoriality - Twenty-one pairs were filmed from overhead for a period of 30 minutes. Any activity was noted, as was any interactions with intruders. Territoriality was also examined, providing the overall area covered by the crabs within the half hour. By aligning the male and female territories with their respective burrows it was possible to determine the area overlap between them. \n\n2) Sex ratio and distribution - The purpose of this experiment was to determine whether females may be a limited resource within a population of Uca capricornis. The sex ratio in relation to size was determined. The location of burrows was also recorded to determine whether the males and females were distributed independently of each other. The distance to, and sex of, the nearest resident for each individual was also measured to compare mean distances between male-female neighbours and between male-male neighbours.\n\n3) Burrow tenure -To determine whether male-female pairs were longer lasting than male-male pairs, we documented the number of crabs that were still present in their same burrow after 24 hours. \n\n4) 'Neighbour' and 'stranger' relations - This experiment was designed to demonstrate how a male fiddler crab responds to different individuals tethered near to his burrow. The response of a male crab to the neighbour and a stranger (with similar physical characteristics) was observed.\n\n5) Response of paired crabs when faced with intruders of differing sex. This experiment was designed to determine if males and females are unable to associate with multiple partners because their partners aggressively repel same-sex intruders. \n\n6) Size-assortative mating -This experiment was designed to examine whether the nearest female or male neighbour was correlated with the size of a focal male. This investigation was based upon data collected during the other experiments.",

That is construction is completed in blocks, so that there may be large upward jumps in some weeks and less or none in others. Following completion of the construction process passing premises in the streets, further validation of address data is undertaken of the ‘as-built’ network against estimates obtained from national address data.

The source datasets are identified in the Lineage field in this metadata statement. The processes undertaken to produce this derived dataset are described in the History field in this metadata statement. \n\n\n\nAs suggested by its title, the file provides the domain boundary where a groundwater model will be constructed for the Clarence-Moreton bioregion.\n\n## **Purpose** \n\nIt's created to limit the groundwater model extent.\n\n## **Dataset History** \n\nThe model domain extent and its boundaries were defined based on the following criteria:\n\n\\*\tThe model's outermost boundaries were placed far enough from the coal seam development area, such that they do not interfere with  the modelling results, that is, it eliminates boundary effects.;\n\n\\*\tModel boundaries should follow existing geological and/or hydrological boundaries.;\n\n\\*\tImportant receptors within and/or close to the development area should be within the areal extents of the groundwater model.\n\n## **Dataset Citation** \n\nBioregional Assessment Programme (2015) CLM Groundwater Model Boundary.

In cases where a partial surrender was approved during the term of the lease, only the final area is represented in this dataset.\nMining Lease polygons delineate areas in which lease holders are permitted to conduct mining operations. Mining Leases may be granted over both Crown and private land, so long as that land falls under the Mineral Resources Development Act 1995. Mining operations include: obtaining and treating minerals, storing and containing minerals or waste material generated on a lease or another area, and activities associated with mining. Mining also includes production activities in relation to a category 4 mineral or a category 6 mineral.",

Data were processed using PyFluxPro (v3.4.18) as described by Isaac et al. (2017). PyFluxPro produces a final, gap-filled product with Net Ecosystem Exchange (NEE) partitioned into Gross Primary Productivity (GPP) and Ecosystem Respiration (ER).\n\nFletcherview Tropical Rangeland SuperSite was established in 2021 at James Cook University’s Fletcherview Research Station, a fully operational outback cattle station located 50&nbsp;km west of Townsville, Queensland. The site is used for cattle grazing and is characterised by tall open savanna. The vegetation is dominated by native grasses such as blackspear and kangaroo grasses, as well as introduced species like buffel grass, signal grass and leucaena. Fletcherview typically experiences a dry and wet season, with most rainfall occurring between January and April.",

    "title": "Potential Groundwater Dependent Ecosystem (GDE) Mapping for the Glenelg Hopkins CMA",
    "description": "Potential Groundwater Dependent Ecosystems (GDE) are ecosystems identified within the landscape as likely to be at least partly dependent on groundwater. State-wide screening analysis was performed to identify locations of potential terrestrial GDEs, including wetland areas. The GDE mapping was developed utilising satellite remote sensing data, geological data and groundwater monitoring data in a GIS overlay model. Validation of the model through field assessment has not been performed. The method has been applied for all of Victoria and is the first step in identifying potential groundwater dependent ecosystems that may be threatened by activities such as drainage and groundwater pumping. The dataset specifically covers the Glenelg Hopkins Catchment Management Authority (CMA) area. The method used in this research is based upon the characteristics of a potential GDE containing area as one that:\n1. Has access to groundwater. By definition a GDE must have access to groundwater. For GDE occurrences associated with wetlands and river systems the water table will be at surface with a zone of capillary extension. In the case of terrestrial GDE's (outside of wetlands and river systems), these are dependent on the interaction between depth to water table and the rooting depth of the vegetation community.\n2. Has summer (dry period) use of water. Due to the physics of root water uptake, GDEs will use groundwater when other sources are no longer available; this is generally in summer for the Victorian climate. The ability to use groundwater during dry periods creates a contrasting growth pattern with surrounding landscapes where growth has ceased.\n3. Has consistent growth patterns, vegetation that uses water all year round will have perennial growth patterns.\n4. Has growth patterns similar to verified GDEs. \nThe current mapping does not indicate the degree of groundwater dependence, only locations in the landscape of potential groundwater dependent ecosystems. This dataset does not directly support interpretation of the amount of dependence or the amount of groundwater used by the regions highlighted within the maps. Further analysis and more detailed field based data collection are required to support this.\n\nThe core data used in the modelling is largely circa 1995 to 2005. It is expected that the methodology used will over estimate the extent of terrestrial GDEs. There will be locations that appear from EvapoTranspiration (ET) data to fulfil the definition of a GDE (as defined by the mapping model) that may not be using groundwater. Two prominent examples are: 1. Riparian zones along sections of rivers and creeks that have deep water tables where the stream feeds the groundwater system and the riparian vegetation is able to access this water flow, as well as any bank storage contained in the valley alluvials. 2. Forested regions that are accessing large unsaturated regolith water stores.\nThe terrestrial GDE layer polygons are classified based on the expected depth to groundwater (ie shallow &lt;5 m or deep &gt;5 m). Additional landscape attributes are also assigned to each mappnig polygon.\n\nIn 2011-2012 a species tolerance model was developed by Arthur Rylah Institute, collaborating with DPI, to model landscapes with ability to support GDEs and to provide a relative measure of sensitivity of those ecosystems to changes in groundwater availability and quality. Rev 1 of the GDE mapping incorporates species tolerance model attributes for each potential GDE polygon and attributes for interpreted depth to groundwater.\n\nSeparate datasets and associated metadata records have been created for GDE species tolerance.",

    "description": "\n## **Abstract** \nThis dataset contains the hydrochemical and environmental tracer data of a fortnightly time series and event-driven precipitation data between October 2019 and March 2021 created as part of the Geological and Bioregional Assessment Program (GBA) stage 3 in the Beetaloo Sub-basin. A total of 28 spring samples were collected and analysed for a number of parameters including hydrochemistry (major and minor ions) and the environmental tracers 222Rn, 18O, 2H. Samples are from Bitter Spring (2 locations), Rainbow Spring and Fig Tree Spring at Mataranka. Further 19 rainwater samples were taken at the ranger station in Mataranka and analysed for 18O & 2H. The data showed the variability of Fig-Tree Spring indicating that part of the water discharging is sourced from a swampy upstream area and flows to the spring along a short flow distance. Bitter Spring and Rainbow Spring show steady values hardly influenced by seasons and therefore have mean residence times above 4-5years. Significant values of helium above solubility equilibrium also indicate the presence of an older component, probably circulating on the time scale of centuries.\n\n\n## **Attribution** \nGeological and Bioregional Assessment Program\n\n\n## **History** \nSamples were taken by Mataranka Rangers and sent by post to CSIRO Waite Campus, Adelaide for 222Rn measurement and to CDU in Darwin for 18O, 2H and hydrochemistry measurement. Alkalinity was measured by titration. Stable isotopes 2H and 18O of water were measured on a Picarro Cavity-Ring Down Laser Spectrometer, are calibrated versus VSMOW and given in the usual delta notation. Anions were measured by ion chromatography and cations by ICP-OES. Radon extraction followed the procedure outlined in Leaney & Herczeg (2006) and measurements were done using Liquid Scintillation Spectroscopy on a Quantulus Counter. Data are reported as measured without further post-processing.",

    "description": "This dataset presents counts of payment recipients by payment type for the quarter ending September 2013. The data is based on the recipient's geocoded address aggregated by Local Government Area (LGA) from the Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS) 2013.\nThe Department of Social Services (DSS) is the Australian Government's lead agency in the development and delivery of social policy, and is working to improve the lifetime wellbeing of people and families in Australia. DSS' policies and services respond to need across people's lives - looking after families, children and older people; providing a safety net for people who cannot fully support themselves; enhancing the wellbeing of people with high needs; assisting people who need help with care; and supporting a diverse and harmonious society. DSS supports people and families in Australia by encouraging independence and participation, and supporting a cohesive society.\nFor more information on this dataset please visit the Australian Government Open Data.\nFor further details on payments, see 'A guide to Australian Government payments'.\nPlease note:\n\n\nIn order to protect individuals' privacy, identified populations between 1 and 19 have been suppressed and replaced with '&lt;20' for confidentiality purposes. Additional data may be suppressed and replaced with 'n.p.' (not provided) to prevent the derivation of identified populations that have values of less than 20.\n\n\nIndividuals who live overseas, individuals who are without a valid home address and individuals who only have a postal address cannot be assigned to a locational boundary. State/territory totals derived from Local Government Area data will not match actual state and territory totals, due to different statistical geography methodologies.\n\n\nCaveats specific to payments type can be found in the relevant payment description of the original data.\n\n\nAURIN has spatialised this dataset and have made the following replacements to enforce data type consistency: \n\n\n'&lt;20' has been assigned a value of '-1' within the data\n\n\nA boolean field has been created for each data field to flag left-censored data. 'True' is assigned to fields that have been censored.\n\n\n'n.p.' (not provided) has been set to Null within the data.\n\n",

    "description": "Data compiled within this feature class is combined extent of the nominated Hunter Valley Remnant Woodlands and Open Forests found across the Lower Hunter region (Cessnock, Newcastle, Lake Macquarie, Port Stephens and Maitland LGAs). This data is for the EPBC Act Listed Ecological Communities Mapping in the Lower Hunter project and has been consolidated to help map the extent of Threatened Ecological Communities (TECs) in this area. This data will aid in reviewing and analysing the likelihood of occurrence of EPBC Act listed flora and fauna within the Threatened Ecological Communities, and also support the process of identifying and providing recommendations regarding High Priority Conservation Areas within the region. Recommendations from this data regarding Key Threatening Processes have the potential to impact EPBC Act – listed ecological communities and threatened flora and fauna.\n\n* The GIS mapping data were obtained to inform sustainability planning for the Lower Hunter region, particularly to assist in informing the NSW government review of the NSW Lower Hunter regional strategy and Lower Hunter regional conservation plan.\n * Once this review is complete, the second stage is to undertake a strategic assessment of proposed urban development and related infrastructure corridors. The NSW Government has entered into an agreement with the Commonwealth to conduct a strategic assessment of proposed urban development and related infrastructure corridors.\n* The data provide the best available maps of the regional distribution of two Critically Endangered Ecological Communities protected under national environmental law – the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 (EPBC Act) – as well as the distribution of three vegetation communities nominated for listing as threatened species and ecological communities under the EPBC Act. \n * Vegetation definitions used to map the distribution of the three nominated communities are preliminary and subject to change through the listing determination process. Changes to the definition of a vegetation community may result in changes to the mapped distribution of the community.\n* While reasonable efforts have been made to ensure that the contents of this dataset are factually correct, the Commonwealth does not accept responsibility for the accuracy or completeness of the contents, and shall not be liable for any loss or damage that may be occasioned directly or indirectly through the use of, or reliance on, the contents of this dataset.CC - Attribution (CC BY)\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Australia License.

    "description": "This dataset contains spatial layers describing Forest Canopy Loss and Recovery from 1998-2019 in NSW Regional Forest Agreements (RFA) Areas along the eastern coast. \n\nThese have been based off the National Greenhouse Gas Inventory (NGGI) National Carbon Accounting System (NCAS) National Forest and Sparse Woody Vegetation Data grids (ABARES, 2020). These base grids are Landsat in origin and have a resolution of 25m.  \n\nFor this dataset product and the processing of metrics, aspects of canopy loss and disturbances in the forest estate were investigated.  Measures of canopy loss and recovery are seen as one of the multiple indicators of forest health.  This is related to agents or pressures that affect the capacity of native forests and commercial operations to maintain normal ecosystem functions and sustainably provide productive capacity. \n\nTo attribute disturbances, as a driver of change, a Multiple Lines of Evidence (MLE) approach was used that leveraged available spatial datasets.  This allowed for a project-wide disturbance and disturbance context layer to be generated. This information can be interpreted back against forest cover extent change outputs, in particular the differences between individual years, to identify the areas of change and the likely reasons why. Therefore, landscape trends in forest loss can be potentially assigned or at the very least investigated.  \n\nThe time taken, in terms of years, for areas to recover from losses in forest canopy cover extent can has also been determined. This process identifies the time taken for a patch of forest to return to a 20% canopy cover threshold, and other characteristics such as the forest type and likely disturbance or loss event. \n\nForest Canopy Loss and Recovery uses measures of canopy loss and disturbances which can be interpreted back against forest cover extent change outputs, in particular the differences between individual years, to identify the areas of change and the likely reasons why. Therefore, landscape trends in forest canopy loss can be potentially assigned or at the very least investigated. Time taken in years for areas to recover for losses has also been determined, as-well as other characteristics such as forest type and likely disturbance/loss event. \n\nBase cover extent grids used are from the NSW RFA Historic Forest Canopy Cover Extent – 1995 to 2019 product.\n\nRead more about the project on the Natural Resources Commission website:\nhttps://www.nrc.nsw.gov.au/accordion-content-main/fmip-ecosystemhealth-projectfe1\n\nThis dataset is superseded by 'NSW Forest Monitoring and Improvement Program State-Wide Historic Forest Canopy Loss and Recovery - 1998 to 2020'",

    "description": "Regional Parks are open spaces identified as having regionally significant value for conservation, recreation and community use. There are regional parks situated around metropolitan Perth and Bunbury that protect a range of natural areas including foreshores, ocean beaches, wetlands and the Darling Scarp. The current land tenure arrangements within the regional parks are complex with a number of different tenures and landholders existing. These may include Commonwealth or State land, local government land, private freehold land where the landowner has agreed, UCL and unmanaged reserve.\nRegional Parks provide an opportunity for coordinated land use management and planning. Parks and Wildlife works closely with local councils and community groups to manage these diverse multi purpose areas. Each Park has a community advisory committee made up of local people who advocate for the park's management on behalf of stakeholders.The Department for Planning and Infrastructure has proceeded to, and will continue to, acquire the land that is required to consolidate the parks.\n\nWas formally (DPAW-032)",

    "description": "This data set is from a survey comparing the size and shape of limpets in the high intertidal zone compared to the low intertidal zone on a rocky shore in Western Port Bay, Victoria. On 10 sampling occasions from April to October 1987 the length, width, height, distance from apex to the posterior margin, distance from apex to the anterior margin and the number of ridges of 350 limpets were measured in both zones. The tenacities of individual limpets in the 2 zones were collected in September and October 1987. Tenacity was measured with a hand-held device that applied a horizontal force until the limpet was detached from the substrate.",

    "description": "THE STUDY AREA\nThe Upper Parramatta River catchment covers an area of 110 square kilometres and\ncovers all land that drains to the Parramatta River upstream of its tidal limit at the\nCharles Street Weir, between the Barry Wilde Bridge (Wilde Avenue) and the Gasworks\nBridge (Macarthur Street). Most of the catchment is urbanised and has a population of\nmore than 230,000. However, there are significant areas of urban bushland, generally\nlocated along the major watercourses.\nA map of the study area is presented as Figure 1.1. The Upper Parramatta River has\na number of tributaries that flow into it within the study area. The two largest tributaries\nare Toongabbie Creek and Darling Mills Creek. Other tributaries include the following:\n\nBrickfield Creek;\nDomain Creek;\nFinlaysons Creek;\nCoopers Creek;\nPendle Creek (also known as Pendle Hill Creek);\nGreystanes Creek (also known as Girraween Creek);\nGrantham Creek;\nBlacktown Creek;\nLalor Creek;\nQuarry Creek;\nThe Quarry Branch (also known as Northmead Gully);\nExcelsior Creek;\nBlue Gum Creek;\nRifle Range Creek;\nHunts Creek.\n\nThe Upper Parramatta River catchment includes parts of the following four local\ngovernment areas (LGAs):\n\nShire of Baulkham Hills — including the suburbs of Oatlands, Carlingford, North\nRocks, Northmead, North Parramatta, West Pennant Hills, Castle Hill and\nBaulkham Hills;\nCity of Blacktown — including the suburbs of Toongabbie, Seven Hills, Prospect,\nBlacktown, Lalor Park and Kings Langley;\nCity of Holroyd — including the suburbs of Westmead, Wentworthville, South\nWentworthville, Greystanes, Pendle Hill, Girraween, Prospect, Toongabbie and\nMerrylands West;\nCity of Parramatta — including the suburbs of Parramatta, North Parramatta,\nWestmead, Northmead, Wentworthville, Toongabbie, Old Toongabbie and\nWinston Hills.\n\nOBJECTIVES OF THIS STUDY\nThe primary objective of the current Upper Parramatta River Floodplain Risk\nManagement Study and Plan is to bring together, and place in appropriate context, all\npast, current and proposed future activities related to the reduction of flood risk in the\ncatchment. In broad terms, the current study has investigated what can be done to\nminimise the effects of flooding in the Upper Parramatta River catchment and\nrecommended a strategy in the form of a Floodplain Risk Management Plan.\nAs mentioned above, despite the expenditure of more than $35 million on flood\nmitigation works and measures since 1989, none of the four councils within the area of\nthe Trust have adopted a formal Floodplain Risk Management Plan as required by the\nNew South Wales (NSW) Government’s Flood Prone Land Policy. This study and plan\nconstitute key components of the NSW Government’s floodplain risk management\nprocess as outlined in the Floodplain Management Manual (NSW Government, 2001)\n(see Section 1.4).\nSome of the objectives of the study include:\n\nbriefly outlining the hydrological and hydraulic modelling activities that have been\nundertaken for the catchment to date;\nbriefly reviewing the past, current and future flood-related activities of the Trust\nand the four constituent Councils;\nreviewing, in detail, issues relating to planning and development controls within\nthe catchment’s floodplains;\nidentifying additional floodplain risk management measures that particularly relate\nto community awareness about flooding, the release of flood-related information\nto the community, flood warning and emergency management;\ndeveloping a mutually agreeable Floodplain Risk Management Plan for the Upper\nParramatta River catchment that outlines the best measures to reduce flood\ndamage, based on environmental, social, economic, financial and engineering\nconsiderations.\n\nReport\nThe structure of this report is as follows:\nChapter 2 summarises the flood problems, together with the behaviour and\nimpacts of flooding in the Upper Parramatta River catchment. Chapter 2 also\ndiscusses the modelling of flood flows and flood levels in the catchment;\nChapter 3 provides an overview of the previous flood-related studies and\ninvestigations that have been undertaken in the catchment, together with an\noutline of the available mapping and survey that has been carried out;\nChapter 4 presents an overview of floodplain risk management measures\navailable for dealing with flood problems generally and the methodology used to\nassess these management measures in the current study. The large number of\nfloodplain risk management measures that have already examined and\nimplemented in the catchment are also listed in this chapter;\nChapter 5 discusses possible future floodplain risk management options for the\nUpper Parramatta River catchment, particularly flood-related planning and\ndevelopment controls, community awareness about flooding, the release of floodrelated\ninformation to the community, flood warning and emergency\nmanagement;\nChapter 6 lists all the documents referenced in this study;\nChapter 7 provides a bibliography of all studies and investigations that have\nbeen undertaken in the catchment since the early 1970s;\nChapter 8 provides a glossary of terms used in this study.",

The Future Reef MAP project is funded by Rio Tinto Alcan and administered by the Great Barrier Reef Foundation, with an equal co-investment by CSIRO. The project is the first large-scale CO2 observing system established on the Great Barrier Reef using the Rio Tinto ship, RTM Wakmatha. The research is targeted at providing information on the CO2 uptake and the controls on ocean acidification change in the region. It is providing foundation data needed to assess the vulnerability of the GBR reefs to ocean acidification. This dataset contains quality controlled underway measurements of the fugacity of CO2, atmospheric pressure, and sea surface temperature and salinity. The data management and distribution of these data were supported by the CSIRO Carbon Collaboration Cluster and the Australian Coastal Ecosystem Facility.",

    "description": "This dataset presents the school zones for Prep/Foundation Junior Secondary schools in Victoria for the year of 2020.\nAll public primary and secondary schools, including Prep/Foundation to Year 9 and multi-campus schools have enrolment zones. This does not include schools with specific enrolment criteria including English Language Schools and Select Entry Schools. Specialist schools also do not have zones and have special enrolment criteria.\nDesignated neighbourhood schools are generally the public school within closest proximity to the student’s permanent residential address, unless the Minister for Education or Regional Director has restricted the zone of the school. Closest proximity is calculated as the nearest school by straight line distance in metropolitan areas (including Geelong, Ballarat and Bendigo), or the nearest school by shortest practical route (in regional areas). Zones were produces in Datum 1994 VicGrid projection (EPSG: 3111) using locations that represent the front of the school or driveway access. Voronoi polygons define the measure of straight line distance and calculations using road classes 0 to 7 in the VicMap road network layer were used to define the measure of shortest practical route. \nThe zones of schools defined as metropolitan have taken preference over the zones of regional schools where they interface. A small number of zones have been restricted by the Minister for Education to support schools in managing their enrolments. Some schools zones have been aligned with structural and geographic barriers recognising the significant accessibility issues they impose. School enrolment zones are reviewed annually and updated as government school provision changes. The school zone dataset is comprised of distinct map layers for primary schools and for each year of secondary school, acknowledging the different year levels offered by schools.\nFor more information please visit the Victorian Government Data Portal or the Find My School website.\nPlease note: \n\nThe Victorian school zone layers can be used in conjunction with the Victorian school location layers.\n",

    "description": "Overview  \r\n This report examines Australian and international experience in monitoring farmgate and retail prices for food products. It also outlines a simple methodology to monitor farm shares and farm-to-retail price spreads for food products, and investigates the potential to apply the methodology to Australian data. \r\n\r\n Key Points  \r\n• The food retail sector in Australia is highly concentrated while there is increasing consolidation in the food processing sector. There is some concern that this could lead to farmers receiving lower prices and consumers paying higher prices than would be the case in a perfectly competitive market. \r\n• The paper reviews local and international research in monitoring movements in farm and retail prices for food products, outlines a simple methodology to monitor farm shares and farm-to-retail price spreads for food products, and investigates the potential to apply the methodology to Australian data. \r\n• The review of international research found significant variation across countries in the importance they place on food price monitoring and analysis. Research has consistently found that the more processed food products are, the lower the farm share, and that farm shares have generally been declining over time. \r\n• The review also found that the United States Department of Agriculture Economic Research Service (USDA ERS) is a world leader in analysing prices in food supply chains. The paper outlines a relatively simple methodology used by the USDA ERS to monitor changes in farm shares and farm-to-retail price spreads for food products. \r\n• While there are limitations with the USDA ERS approach, an increase in farm-to-retail price spread or a decrease in farm share of the retail price could be a useful early indicator that competition issues are emerging within a supply chain. However, additional analysis will always be required to confirm whether the cause was an increase in market power because these changes can occur for a number of reasons, including differences in productivity in different sectors or input prices increasing at a faster rate in the retail sector than in the farm sector. Unfortunately, there is generally a lack of data that will allow a breakdown in marketing costs to facilitate this analysis. \r\n• One option for additional research is to replicate another methodology developed by the USDA ERS, which uses input-output data to decompose costs and profits between different sectors within a supply chain and to estimate returns to primary factors, including capital and labour. This type of analysis would be more expensive than the high-level analysis described in this paper but it would also be more informative than the farm share/price spread analysis in identifying the range of factors influencing prices, and lead to a more informed debate about the various factors influencing prices, including market power. \r\n",

    "description": "This data was collected in January 2008 by the IMOS Ship of Opportunity Underway CO2 Measurement research group on RV Southern Surveyor (IMOS platform code: VLHJ) voyage SS012008.\n\nDeparted: \tHobart, Tasmania, January 11, 2008\nArrived:  \tHobart, Tasmania February 01, 2008\n\nCO2 System Overview:\nThe fugacity of carbon dioxide (fCO2) in surface seawater was measured using a General Oceanics Inc. automated system (Model 8050; Pierrot et al 2009). Seawater is sprayed into an equilibration chamber and CO2 in the headspace gas equilibrates with the seawater. The headspace gas is pumped through a thermoelectric condenser followed by a nafion drying tube before flowing through a Licor 7000 non-dispersive infrared gas analyser used to measure the CO2 mole fraction (XCO2) of the dried air. The gas flow is stopped temporarily for the CO2 measurements, which are made at atmospheric pressure. A set of four CO2 standards that cover the range of CO2 values expected in the ocean are analysed about every four hours to calibrate the gas analyser. The standard gas concentrations are on the WMO-X2007 mole fraction scale for CO2-in-air. Atmospheric XCO2 (dry) is measured after the standards by pumping clean outside air from an intake on the forward mast of the ship. \n\nSeawater intake and ancillary data:\nThe seawater intake is located at about 5.5m depth in the bow of the ship. Sea surface salinity is measured using a thermosalinograph (Seabird Electronics SBE21) located next to the CO2 system. A remote temperature sensor (Seabird Electronics SBE 38) located at the intake is used to measure sea surface temperature (SST). The travel time between the intake and CO2 system is typically about 4 minutes with warming usually less than 0.6ºC. The thermosalinograph water is from the same intake, but the supply lines separate after the intake. A comparison of thermosalinograph and equilibrator temperature records shows the temperature difference in the two lines is generally less than 0.1ºC. The thermosalinograph water line travels outside the ship and is typically warmer than the equilibrator. The travel time in water line to the thermosalinograph is 2.5 minutes faster than to the equilibrator. \n\nMeteorological data, salinity, SST, and ships position and time are taken from the ships logging system. These parameters and the data quality are maintained by the Australian Marine National Facility.",

    "description": "As part of MTSRF Project 4.8.1, this study aimed to assess the benefit of no-take (green) zones as a recruitment source. 1342 adult stripey snapper (Lutjanus carponotatus) from 3 green zones around the Keppel Islands were fin-clipped for genetic analysis and released. Microsatellite markers were used to assign juveniles to one or both parents. From the 483 juveniles collected from 16 sites in both green and blue zones, 140 (~30%) were assigned to one or both parents from the adult sample. Of the 140 juveniles, 16% had recruited into home green zones, 62% had dispersed into blue zones, and the remainder had dispersed among other green zones.\n\n\nReferences:\n\nAlmany GR, Hamilton RJ,  Williamson DH, Evans RD, Jones GP, Matawai M, Potuku T, Rhodes KL, Russ GR and Sawynok B.

Overlay maps may apply to all or part of your property and your property may be affected by more than one overlay. Having an overlay on your property will only affect you if you intend to develop (i.e. extent or build, change use, subdivide, clear native vegetation, fill or excavate). \nThe attribute fields are defined as per Qld Planning Provisions, Schedule 2. The Queensland Planning Provisions (QPP) are the standard planning scheme provisions made by the Minister for Planning under Chapter 2, Part 5, Division 2 and Chapter 2, Part 6 of the Sustainable Planning Act 2009.",

    "description": "The Macquarie Rivulet catchment drains an area of 110 square kilometres extending from the shores of Lake Illawarra upstream for a distance of approximately 23 km to the Illawarra escarpment. The upper parts of the catchment (up to 770 mAHD) are characterised by steep gradients moving to flatter terrain in the lower reaches of Macquarie Rivulet dropping to approximately mean sea level. The catchment is made up of a number of tributaries including the main Macquarie Rivulet, as well as Frazers Creek, Marshall Mount Creek and Yellow Rock Creek. There have been several recorded instances of flood-producing storms in the catchment, including February 1984, June 1991, February 1992 and most recently March 2011. The largest recent historical floods within the catchment are believed to have occurred in 1959, 1961 and 1975, however there is limited information regarding these earlier floods.\n\nThe key objective of the Macquarie Rivulet Flood Study is the development of computational hydrologic and hydraulic models that define design flood behaviour for the 20%, 10%, 5%, 2%, 1%, 0.5% and the Probable Maximum Flood (PMF) design storms in the study area. The key sequential reporting stages include:\n<ul>\n<li>Stage 1: Data Collection plus Assessment and Community Consultation;</li>\n<li>Stage 2: Model Calibration and Validation;</li>\n<li>Stage 3: Modelling and Mapping of Design Flood Events.</li>\n</ul>",

    "description": "This dataset provides Australian Bureau of Statistics mesh block boundaries with integrated census demographics for Kalgoorlie-Boulder, enabling aggregation of building-level solar potential to standard statistical geography units for policy analysis and planning.\n\nThe dataset contains 530 mesh blocks - the finest-resolution census geography - enriched with 2021 Census dwelling and population counts, complete hierarchical statistical area codes (SA1-SA4), and topographic classifications. Mesh blocks serve as the fundamental spatial unit linking building-level solar estimates to Australian statistical datasets, enabling integration with census, health, transport, and other ABS data collections.\n\nKey applications include analysing solar potential per capita across neighbourhoods, identifying areas with high rooftop capacity relative to population density, evaluating equity in renewable energy access across socio-economic areas, and aggregating building-level results to SA2 or SA3 regions for regional planning. This geography enables comparative analysis with other Australian cities using standardised ABS boundaries.\n\nTarget users include policy analysts requiring census-compatible spatial units, researchers linking solar potential to demographic or socio-economic variables, and government planners developing place-based renewable energy strategies. The hierarchical statistical area codes enable flexible aggregation from mesh blocks (finest scale) through SA1-SA4 to the state level.\n\nMesh block boundaries reflect 2021 Census geography and differ from 2016 Census in some locations. Use the \"changed since 2016\" flag to identify modified boundaries. Population counts represent usual residence on Census night, not daytime presence relevant to commercial solar usage.\n\nComprehensive technical documentation, including data dictionary, usage examples, and processing methodology, is available in <a href=\"https://resources.aurin.org.au/ckan/resources/DataSet-Information.pdf\">here</a>; software stack details and calculation workflows are documented in <a href=\"https://resources.aurin.org.au/ckan/resources/Software_Stack.pdf\">here</a>.",

High boron levels are often associated with windblown deposition of marine sediments, lower rainfall areas and impermeable clay layers (due to reduced leaching). Mapping shows the estimated average depth to toxic boron levels, while detailed proportion data are supplied for calculating respective areas of each boron toxicity class (spatial data statistics).",

    "description": "Traditional pulsar searching techniques are not sensitive enough to extreme pulsars such as millisecond pulsars (MSPs) in compact binaries (e.g., Pulsar-Blackhole binary systems), extremely fast spinning pulsars (e.g., sub-MSPs), and high dispersion measure (DM) pulsars. Such a situation is now changed thanks to the development of next generation radio telescope arrays such as Australian Square Kilometer Array Pathfinder (ASKAP). ASKAP is capable of conducting highly sensitive radio continuum surveys with wide sky coverage (e.g, Evolutionary Map of The Universe survey). One of the solutions is to find pulsar candidates in radio continuum surveys such as ASKAP surveys and then carry out targeted searches. This technique allows us to search over the wide bandwidth with full field of view while avoiding the need for expensive pixel-by-pixel high time resolution searches. In this proposal, we propose to observe 16 pulsar candidates identified in the Galactic plane using new ASKAP EMU images. We found 22 candidates by selecting sources with spectral index steeper than -2.0 and compactness less than 1.2. Among them 13 are known pulsars and a reasonable number of candidates to follow up (9 sources). In total, we have 16 candidates including seven sources from 2023APRS semester. Because of the dense ionised medium in the Galactic Plane, MSPs are likely to be missed by previous pulsar surveys carried out at 1.4 GHz. Here, we propose a targeted pulsar search with the Parkes UWL which allow us to search pulsation at higher frequencies and therefore avoid strong DM smearing and scattering effects.",

    "description": "    \n\nRelative Yield From Sodicity (%) dataset is one of 11 national surfaces,\nrepresented by ~1km grids, relating to economic opportunities associated with\nsoil condition. All dollar values are given in 1996/97 Australian dollars.\nThere are three sub-types of data in this dataset: relative yields, gross\nbenefits and impact costs. Each is described as follows:1. Relative yield\n(RY): This is the yield of the crop or pasture, relative to its full potential\nexpressed as a percentage. It is equal to actual yield divided by potential\nyield. The relative yield surfaces, measured as a ratio (0 to 1) and\nrepresented with a 1km grid, include: * ry_salt2000; ry_salt2020: The relative\nyield of salinity in the year 2000 and 2020* ry_Acid; ry_Esp: The relative\nyield from soil acidity and soil sodicity* ry_min: The limiting factor\nrelative yield a minimum of ry_salt2000, ry_acid, ry_esp and ry_min.*\nlim_fact:Factor most limiting yield a of acidity, sodicity and salinity 2.\nGross benefit (GB): The gross benefit is the additional profit at full equity\nattainable through agricultural production if the yield-limiting factor of\nsalinity, acidity or sodicity were repaired without cost. As such it can be\nconsidered an approximate investment ceiling on treating the soil. The gross\nbenefit grids are measured in $/ha/yr and include:* gb97a; gb97e; gb97s a for\nsoil acidity; sodicity; salinity* gb97m a the combined limiting factor gross\nbenefit. 3. Impact cost (ic97s): This is the decline in agricultural profit at\nfull equity due to worsening dryland salinity severity and extent over the\ntime period 2000 to 2020. It is measured in $/ha/yr. It is determined only\nthrough changes in crop yield as a consequence of changes in dryland salinity.\nImpact cost can be considered the loss in profit at full equity due to\nworsening salinity over the 20yr time period. Keywords: Economics, Natural\nResources, Australia, Salinity, Sodicity, Acidity, Soil TreatmentData is in\nalbers and unprojected, using WGS84 and GDA94.\n\nSee [further metadata](http://data.daff.gov.au/anrdl/metadata_files/pa_easc_r9cl\n__08312a08.xml) for more detail.\n\n",

    "description": "This data was collected in July and August 2008 by the IMOS Ship of Opportunity Underway CO2 Measurement research group on RV Southern Surveyor (IMOS platform code: VLHJ) voyage SS092008.\n\nDeparted: \tCairns, Queensland, July 24, 2008\nArrived:  \tGladstone, Queensland, August 11, 2008\n\nCO2 System Overview:\nThe fugacity of carbon dioxide (fCO2) in surface seawater was measured using a General Oceanics Inc. automated system (Model 8050; Pierrot et al 2009). Seawater is sprayed into an equilibration chamber and CO2 in the headspace gas equilibrates with the seawater. The headspace gas is pumped through a thermoelectric condenser followed by a nafion drying tube before flowing through a Licor 7000 non-dispersive infrared gas analyser used to measure the CO2 mole fraction (XCO2) of the dried air. The gas flow is stopped temporarily for the CO2 measurements, which are made at atmospheric pressure. A set of four CO2 standards that cover the range of CO2 values expected in the ocean are analysed about every four hours to calibrate the gas analyser. The standard gas concentrations are on the WMO-X2007 mole fraction scale for CO2-in-air. Atmospheric XCO2 (dry) is measured after the standards by pumping clean outside air from an intake on the forward mast of the ship. \n\nSeawater intake and ancillary data:\nThe seawater intake is located at about 5.5m depth in the bow of the ship. Sea surface salinity is measured using a thermosalinograph (Seabird Electronics SBE21) located next to the CO2 system. A remote temperature sensor (Seabird Electronics SBE 38) located at the intake is used to measure sea surface temperature (SST). The travel time between the intake and CO2 system is typically about 4 minutes with warming usually less than 0.6ºC. The thermosalinograph water is from the same intake, but the supply lines separate after the intake. A comparison of thermosalinograph and equilibrator temperature records shows the temperature difference in the two lines is generally less than 0.1ºC. The thermosalinograph water line travels outside the ship and is typically warmer than the equilibrator. The travel time in water line to the thermosalinograph is 2.5 minutes faster than to the equilibrator. \n\nMeteorological data, salinity, SST, and ships position and time are taken from the ships logging system. These parameters and the data quality are maintained by the Australian Marine National Facility.",

    "description": "This study assessed the behaviour patterns of four shrimp species in a laboratory experiment that was repeated on 8 separate occasions throughout 1978. The experiment was set up in aquariums with sediment and eelgrass densities that reflected field conditions in Western Port Bay, Victoria. There were 1 to 3 replicate aquarium per run of the experiment. The shrimps species used in the experiment were the abundant species in eelgrass beds in Western Port Bay, Macrobrachium.intermedium, Pontophilus intermedius and Hippolyte caradina. Chlorotocella leptorhyncus. All shrimp species were present in each aquarium with a maximum of 4 individuals of each of the larger species (M.intermedium and P.intermedius), to avoid behavioral artifacts due to overcrowding. The behaviour activities and vertical distribution of each species relative to the substrate was assessed by making repeated observations on the instantaneous activity and location of individuals over a 4 day period. Observations were made in the night and day and were classified into 4 categories; inactive, grooming, feeding, or walking/swimming. \n\nP.intermedius was always inactive during the day, and remained partially buried in surface sediments until night when it emerged to move up into the eelgrass. The relative time devoted to feeding was fairly constant between the other 3 species. Levels of inactivity and grooming behaviour were higher during daylight whereas feeding and walking/swimming was more common at night.",

For plans covering a local government area, Catchment Management Authority, Coastal Management Board area, or township, a nominal buffer was applied around the spatial extent of these administrative units.  For reports containing a clear study area, this boundary was captured and used to depict the geographical area covered by the report.",

    "description": "We propose a modest program to continue monitoring 4 of the 6 known radio magnetars in order to achieve three primary science goals. The first is to characterise magnetar outbursts over long timescales, for which tracking their rotational, flux density, and polarisation properties provide a clear view of the impulse response of their magnetic fields. Second, understanding the links between magnetars the mysterious fast radio burst phenomenon through the discovery of rare emission and propagation effects, shared spectro-temporal phenomenology, and connections to high-energy (X-ray/gamma-ray) phenomena. Lastly, our continued monitoring has enormous benefit to the wider magnetar community, providing rapid alerts to changes in activity, adding context to unusual behaviour detected by high-energy observations, and a host of supplementary science through the teams extensive collaborative networks. The project and its precursors have been running since 2007 and have contributed to 21 publications since then. We are seeking to convert the project to long-term status, thereby also carrying these investigations into the SKA era.",

    "description": "This dataset is a sample of the Heat Health Vulnerability Index (HHVI) from the Australian Urban Health Indicators (AusUrb-HI) project. It includes all SA1s within a single SA2 region in New South Wales (NSW).\nThis dataset provides a spatial indicator of population vulnerability to extreme heat at the Statistical Area Level 1 (SA1), developed as part of the Heat Health Vulnerability case study within the AusUrb-HI project. The indicator captures three dimensions of vulnerability: exposure, sensitivity, and adaptive capacity. It integrates demographic profiles, environmental conditions, and urban morphology to map areas most at risk of heat-related health impacts. A comprehensive description of the methodology and outcomes is available in this report.\nThe AusUrb-HI project, led by AURIN, brings together expertise from QUT, RMIT, and UWA. It aims to enhance the understanding of urban health through spatial data assets across three themes: Cancer Determinants, Heat Health Vulnerability, and Urban Liveability &amp; Health. These indicators are designed to inform health professionals, planners, and policymakers in delivering targeted, climate-sensitive strategies to improve health and resilience in urban environments.\nThis dataset focuses on the NSW case study area, where linked hospital admissions data enabled validation of the HHVI. The index was developed using principal component analysis (PCA) on up to 44 input variables, with results produced for both the 2016 and 2021 census years. Multiple downscaling methods were tested, showing high internal consistency and strong correlation with the Australian Bureau of Statistics' Index of Relative Socio-economic Disadvantage (IRSD).\nThe linked health data used for validation was accessed through the Centre for Health Record Linkage (CHeReL) and analyzed in the Secure Unified Research Environment (SURE).\nThis dataset is intended to support evidence-based planning for climate resilience and public health. Each record includes values for exposure, sensitivity, adaptive capacity, and the combined index, along with variables used to derive these indices.",

    "description": "A predictive model has been established and tested to account for variations in the landscape to reflect changes in agricultural land capability class (on a progressive rating of 1: good - 7: poor). This dataset (and map) provides a prediction of the most likely land capability class to be expected in a particular location based on several layers of readily available information. These layers included geology, rainfall, slope, elevation, forest cover and surface drainage status. These data layers were input into a Geographic Information System modelling framework. Using previous experience and limited visits in the field, the output has been produced as a digital dataset and 1: 100,000 map. It was found to provide a relatively good impression of the landscapes potential for agricultural persuits (ie cropping and grazing). It was found to represent changes in capability class very well where geology, climate or slope control capability. In those areas where subsurface drainage controlled land capability it was found to be less reliable. Overall however as these areas of the State were previously devoid of any broadscale land resource information for this purpose - this map provides a valuable fist step in discerning land capability.",

    "description": "After nearly two years of monitoring, comprising 126.7 hours over 57 observations with the Parkes telescope and 49.4 hours across 101 observations with the FAST telescopes, we have determined that FRB 20220529 is an extremely active repeater. It exhibits one of the longest activity durations and a potential period. Due to frequent observations scheduled with both Parkes and FAST, we recently observed an abrupt rotation measure (RM) flare in this source. This is the first detection of such an <code>RM flare'' in a fast radio burst (FRB), suggesting that the source is in an environment with occasionally erupting coronal mass ejection. This presents a unique opportunity to study the eruption environment of FRBs and investigate the relation between burst activity and other burst parameters. If confirmed, the periodicity and the</code>RM flare'' of FRB 20220529 would corroborate each other and become a ``smoking gun'' of the binary origin of FRB. In our previous analysis, both Parkes and FAST observations have proven essential. While FAST's higher sensitivity has enabled the capture of many bursts, Parkes' wideband receiver has provided a good burst detection rate even during low-rate phases. Notably, during the RM flare, two high signal-to-noise ratio bursts from Parkes have been crucial in understanding the RM variations. To further investigate FRB 20220529, we have scheduled regular FAST observations every fortnight, monitoring the source for 20 minutes each time. Therefore, we also propose to monitor FRB 20220529 using the Parkes UWL receiver, ensuring high-time resolution and employing full-polarization observations.",

    "description": "In 2011 AAM was commissioned by the Commonwealth to fly an airborne laser scanning survey of Christmas Island. The provided 1km by 1km ESRI grids were stitched together using ESRI ArcMap 10 to form 2km by 2km tiles. In some cases the tiles are 3km by 2km to accomodate DEM grids with less than approximately 30% land cover. Using the software program ER Mapper 7.1, a wet look shiny colour drape algorthim and a HSI algorithm were applied to each of the 48 tiles.The colour range has been optimized for each individual tile to provide maximum information and clarity of features such as slopes, depressions, hills, cliffs and mining relics. A consequence of this is that colours may not match at adjoining edges.  The resulting images were saved as compressed ecw format.\n\nThe positional accuracy is the same as the accuracy of the 2011 digital elevation model. As a guide, the DEM data is vertically accurate to 15cm and horizontally accurate to 30cm.\n\n<a href=\"https://www.infrastructure.gov.au/utilities/disclaimer.aspx\">Disclaimer</a>",

    "description": "\n\n\n<strong>Moreton Bay City Flood Database</strong>\nRiver and Creek Flooding\nVersion 3.1.0 (October 2023)\nThis theme shows river and creek flooding caused by long duration heavy rainfall, typically lasting between 1 hour and 1 day. Sometimes this rain falls over a whole catchment or a number of catchments. This extended period of heavy rainfall causes the water levels in the river or creek to rise and escape the main channel. It may take a number of hours or days for these floodwaters to rise, reach a peak and then subside.&nbsp;\n<i>Existing Conditions Maximum Scenario:</i>&nbsp;Maximum of modelled flood behaviour in rivers and creeks for different design rainfall events under existing climate and catchment conditions&nbsp;- with and without structure (bridges and culverts) blockage.&nbsp;\n<i>Purpose</i>:&nbsp;To determine flood levels and flows for different design rainfall events for design of infrastructure&nbsp;with and without bridges and culverts being blocked by debris.\n<i>Methodology:</i>&nbsp;Coupled hydrologic (WBNM) and hydraulic (TUFLOW) modelling using a two-dimensional regular grid, 1D culvert structures, 2D bridge structures and a design burst rainfall approach&nbsp;based on Australian Rainfall and Runoff 2019 guideline (ARR2019). Blockage calculated based on ARR2019 recommendations.&nbsp;<i>Refer technical publications available from Council's website for further detail.</i>&nbsp;\n<i>Flood Height:&nbsp;</i>Indicates the approximate water surface level of potential inundation during a computer-modelled flood event, expressed in metres above mean sea level. This dataset represents the flood height values as contour lines using a contour interval of 0.2m.\n<i>Modelled Probability:</i>&nbsp;The dataset includes three possible flood events of different probability.\n<i>Likelihood: Likely</i><i>Annual Exceedance Probability (AEP): 5%</i><i>Average Recurrence Interval (ARI): 20 Year</i>\n<i>Likelihood:&nbsp;Possible</i><i>Annual Exceedance Probability (AEP):&nbsp;1%</i><i>Average Recurrence Interval (ARI):&nbsp;100 Year</i>\n<i>Likelihood: Unlikely</i><i>Annual Exceedance Probability (AEP): 0.1%</i><i>Average Recurrence Interval (ARI): 1,000 Year: 0.1% Chance of Flooding in Any One Year</i>\n<i>Version Notes&nbsp;3.1.0</i>&nbsp;- First edition of Generation 3 models, incorporating 2019 LiDAR, ARR2019 for Hydrology and TUFLOW HPC for Hydraulic modelling. All ARIs and all aspects. (BCR 5yr, 10yr, 50yr and 2000yr runs completed by CMB). BYR and MAR no structure blockage only. MAR ARR hazard calculated using WaterRIDE.

Model does not include underground structures however rainfall was scaled down to account for the possibility of some run-off being contained within the underground system. A post-process was applied to eliminate areas of shallow depth, low velocity and low velocity depth product. Additional removal of model errors and small property intersects using spatial analysis and manual techniques.<i>Existing Conditions Scenario:</i><strong>&nbsp;</strong>Modelled estimate of the extent of overland flow paths following a 1% Annual Exceedance Probability storm outside the river and creek flood extent and with some model errors and small property intersects removed.<i>Purpose:</i>&nbsp;To determine flood extent along overland flowpaths in areas outside the extent of the river and creek flood modelling. Suitable for public dissemination.<i>Flood Extent:</i><strong>&nbsp;</strong>Indicates the approximate extent of potential inundation during a computer-modelled flood event (not actual recorded levels). The inundation area may be less accurate where the property is flat near the outer limit of inundation, or where the ground surface has been modified since being surveyed.This dataset represents the flood extent as vector polygons without attribution.<i>Modelled Probability:</i><strong>&nbsp;</strong>The probability of flooding represented by this dataset is:&nbsp;1% Chance of Flooding in Any One Year<i>Likelihood:</i>&nbsp;Possible<i>Annual Exceedance Probability (AEP):</i>&nbsp;1%<i>Average Recurrence Interval (ARI):</i>&nbsp;100 YearA large uncommon flood event that is rarely observed but neverthess still possible. Over a long period of time an event of similar size may occur on average once every 100 years. It is therefore likely an event of this size will occur at least once during a single lifetime. It is less likely, but still possible, for a flood of this size to occur more than once in a single lifetime. A flood event of similar size occurred in the middle and upper reaches of the Caboolture River during January 2011.<i>Version Notes&nbsp;1.25.0 - Sub set of F01 Version 1.24 with areas removed where field Public = N in F00N Version 1.18.8 (April 2025)</i><i>Version Resolution: 1.0m</i><i>Data Reliability: D</i><i>Indicates that Council can only provide an extent but not levels as the flood data is of limited reliability</i>\n<i><strong>Further Information</strong></i><i>For additional information on flooding in the Moreton Bay Region please see Council's website </i><a href=\"https://www.moretonbay.qld.gov.au/Services/Property-Ownership/Flooding\">Flood information for residents of Moreton Bay - City of Moreton Bay</a>",

    "title": "TERN Weekly Pollen Count - Rocklea, Brisbane, Queensland 1994-1999",
    "description": "The datafile, published by the Terrestrial Ecosystem Research Network (TERN) contains the composition and abundance of airborne pollen in the suburb of Rocklea, Brisbane, Queensland, Australia. The data was collected for the period between June 1994 to May 1999 as part of a research program that assessed pollen bioaerosols and relationships with meteorological parameters (see Green BJ, Dettmann M, Rutherford S, Simpson RW [2002]. Airborne pollen of Brisbane, Australia: a five-year pollen record, 1994-1999. Grana 41(4):242-250.). This forms part of a study of the Australian Aerobiology working group (Haberle, Bowman, Newnham, Johnston, Beggs, Buters, Campbell, Erbas, Godwin, Green, Heute, Jaggard, Medek, Murray, Newbiggin, Thibaudon, Vicendese, Williamson, Davies “The macroecology of airborne pollen in Australian and New Zealand urban areas” ).\nAirborne pollen counts were derived from deployment of a seven-day Hirst-type volumetric pollen and spore trap and the instrument’s orifice elevated 2m above ground level. Several periods of motorized trap breakdown were experienced, but these were usually brief and accounted for a total of 117 days during the entire sampling period. The trap was calibrated to sample air at ten litres per minute and pollen was deposited onto tapes coated with a thin film of Dow Corning pressure-sensitive silicone adhesive (280A). The seven-day tapes were cut into daily lengths and mounted in Carberla’s solution on glass microscope slides. The entire surface area of each tape was scanned at magnifications of x250 using north +- south traverses and the pollen counts then converted to correspond to grains per m3 air as a daily mean value. The data is summed to provide an average weekly pollen count. Pollen identification was aided by reference to photomicrographs provided by Moss (1965), Grant Smith (1990), and Hjelmroos et al. (1999).\nFor more information please visit the Australian Centre for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis (ACEAS) Data Portal.\nPlease note: \n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data, acquired via the ACEAS Data Portal with permission from TERN.\n\n\nThis dataset allows you to filter the data by the date of collection.\n\n",

    "description": "A request was received in December, 1951, from the Director of Ordnance and Underwater Weapons of the Department of the Navy for assistance in selecting an area suitable for the electrical balance testing of the pistol-firing rod unit of the torpedo. It was desired that this site should be at the R.A.N. Torpedo Establishment at Neutral Bay, Sydney, New South Wales. The only condition laid down in the relevant specification is that \"the rod may be supported in a suitable wooden structure or in such other manner provided that the complete rod unit is not less than ten feet from any ferro-magnetic materials\". In order to arrive at a more specific definition of the requirements for the testing site, the problem was discussed with the Chief Superintendent and officers of the Torpedo Establishment. The appropriate test specifications were consulted and a series of measurements were carried out to determine the actual requirements. The magnetic investigations described in this report were carried out in August, 1952, and the overall results and conclusions were communicated verbally at that time to the officers concerned.",

The data shows business establishments with their trading name, industry (ANZSIC4) classification, location and CLUE block and small area allocation. The data covers the year period of 2010.\nA business establishment is defined as a \n\n\nCommercial occupant in a building\n\n\nSeparate land use\n\n\nAny permanent presence of economic activity in accordance with standard Industry classification (ANZSIC).\n\n\nHence, if one organisation has its presence in several buildings in the CLUE area, each time it will be counted as a separate establishment. Consequently, the count of establishments presented in CLUE represents the number of locations, rather than 'enterprises'.\nFor more information please visit the City of Melbourne CLUE Portal and ABS ANZSIC Page.\nPlease note: \n\n\nAURIN has acquired the data through the City of Melbourne Open Data Portal.\n\n\nThe individual yearly tables have been extracted from the archived 2002-2017 tables.\n\n\nThe data in this table is a snapshot and not live.\n\n",

    "description": "This dataset estimates human mobility through origin destination (OD) movement flow among the Statistical Area 2 (SA2) regions in Queensland (QLD), connected by public transport (PT) networks. The SA2 regions of Queensland connected by buses, trains, trams and ferries have been used to evaluate OD movement flows. The passenger OD movement data among different stations (or the station-based OD flow) are first estimated using a statistical estimation methodology. The stations-based OD flow data are then translated into region-based OD matrices using the state-of-art method. For more information please see the original metadata file here.\nHuman mobility data is a key ingredient in various areas and domains of research including epidemiology, policy and administration, criminology, transportation, logistics and supply chains, environmental management and, pollution and contamination. High quality human mobility data provided by telecommunication companies collected from call data records (CDRs) is available at prohibitive cost with restrictive licensing, keeping it out of reach for the majority of research community. On the other hand, there is an abundance of high-quality public data, reporting different aspects of mobility. Examples are the public transport patronage and information about the usage of the Australian road network. These datasets are collected by different organisations and government departments and are presented in various formats. For instance, data may be collected at different spatial (e.g. at state or postcode levels) and temporal scales and be presented in the form of passenger counts or aggregated movement flows. This dataset addresses the general lack of national scale comprehensive human mobility dataset in Australia by transforming available mobility data into a consistent format that is suitable for analysis in a broad range of research areas. Merging the various individual datasets into Australia's first comprehensive, national-scale human mobility data asset drastically improves the quality and coverage of existing datasets.\nThe Mobility Australia project received investment (https://doi.org/10.47486/DP702) from the Australian Research Data Commons (ARDC). The ARDC is funded by the National Collaborative Research Infrastructure Strategy (NCRIS).\nThe original data tables were structured in a matrix-like format. AURIN employed a methodology to merge diverse datasets into a comprehensive one, categorising based on transportation types (e.g., trains, buses, rails, ferries), years (e.g., 2019, 2020, 2021, etc.), and temporal scales (e.g., weekly, monthly, yearly). Subsequently, AURIN spatially enabled the original data by employing the 2021 edition of the Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS). The flow between origin and destination pairs is visually represented using line geometry.",

It looks at five domains of early childhood development: physical health and wellbeing (plus three health sub-domains), social competence, emotional maturity, language and cognitive skills, and communication skills and general knowledge.\nFor more information visit the AEDC website.\nPlease note suppression of AEDC data occurs when one or more of the following have been met:\n\n\nThree or fewer children had been assessed\n\n\nFewer than fifteen children had valid AEDC scores\n\n\nLess than two teachers had completed AEDC instruments for children in that location\n\n\nAEDC instruments were completed for less than 80% of all non special needs children\nAdditional minor suppression's have occurred where necessary to preserve confidentiality of related suppressed cells.\n\n\nPlease Note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data.\n\n\nAEDC results for Daly - Tiwi - West Arnhem (SA3 code 70203) and East Arnhem (SA3 code 70204) are combined in the original data. AURIN has assigned the results for these regions to the boundary of Daly - Tiwi - West Arnhem and excluded the boundary of East Arnhem from this dataset.\n\n",
