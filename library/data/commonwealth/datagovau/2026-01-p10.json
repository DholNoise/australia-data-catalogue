It can be easily mapped using the geometry column. \n\nTree canopy polygons have been derived by ArborCarbon from high-resolution airborne multispectral imagery. ArborCarbon collected this imagery using the ArborCam, a unique 11-band airborne multispectral camera system optimized for the accurate detection of vegetation and subtle changes in vegetation condition. \n\nThe high-resolution airborne imagery datasets were geometrically corrected and orthorectified using the City of Melbourne’s publicly available 2018 aerial imagery and a Digital Terrain Model supplied by the City. A Digital Surface Model was generated from the acquired imagery for the full extent of the City, enabling the stratification of vegetation into a range of height categories. All vegetation &gt;3m above the ground was classified as canopy (excluding vegetation on building rooftops).",

    "title": "Climate Vulnerability Assessment: Serrated Tussock",
    "description": "The Climate Vulnerability Assessment was designed to provide an overview of the impact of future climate change on all stages of production for the commodities and biosecurity risks assessed. The project used multicriteria analysis (MCA) models to produce assessments for the commodities and biosecurity risks in a consistent and comparable way, and a framework was developed to provide a rigorous, flexible and transparent process for assessing vulnerabilities and opportunities to climate change. Details of the approach and the climate data used in the assessments can be found in the Methodology Report which also details model exclusions and assumptions.\nAssessments were undertaken on commodities grouped into 6 nodes: Horticulture and Viticulture, Broadacre Cropping, Forestry, Extensive Livestock, Marine Fisheries, as well as for a set of biosecurity risks related to these primary industry sectors. The Summary Report gives details of the chosen commodities and biosecurity risks and summarises the high-level results.\nResults Reports for each commodity and biosecurity risk are being released. Visit the project's web pages to access these reports and for further information.\nThis dataset contains maps of modelled climate suitability for the serrated tussock model in the Biosecurity Risks node of the DPIRD Climate Vulnerability Assessment. Maps are provided (in GeoTIFF format) for each element of the model: the climate suitability for each season, climate suitability maps for each phenophase and also for each phenophase/climate variable combination in the model. Data is provided for each of the eight global climate models (GCMs) used in the project, as well as the climate suitability derived from historical observations, along with the ensemble median for each map.",

    "description": "This data release consists of flux tower measurements of the exchange of energy and mass between the surface and the atmospheric boundary-layer in semi-arid eucalypt woodland using eddy covariance techniques. It been processed using PyFluxPro (v3.3.0) as described in Isaac et al. (2017), <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-14-2903-2017\">https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-14-2903-2017</a>. PyFluxPro takes data recorded at the flux tower and process this data to a final, gap-filled product with Net Ecosystem Exchange (NEE) partitioned into Gross Primary Productivity (GPP) and Ecosystem Respiration (ER). For more information about the processing levels, see <a href=\"https://github.com/OzFlux/PyFluxPro/wiki\">https://github.com/OzFlux/PyFluxPro/wiki</a>.  \nThe Gingin site was established in June 2011 by CSIRO and is now managed by Edith Cowan University Centre for Ecosystem Management. The site is a natural woodland of high species diversity. The overstorey is dominated by Banksia spp. mainly B. menziesii, B. attenuata, and B. grandis with a height of around 7m and leaf area index of about 0.8. There are occasional stands of eucalypts and acacia that reach to 10m and have a denser foliage cover. There are many former wetlands dotted around the woodland, most of which were inundated all winter and some had permanent water 30 years ago. The watertable has now fallen below the base of these systems and they are disconnected and are no longer permanently wet. The fine sediments, sometimes diatomaceous, hold water and they have perched watertables each winter. There is a natural progression of species accompanying this process as they gradually become more dominated by more xeric species. The soils are mainly Podosol sands, with low moisture holding capacity. Field capacity typically about 8 to 10%, and in summer these generally hold less than 2% moisture. The water tabl is at about 8.5 m below the surface, and a WA Dept of water long-term monitoring piezometer is near the base of the tower. The instrument mast is 14m tall, with the eddy covariance instruments mounted at 14.8m. Fluxes of carbon dioxide, water vapour and heat are quantified with open-path eddy covariance instrumentation. Ancillary measurements include temperature, air humidity, wind speed and direction, precipitation, incoming and outgoing shortwave radiation, incoming and outgoing long wave radiation, incoming total and diffuse PAR and reflected PAR. Soil water content and temperature are measured at six soil depths. Surface soil heat fluxes are also measured. A COSMOS Cosmic ray soil moisture instrument is installed, along with a logged piezometer, and nested piezometers installed with short screens for groundwater profile sampling. To monitor the watertable gradient, piezometers will be installed 500 m esat and west of the tower. \nFor additional site information, see https://www.tern.org.au/tern-observatory/tern-ecosystem-processes/gingin-banksia-woodland-supersite/.

Data were processed using PyFluxPro (v3.4.15) as described by Isaac et al. (2017). PyFluxPro produces a final, gap-filled product with Net Ecosystem Exchange (NEE) partitioned into Gross Primary Productivity (GPP) and Ecosystem Respiration (ER).\n\nThe Cumberland Plain flux station is located in a dry sclerophyll forest. The Cumberland Plain Woodland is now an endangered ecological community that encompasses distinct groupings of plants growing on clayey soils. The canopy is dominated by <em>Eucalyptus moluccana</em> and <em>Eucalyptus fibrosa</em>, which host an expanding population of mistletoe. Average canopy height is 23&nbsp;m, the elevation of the site is 20&nbsp;m and mean annual precipitation is 800&nbsp;mm. \nFluxes of water vapour, carbon dioxide and heat are quantified with the open-path eddy flux technique from a 30&nbsp;m tall mast. Additional measurements above the canopy include temperature, humidity, wind speed and direction, rainfall, incoming and reflected shortwave and longwave radiation and net, diffuse and direct radiation and the photochemical reflectance index. In addition, profiles of humidity and CO2 are measured at eight levels within the canopy, as well as measurements of soil moisture content, soil heat fluxes, soil temperature, and 10&nbsp;hr fuel moisture dynamics. In addition, regular monitoring of understory species abundance, mistletoe infection, leaf area index and litterfall are also performed.",

    "description": "This dataset presents information and locations related to The Super Tuesday Bike Count event in Alice Springs for 2016. The counts are presented as individual points which relate to the location where the counts were undertaken by volunteers.\nThe Super Tuesday Bike Count collects annual figures of bicycle riders and their movements on roads and bike paths. Since 2007, Bicycle Network has conducted bicycle counts at key intersections and corridors selected by local governments. The data is available for researchers and policymakers to plan and build cycling infrastructure to promote increased cycling activity, and to gather longitudinal insights of cycling volumes and trends.\nSuper Tuesday count data is collected visually by volunteer counters at intersections along popular commuter routes, as well as subsidiary routes with lower rider volumes. The count is conducted in southern states (VIC, NSW, SA, WA) between 7:00-9:00am on the first Tuesday of March; and in northern states (QLD, NT) between 6:30-8:30am on the first Tuesday of September. Count locations are nominated by traffic engineers, transport planners, and other transport officers from participating councils. Counters record all movement directions, rider gender, and bicycle volume per fifteen-minute increments on standardised count sheets. \nFor more information please visit the Norther Territory Government Open Data Portal or view the Bicycle Network Super Tuesday Count Report.\nPlease note: \n\nWhere there was no data available (\"no data\", \"NA\", \"#N/A\" in the original data) the values have been set to NULL.\n",

    "title": "Picking apart the puzzle in arid groundwater systems, hydrochemical insights into the Darling Baaka River floodplain",
    "description": "As part of Geoscience Australia's Exploring for the Future Program, the Upper Darling–Baaka River Floodplain groundwater project has contributed to an improved understanding of hydrogeological systems of the Darling–Baaka River system in arid to semi-arid northwest New South Wales, a region where a lack of water security impacts communities, the environment, and limits economic opportunities. \n\nOne aspect of the project involved analysing groundwater and surface water hydrochemical data to assess aquifer characteristics, inter-aquifer and groundwater-surface water connectivity, as well as groundwater recharge and discharge dynamics. Sixty-eight groundwater and twenty-one surface or rainwater samples were collected. Selected sample suites were analysed for field parameters, major and trace ions, stable water isotopes (δ18O, δ2H, δ13CDIC), strontium isotopes (87Sr/86Sr), radiocarbon (14C), sulphur hexafluoride (SF6), chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), tritium (3H), chlorine isotopes (36Cl/Cl), noble gases (He, 3He/4He, Ne, Ar, Kr, Xe), and radon (222Rn). Statistical clustering analysis of this new data and legacy datasets identified three distinct hydrochemical facies: surface water and recently recharged low salinity groundwater, saline alluvial groundwater, and groundwater associated with aquifers of the Mesozoic Great Artesian Basin. Isotope and residence time tracer signatures revealed spatial differences in recharge, groundwater-surface water connectivity, and inter-aquifer connectivity between low salinity groundwater in hydraulic connection with the Darling–Baaka River, and the saline groundwater systems that characterise most of the alluvium throughout the study area.\n\nIntegrating this hydrochemical data with other geoscientific data provided new insights into hydrogeological processes relevant to key water management issues, including controls on the distribution of low salinity groundwater.\n\nPresented at the 52nd Congress of International Association of Hydrogeologists (IAH2025)",

Monitoring and evaluation was focused in seven Selected Areas: the Junction of the Warrego and Darling rivers, Gwydir river system, Lachlan river system, Murrumbidgee river system, Edward/Kolety-Wakool river system, Goulburn River and Lower Murray River. These areas will continue to be monitored through the CEWO’s Monitoring, Evaluation and Research (MER) Program.  \r\n\r\nData collected by monitoring at Selected Areas is used to evaluate local outcomes from watering and also contributed to the analysis and evaluation of Basin Plan objectives.\r\n\r\nPlease refer to the Murray-Darling Basin LTIM Project: 2018-19 Basin-scale evaluation of Commonwealth environmental water – Hydrology Report for the detailed method on data used for evaluation.  \r\n\r\n###Acknowledgement\r\n\r\nThe Commonwealth Environmental Water Office acknowledge the First Nations peoples as the Traditional Owners and Custodians of the lands, waterways and skies of the Murray-Darling Basin.

A surge in total number of tests performed on a particular day may occur as the test results are updated in batches and new laboratories gain testing capacity.  \nThe underlying dataset was assessed to measure the risk of identifying an individual and the level of sensitivity of the information gained if it was known that an individual was in the dataset.

    "description": "This data was collected in January/February 2012 by the IMOS Ship of Opportunity Underway CO2 Measurement research group on RV Aurora Australis (IMOS platform code: VNAA) voyage AA1112V3.\n\nDeparted: \tHobart, Tasmania,  January 05, 2012\nArrived:  Fremantle, Western Australia,  February 12, 2012\n\nCO2 System Overview:\nThe fugacity of carbon dioxide (fCO2) in surface seawater was measured using a General Oceanics Inc. automated system (Model 8050; Pierrot et al 2009). Seawater is sprayed into an equilibration chamber and CO2 in the headspace gas equilibrates with the seawater. The headspace gas is pumped through a thermoelectric condenser followed by a nafion drying tube before flowing through a Licor 7000 non-dispersive infrared gas analyser used to measure the CO2 mole fraction (XCO2) of the dried air. The gas flow is stopped temporarily for the CO2 measurements, which are made at atmospheric pressure. A set of four CO2 standards that cover the range of CO2 values expected in the ocean are analysed about every three hours to calibrate the gas analyser. Atmospheric XCO2 (dry) is measured after the standards by pumping clean outside air from an intake on the forward mast of the ship. \n\nSeawater intake and ancillary data:\nThe seawater intake is at about 6 m depth. A remote temperature sensor (Seabird Electronics SBE38) located at the intake is used to measure sea surface temperature (SST). Sea surface salinity is measured using a thermosalinograph (Seabird Electronics SBE21) mounted in the oceanographic lab next to the pCO2 system. The travel time between the intake and CO2 system is typically about 70 seconds with warming usually less than 0.7ºC in cold waters near freezing. The thermosalinograph water is from the same intake and supply line. \n\nMeteorological data, salinity, SST, and ships position and time are taken from the ship’s logging system.",

    "description": "The report is a quarterly report with a consistent and regular assessment of crop prospects for major field crops, forecasts of area, yield and production and a summary of seasonal conditions on a state by state basis. \r\n\r\n Key issues  • Favourable seasonal conditions in most cropping regions during spring boosted the production potential of crops, which were already in very good condition at the end of winter. \r\n• Rainfall in September was well above average in most regions in the eastern states (including South Australia). This resulted in plentiful supplies of soil moisture being available to crops during the critical period for grain development. However, in some areas, particularly in New South Wales, the September rainfall resulted in flooding and waterlogged crops, which adversely affected grain development. \r\n• In Western Australia, spring rainfall was average to slightly below average--but timely--and aided grain development. However, severe frosts adversely affected grain development in some growing regions. \r\n• Total winter crop production is forecast to rise by 32 per cent in 2016-17 to a record 52.4 million tonnes with higher production forecast for every state. This represents a 14 per cent upward revision from the forecast ABARES published in the September 2016 edition of Australian crop report. \r\n• For the major winter crops: wheat production is forecast to rise by 35 per cent to a record high of 32.6 million tonnes; barley production is forecast to rise by 24 per cent to a record high of 10.6 million tonnes; and canola production is forecast to rise by 22 per cent to 3.6 million tonnes, which would be the third-highest on record. \r\n• The Bureau of Meteorology indicated in its latest three-month rainfall outlook (December 2016 to February 2017), issued on 24 November 2016, that summer was likely to be drier and warmer than average. This should aid harvesting. \r\n• Total area planted to summer crops is forecast to rise by 15 per cent in 2016-17 to around 1.4 million hectares. Producers are expected to increase planted area in response to favourable levels of soil moisture early in the planting window and plentiful supplies of irrigation water. Total summer crop production is forecast to rise by 21 per cent in 2016-17 to around 4.6 million tonnes. \r\n• Australian cotton production is forecast to increase by 64 per cent in 2016-17 to around 1.0 million tonnes of cotton lint and around 1.5 million tonnes of cottonseed. This forecast largely reflects increased planted area, which is estimated to have almost doubled to 520 000 hectares. \r\n• Area planted to grain sorghum is forecast to fall by 31 per cent in 2016-17 to 471 000 hectares, the lowest in 24 years. This reflects higher expected returns from growing cotton. Grain sorghum production is forecast to fall by 29 per cent to 1.4 million tonnes. \r\n• Area planted to rice is forecast to increase almost fourfold in 2016-17 to 90 000 hectares in response to an increase in the supply of irrigation water available to rice growers. However, area planted to rice is expected to be constrained by the later than usual winter crop harvest in southern New South Wales. Rice production is forecast to rise to 916 000 tonnes, an increase of more than three times on the previous season. \r\n",

    "description": "This dataset presents the footprint of the number and per cent of women who gave birth and smoked tobacco during the first 20 weeks of pregnancy, by the mother's usual place of residence. The data spans the year of 2016 and is aggregated to 2015 Department of Health Primary Health Network (PHN) areas, based on the 2011 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nThe data is sourced from the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare (AIHW) National Perinatal Data Collection (NPDC). The NPDC began in 1991 and is a collaborative effort by the AIHW and state and territory health departments. Perinatal data are collected for each birth in each state and territory, usually by midwives and other birth attendants. The data are collated by the relevant state or territory health department and a standard de-identified extract is provided to the AIHW on an annual basis to form the NPDC. The NPDC covers both live births and stillbirths, where gestational age is at least 20 weeks or birth weight is at least 400 grams, except in Victoria and Western Australia, where births are included if gestational age is at least 20 weeks or, if gestation is unknown, birthweight is at least 400 grams.\nThe Mothers and Babies data accompanies the Australia's Mothers and Babies 2016 - In Brief Report.\nFor further information about this dataset, visit the data source: Australian Institute of Health and Welfare - Australia's Mothers and Babies 2016 Data Tables.\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data using the Department of Health - PHN Areas.\n\n\nPHN is derived from Statistical Area Level 2 (SA2) of the ABS Australian Statistical Geography Standard Edition 2011. Numbers may not sum to totals due to rounding error.\n\n\nExcludes mothers for whom smoking status in the first 20 weeks of pregnancy was 'Not stated' and mothers not usually resident in Australia or whose SA2 of usual residence was 'Not stated'.\n\n",

    "description": "The City of Melbourne has installed in-ground parking bay sensors in most CBD parking bays. These sensors record when a vehicle arrives and when it departs. Each record also includes the parking restriction for the bay and whether the vehicle has overstayed that restriction. This is the data for the 2013 calendar year\n\n\n\nKnown data issues: \n\n\n\n1. There are 987,179 records that have the text ‘OLD’ at the end of the restriction in the field named ‘Sign’. This has been investigated and determined the text refers to one of two things, either: \n\n\n\n· At the time of the parking event the restriction that has been captured is correct but when the data was extracted from the server (July 2017) the restriction had since changed. \n\n\n\n· (Or) The particular sensor has since been replaced. \n\n\n\n2. There are a number of records that have a negative value in the duration in field ‘seconds’. This occurs due to a sensor detecting an arrival time being after the departure time. \n\n\n\n3. There are a number of records where the arrival and departure times have not been recorded. If the time has not been recorded the time is calculated from midnight of the arrival day to either midnight of the departure day or to the departure time.\n\nDownload:\n\n<a href=\"https://opendatasoft-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/downloads/archive/7jq6-k9kf.zip\">Download</a> compressed CSV (1.24GB, 43.2 million rows)",

It replaces a previous dataset known as ‘BCT Agreements’ which was first released by the BCT in 2019.\nNSW PLC Agreements organises private protected areas into a single layer with geometric overlaps between different agreement types. The dataset spatially represents the boundaries of agreements made under the Biodiversity Conservation Act 2016 and preceding legislation. Individual Deeds of Agreement should be consulted for specific information about the extent of the subject land and legal obligations of the land owner.\nAgreements entered into under the BC Act are registered on the land title, binding current and successive landowners. Agreements established under preceding legislation may not be registered on title. \nThree agreement types are represented in the dataset (1) Biodiversity Stewardship Agreements (BSA) (formerly BioBanking agreements), (2) Conservation Agreements (CA), and (3) Wildlife Refuge Agreements (WRA). \nThe dataset is for internal use only, and is not for public distribution or display.",

    "title": "Catchment scale Land Use of Australia - Commodities - September 2017",
    "description": "This dataset has been superseded. An updated version of this dataset is available from the ABARES website.\r\n\r\nThis dataset is the first national compilation of catchment scale commodity data for Australia (CLUMC), current as at September 2017. It has been compiled from vector land use datasets collected as part of state and territory mapping programs through the Australian Collaborative Land Use and Management Program (ACLUMP). It complements the Catchment Scale Land Use of Australia - Update September 2017 dataset (ABARES 2017). Agricultural commodities are assigned to the Australian Land Use and Management (ALUM) Classification version 8 (ABARES 2016) classes based on; perceived intervention to the landscape, growing conditions and management, the intended use of the commodity, consistency with national and international reporting frameworks and standards, such as National Plantation Inventory, industry guidelines, Australian Bureau of Statistics, harmonised trade codes and ABARES commodity reports, where possible. \r\n\r\nCommodities data were produced as part of catchment scale land use mapping and primarily uses fine-scale satellite data and information collected in the field (ABARES 2011, 2015). Field validation was critical for mapping commodities. The date of mapping (2003 to 2017) and scale of mapping (1:5 000 to 1:250 000) vary, reflecting the source data, capture date and scale. \r\n\r\nJurisdictions captured commodity data (where possible) for those areas most recently mapped in the Catchment scale land use of Australia - Update September 2017 (ABARES 2017) with a focus on horticultural and intensive animal industries. Other commodities which are tertiary classes of the ALUM classification (such as sugar cane, cotton, rice, olives and grapes) have been mapped by jurisdictions for some time and are included in this dataset. Agricultural commodity level mapping is available for all of the Northern Territory, and is likely to be complete for the following commodities nationally: \r\n\r\n* Crops - rice, sugar cane, cotton\r\n* Fruit - bananas (except Southern Queensland), avocados, mangoes, olives, grapes\r\n* Nuts - macadamias\r\n* Livestock - dairy cattle, pigs, poultry, horse studs, aquaculture.\r\n\r\nCommodity information is selected from an agreed list of commodity names developed by ACLUMP partners. A commodity may be applied to one or many land use codes. For example the commodity 'wheat' is applied to class 3.3.1, 'Cropping' or 4.4.1, 'Irrigated cropping', while 'cattle' may be applied to any land use where cattle are observed including 2.1.0 'Grazing native vegetation', 3.2.0 'Grazing modified pastures', 4.2.0 'Grazing irrigated modified pastures', 5.2.2 'Feedlots' etc. \r\n\r\nThe commodity description is intended to add information to the catchment scale land use map which is not otherwise recorded in the ALUM Classification. Where there are several suitable commodity descriptions mappers are encouraged to record the most detailed description. For example when cattle breeds are known to be for milk production mappers would apply the commodity description 'cattle dairy' rather than just 'cattle'.\r\n",

It is intended to describe soil conditions for plant suitability and is not intended to be a literal map of watertable levels, which will change over time. Mapping shows the shallowest depth to watertable observed (provided it accounts for at least 30% of the map unit), while detailed proportion data are supplied for calculating respective areas of each depth to watertable class (spatial data statistics).",

    "description": "## **Abstract** \n\nThis dataset was derived by the Bioregional Assessment Programme. The parent datasets are identified in the Lineage field in this metadata statement. The processes undertaken to produce this dataset are described in the History field in this metadata statement.\n\n\n\nThis dataset is an updated version of the Galilee groundwater data October 2016.\n\n## **Dataset History** \n\nData from the following source datasheets within the QLD groundwater database were used: Registrations, Casing, Aquifer, Stratigraphy, Pump test and water levels. \n\nRelevant data was extracted from these source datasheets and compiled in new tab called  \"SWL Interp\".  Then the hydrostratigraphic interpretation from the original data compilation was incorporated into the \"SWL interp\" datasheet in the column called BA \"strat\". These interpretations are tagged in the \"strat interp source\" column as \"July14 SWL\" . For completeness the original interpretation is included in the datasheet called \"July14SWL\"\n\n\n\nThe focus of these updated interpretation were bores that may be screened in aquifers in the Galilee Basin. Bores that were interpreted utilising the updated data are tagged in the \"strat interp source\" column as \"Mar17 interp\". This latest version includes some minor refinements to the stratigraphic interpretation, and includes a new column (Company), which identifies if a bore forms part of a company monitoring bore network.\n\n## **Dataset Citation** \n\nBioregional Assessment Programme (2017) Galilee groundwater data October 2016 v2.

    "description": "Vicmap Address is Victoria's authoritative geocoded database of property address points.  The data includes predominately, but not exclusively, locational property address identifiers assigned by Local Government, considered to be the primary creator and custodian of property address.  If accessible, other 'real life' property addresses created and used by the community, but not recognized by Local Government including retirement villages, assisted care facilities, industrial and public housing estates etc. are included. The 2011/2012 audit against Local Government addressing revealed a 97.41% match rate, increased from 92.43% in 2008/2009 following the 2009 Address Completion Initiative. Key validation fields are 'source' and 'source_verified', respectively indicating the address source and date last validated against that source. The minimum address attributes required for a property address to be included in Vicmap Address are road name and locality. However, the principal address details include the unit/house number(s), road name (including any type or suffix) and locality (town/suburb/rural district). Vicmap Address is jointly maintained with Vicmap Property (VMPROP), with every address relating to a VMPROP  record, joined through a property_pfi link. Many additional attributes are included, where available, to facilitate use and relevance to the user community.\nN.B. Specifically excluded are non-property related, and electronic address details such as email, post office (PO) boxes, roadside delivery points (RSD's), roadside mail boxes (RMB's) and the like.\nCurrent data model: Version 6.1 (Oct 2016)",

    "description": "This dataset presents the Rental Affordability Index (RAI) for 3 bedroom dwellings. The data uses a single median income value for all of Australia (enabling comparisons across regions), and spans the quarters Q1 2011 to Q2 2021. The RAI covers all states with available data, the Northern Territory does not form part of this dataset.\nNational Shelter, Bendigo Bank, The Brotherhood of St Laurence, and SGS Economics and Planning have released the RentalAffordability Index (RAI) on a biannual basis since 2015. Since 2019, the RAI has been released annually.\nIt is generally accepted that if housing costs exceed 30% of a low-income household's gross income, the household is experiencing housing stress (30/40 rule). That is, housing is unaffordable and housing costs consume a disproportionately high amount of household income. The RAI uses the 30 per cent of income rule. Rental affordability is calculated using the following equation, where 'qualifying income' refers to the household income required to pay rent where rent is equal to 30% of income: \nRAI = (Median income ∕ Qualifying Income) x 100\nIn the RAI, households who are paying 30% of income on rent have a score of 100, indicating that these households are at the critical threshold for housing stress. A score of 100 or less indicates that households would pay more than 30% of income to access a rental dwelling, meaning they are at risk of experiencing housing stress.\nFor more information on the Rental Affordability Index please refer to SGS Economics and Planning.\nThe RAI is a price index for housing rental markets. It is a clear and concise indicator of rental affordability relative to household incomes, applied to geographic areas across Australia. \nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data using geometries provided by SGS Economics and Planning. Values of 'NA' in the original data have been set to NULL.",

The data will support work being done in the bay by James Cook University researchers.\n\nThe unit will be serviced every six months and will be used in the future for attaching new sets of sensors.",

    "description": "In March 2003, banks and selected Registered Financial Corporations (RFCs) began reporting their international assets, liabilities and country exposures to APRA in ARF/RRF 231 International Exposures. This return is the basis of the data provided by Australia to the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) for its International Banking Statistics (IBS) data collection. APRA ceased the RFC data collection after September 2010.\r\n\r\nThe IBS data are based on the methodology described in the BIS Guide on International Financial Statistics (see http://www.bis.org/statistics/intfinstatsguide.pdf; Part II International banking statistics). Data reported for Australia, and other countries, on the BIS website are expressed in United States dollars.\r\n\r\nData are recorded on an end-quarter basis.\r\n\r\nThere are two sets of IBS data: locational data, which are used to gauge the role of banks and financial centres in the intermediation of international capital flows; and consolidated data, which can be used to monitor the country risk exposure of national banking systems. Only locational data are reported in this statistical table.  \r\n\r\nData are shown for a range of countries and regions. Similar data for a selected group of countries are also available in B12.2.\r\n\r\nCountry and regional groupings are based on the classification used in the IBS.\r\n\r\nSome liabilities are reported at market value, but contractual or nominal values are used where market values are not appropriate.\r\n\r\nThis statistical table contains seven data worksheets. Six present data for countries within each specified region, while the 'Summary' worksheet shows total international liabilities of Australian-located banks (and RFCs between March 2003 and September 2010) for each region, and Australia. In each of these worksheets, the data in the last column measures total international liabilities for the region. Total international liabilities for each country add to total international liabilities for the region. However, in some quarters, this cannot be directly verified because data for individual countries and regions have blank entries in order to avoid disclosing confidential bank exposures.\r\n\r\nIn the 'Summary' worksheet, the positions by region are summed to produce a ‘Total non-residents’ figure that represents reporting entities’ total positions with offshore counterparties in all currencies. The positions shown for 'Australia' are positions with residents in foreign currency.\r\n",

    "description": "North Keeling - Orthophoto - 2011\n\nIn 2011 AAM Pty Ltd was commissioned by the Commonwealth to obtain orthophotography of the Cocos (Keeling) Islands. Between the 8th and 16th of August 2011 orthophotography was obtained for the entire extent of the islands (including North Keeling Island) by AAM Pty Ltd using a fixed-wing light aircraft. Previously, aerial photography was captured for Cocos (Keeling) Islands in 1987 and satellite imagery in 2004. The 2011 imagery has a 15cm on ground pixel size resolution, an improvement on all previous imagery.\n\nUsing an automated process, raw images were joined to form two mosaics, one of the Cocos southern lagoon and one of North Keeling Island. Colour balancing and replacement of certain areas with alternate raw images was performed for consistency. As a guide, the orthophotography is horizontally accurate to 30cm.\n\nThe orthophotography was provided to Geoscience Australia in UTM WGS 47S. All imagery was captured using a DiMAC UltraLight 50mm Lens camera within approximately 2 hours of low tide. During this period tides ranged from 0.4m to 1.3m. Flying height was around 800 meters with flight line spacing of around half a kilometre. The clarity and resolution is an improvement on the 2006 satellite imagery.\n\n<a href=\"https://www.infrastructure.gov.au/utilities/disclaimer.aspx\">Disclaimer</a>",

    "description": "This datasets presents smooth values of the number of people in the labour force of Local Government Area (LGA) regions for each quarter starting December 2010 up to June 2018. The boundaries used for the dataset follow the 2018 edition of the Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nSmall Area Labour Markets presents regional estimates of unemployment and the unemployment rate at two small area levels:\n\n\nFor approximately 2,100 Australian Bureau of Statistics’ (ABS) Statistical Area Level 2s (SA2s), on a State/Territory and Metropolitan/Non-metropolitan basis; and\n\n\nFor each of Australia’s 540 Local Government Areas (LGAs).\n\n\nThe estimates in Table 1 and 2 are smoothed using a four-quarter average to minimise the variability inherent in small area estimates. A description of the methodology used to prepare the estimates in this publication is presented in the Explanatory Notes, as well as on page 43 of the PDF Publication.\nPlease note: \n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data.\n\n\nWhere data values were \"-\" (no data provided) in the original data they have been set to null.\n\n\nCaution: Highly disaggregated estimates of unemployment and the unemployment rate at the SA2 and LGA level can display significant variability and should be viewed with caution. Indeed, quarter-to-quarter comparisons may not be indicative of actual movements in the labour market. It is therefore recommended that year-on-year comparisons be used.\n\n",

    "description": "Data describes habitat suitability modelling (HSM) results for macroinvertebrates in streams. The data was developed by University of Melbourne through the Melbourne Waterways Research Practice Partnership as part of the development of Melbourne Water’s Healthy Waterways Strategy 2018 (HWS2018). Analysis has been undertaken across the Melbourne Water operating region, where the operating region has been divided into 16,346 sub-catchments. Of these 16,346 subcatchments, 8233 contain Melbourne Water waterways. The results are presented for each of these 8233 reaches. The data was used to estimate the scores for macroninvertebrates presented in the HWS for three scenarios:Current: habitat suitability under current conditions (i.e. 2014).Current trajectory: habitat suitability under urbanisation and climate change scenarios if current management approaches continue.Target trajectory: habitat suitability given urbanisation and climate change (as for current trajectory), together with (a) delivery of performance objectives of the Healthy Waterways Strategy and (b) achievement of environmental condition scores as described in the Catchment Programs of the Healthy Waterways Strategy.Data has also been captured for a range of modelled HSM scenarios involving revegetation, stormwater management and climate change. Primary purpose is for waterways planning and analysis.Habitat Suitability Model results have been thoroughly reviewed and are considered fit for purpose (i.e. for waterway planning). This data set covers the entire Melbourne Water region with the exception of very small areas close to Port Phillip Bay or Western Port. For example, there are small areas of French Island which are not captured.This data set was created using: 1. Streams dataset for the Healthy Waterways Strategy 2018. This layer was developed by GraceGIS using Melbourne Water layers as inputs. 2. Results from Habitat Suitability Modelling for the Healthy Waterways Strategy 2018. Further reading: Chee et al.

    "description": "This data release consists of flux tower measurements of the exchange of energy and mass between the surface and the atmospheric boundary-layer in semi-arid eucalypt woodland using eddy covariance techniques. It been processed using PyFluxPro (v3.3.3) as described in Isaac et al. (2017), <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-14-2903-2017\">https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-14-2903-2017</a>. PyFluxPro takes data recorded at the flux tower and process this data to a final, gap-filled product with Net Ecosystem Exchange (NEE) partitioned into Gross Primary Productivity (GPP) and Ecosystem Respiration (ER). For more information about the processing levels, see <a href=\"https://github.com/OzFlux/PyFluxPro/wiki\">https://github.com/OzFlux/PyFluxPro/wiki</a>.\n   \nThe Cow Bay flux station was established in December 2008 and managed by James Cook University. The forest is classified as complex mesophyll vine forest, there are 94 species in the core 1Ha, and average tree height is 22m. Elevation of the site is 90m and mean annual precipitation is 3935mm. The Daintree Rainforest is one of the most biodiverse forests in Australia.The instruments are mounted on a walk-up tourist tower at 35m. Fluxes of heat, water vapour and carbon dioxide are measured using the open-path eddy flux technique. Supplementary measurements above the canopy include temperature, humidity, windspeed, wind direction, rainfall, incoming and reflected shortwave radiation and net radiation.The early years 2009 - 12 had several data gaps. Shadowing of the radiometric equipment continues to cause artifacts on the radiometers - these can be seen as reduction in downwelling radiation with solar inclination. The site is part of the FNQ Rainforest SuperSite - associated with the Daintree node, which is part of the TERN Australian SuperSite Network (ASN). \nFor additional site information, see https://supersites.tern.org.au/supersites/fnqr-daintree .",

    "description": "This dataset presents the footprint of the percentage of adults who saw a dentist, hygienist or dental specialist in the preceding 12 months. The data spans the years of 2013-2017 and is aggregated to 2015 Department of Health Primary Health Network (PHN) areas, based on the 2011 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nThe data is sourced from the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) 2016-17 Patient Experience Survey, collected between 1 July 2016 and 30 June 2017. It also includes data from previous Patient Experience Surveys conducted in 2013-14, 2014-15 and 2015-16. The Patient Experience Survey is conducted annually by the ABS and collects information from a representative sample of the Australian population. The Patient Experience Survey is one of several components of the Multipurpose Household Survey, as a supplement to the monthly Labour Force Survey. The Patient Experience Survey collects data on persons aged 15 years and over, who are referred to as adults for this data collection.\nFor further information about this dataset, visit the data source:Australian Institute of Health and Welfare - Patient experiences in Australia Data Tables.\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data using the Department of Health - PHN Areas.\n\n\nPercentages are calculated based on counts that have been randomly adjusted by the ABS to avoid the release of confidential data.\n\n\nAs an indication of the accuracy of estimates, 95% confidence intervals were produced. These were calculated by the ABS using standard error estimates of the proportion.\n\n\nSome of the patient experience measures for 2016-17 have age-standardised rates presented. Age-standardised rates are hypothetical rates that would have been observed if the populations studied had the same age distribution as the standard population.\n\n\nCrude rates are provided for all years. They should be used for understanding the patterns of actual service use or level of experience in a particular PHN.\n\n\nThe Patient Experience Survey excludes persons aged less than 15 years, persons living in non-private dwellings and the Indigenous Community Strata (encompassing discrete Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities).\n\n\nData for Northern Territory should be interpreted with caution as the Patient Experience Survey excluded the Indigenous Community Strata, which comprises around 25% of the estimated resident population of the Northern Territory living in private dwellings.\n\n\nNP - Not available for publication. The estimate is considered to be unreliable. Values assigned to NP in the original data have been set to null.\n\n",

    "title": "SAIMOS - Biological and Flow Cytometry data collected from CTD stations in South Australia, in March 2010",
    "description": "Flow cytometry data was collected in March 2010, in waters off South Australia. \nThe general purpose of the study is to be able to establish background knowledge on the ecosystem on the continental shelf of South Australia and the impact of upwelling/saline outflow events on microbial communities to ultimately develop a biogeochemical model of the region. Sampling was carried out during cruises conducted on board the RV Ngerin as part of the Southern Australian Integrated Marine System (SAIMOS). During each cruise, the physical, chemical and biological properties of the chlorophyll fluorescence maximum (FM) layer were investigated. Flow cytometry data has been collected for picophytoplankton, bacteria and viruses.\n\nSix main stations have been sampled over the course of the study, five are located on the 100 m isobath, i.e. RS (35.508S, 136.278E), B2 (35.418S, 136.148E), B3 (35.258S, 136.048E), B4 (35.168S, 135.418E) and B5 (35.008S, 135.198E), and one from an offshore station (B1; 36.188S, 136.178E) located southwest of Kangaroo Island. Note that combining the distances between stations (14–25 nautical miles), the average component of the current velocity at middepth along the shelf (0.01 m s21) and the average speed of the vessel (i.e. 9 knots) indicate that different water masses were sampled at each station. Additional samples have on occasion been collected from the National Reference Station (NRS) at Kangaroo Island (35.832S, 136.447E) and the SA Spencer Gulf Mouth Mooring (SAM8SG, 35.25S, 136.690E), where the saline outflow occurs.",

    "description": "This dataset estimates human mobility through origin destination (OD) movement flow among the Statistical Area 2 (SA2) regions in Queensland (QLD), connected by public transport (PT) networks. The SA2 regions of Queensland connected by buses, trains, trams and ferries have been used to evaluate OD movement flows. The passenger OD movement data among different stations (or the station-based OD flow) are first estimated using a statistical estimation methodology. The stations-based OD flow data are then translated into region-based OD matrices using the state-of-art method. For more information please see the original metadata file here.\nHuman mobility data is a key ingredient in various areas and domains of research including epidemiology, policy and administration, criminology, transportation, logistics and supply chains, environmental management and, pollution and contamination. High quality human mobility data provided by telecommunication companies collected from call data records (CDRs) is available at prohibitive cost with restrictive licensing, keeping it out of reach for the majority of research community. On the other hand, there is an abundance of high-quality public data, reporting different aspects of mobility. Examples are the public transport patronage and information about the usage of the Australian road network. These datasets are collected by different organisations and government departments and are presented in various formats. For instance, data may be collected at different spatial (e.g. at state or postcode levels) and temporal scales and be presented in the form of passenger counts or aggregated movement flows. This dataset addresses the general lack of national scale comprehensive human mobility dataset in Australia by transforming available mobility data into a consistent format that is suitable for analysis in a broad range of research areas. Merging the various individual datasets into Australia's first comprehensive, national-scale human mobility data asset drastically improves the quality and coverage of existing datasets.\nThe Mobility Australia project received investment (https://doi.org/10.47486/DP702) from the Australian Research Data Commons (ARDC). The ARDC is funded by the National Collaborative Research Infrastructure Strategy (NCRIS).\nThe original data tables were structured in a matrix-like format. AURIN employed a methodology to merge diverse datasets into a comprehensive one, categorising based on transportation types (e.g., trains, buses, rails, ferries), years (e.g., 2019, 2020, 2021, etc.), and temporal scales (e.g., weekly, monthly, yearly). Subsequently, AURIN spatially enabled the original data by employing the 2021 edition of the Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS). The flow between origin and destination pairs is visually represented using line geometry.",

    "description": "\n## **Abstract** \nThis dataset was compiled by the Geological and Bioregional Assessment Program from source data referenced within the dataset and/or metadata. Effective environmental impact assessment (EIA) relies on rigorous scientific assessment of all potential causal pathways by which large-scale developments may impact on valued assets in a region. Despite their importance to decision-making, many EIAs are flawed by incomplete analysis of causal pathways, limited spatial assessment and a lack of transparency about how risks have been evaluated across the region. To address these, we developed an EIA methodology based on network analysis of potential causal pathways in a given region. This network approach is coupled with a systematic evaluation of the likelihood, consequence and mitigation options for each causal pathway from one or more human activities to multiple valued assets. The method includes analysis of the confidence in these evaluations, recognizing where knowledge gaps constrain assessments of risks to particular assets. The causal network approach is complemented by a spatially explicit analysis of the region that allows residual risk (i.e. risk remaining after all feasible mitigations) to be mapped for all valued assets. This identifies which activities could lead to potential impacts of varying concern (rated from ‘very low’ to ‘very 21 high’), their likely pathways, which valued assets are at risk and where these residual risks are greatest. The output maps reveal ‘risk hotspots’ where more detailed local-scale assessments and monitoring should focus. This dataset contains the spreadsheets describing the causal network for the Beetaloo region and the spatial grids evaluating likelihood, consequence and mitigation. The dataset also contains a spreadsheet summarising the results and all output grids with the level of concern.\n\n\n## **Attribution** \nGeological and Bioregional Assessment Program\n\n\n## **History** \nThis dataset has the input spreadsheet describing the nodes and links in the Beetaloo causal network (BEE_input.xlsx) and the spreadsheet summarizing the results of the spatial causal network analysis (BEE_output.xlsx). The dataset also contains all the grids associated with the link evaluations (grids/input) as geotiff files. The filename corresponds to the entries in the gridname column in the input spreadsheet. The dataset also contains the output grids as geotiff files. These are stored in the directory grids/outputs, organised in a directory per endpoint. Each of these directories contains: 1. a png file of the subnetwork of links leading to that endpoint, 2. the overall impact grid (geotiff), 3. a heatmap of number of processes of concern for each endpoint (geotiff) and three subdirectories (activity, stressor, process) of the impact grids of the causal pathways that contain the activity, stressor or process.",

    "description": "Fiddler crabs are not generally considered subjects for the study of monogamy as they tend to live in dense mixed sex colonies with numerous neighbours and individually defended territories. Here, a series of experiments have been conducted demonstrating the unique relationship between neighbouring males and females in the species Uca capricornis. These experiments illustrate that this species of fiddler crab is socially monogamous. Six experiments were conducted in relation to this investigation in the East Point Reserve, Darwin from November to January in 2002-2006: \n\n1) Natural male-female interactions and territoriality - Twenty-one pairs were filmed from overhead for a period of 30 minutes. Any activity was noted, as was any interactions with intruders. Territoriality was also examined, providing the overall area covered by the crabs within the half hour. By aligning the male and female territories with their respective burrows it was possible to determine the area overlap between them. \n\n2) Sex ratio and distribution - The purpose of this experiment was to determine whether females may be a limited resource within a population of Uca capricornis. The sex ratio in relation to size was determined. The location of burrows was also recorded to determine whether the males and females were distributed independently of each other. The distance to, and sex of, the nearest resident for each individual was also measured to compare mean distances between male-female neighbours and between male-male neighbours.\n\n3) Burrow tenure -To determine whether male-female pairs were longer lasting than male-male pairs, we documented the number of crabs that were still present in their same burrow after 24 hours. \n\n4) 'Neighbour' and 'stranger' relations - This experiment was designed to demonstrate how a male fiddler crab responds to different individuals tethered near to his burrow. The response of a male crab to the neighbour and a stranger (with similar physical characteristics) was observed.\n\n5) Response of paired crabs when faced with intruders of differing sex. This experiment was designed to determine if males and females are unable to associate with multiple partners because their partners aggressively repel same-sex intruders. \n\n6) Size-assortative mating -This experiment was designed to examine whether the nearest female or male neighbour was correlated with the size of a focal male. This investigation was based upon data collected during the other experiments.",

That is construction is completed in blocks, so that there may be large upward jumps in some weeks and less or none in others. Following completion of the construction process passing premises in the streets, further validation of address data is undertaken of the ‘as-built’ network against estimates obtained from national address data. There may be some fluctuation in numbers from week to week as a result.\r\n\r\nThe data is also available in a PDF on our website:\r\nhttps://www.nbnco.com.au/corporate-information/about-nbn-co/corporate-plan/weekly-progress-report\r\n\r\n__The Weekly Progress Report (Build) is currently being reviewed by NBN Co for any impacts of the global equipment and component shortage on the nbn™ HFC network. Publishing of the next Weekly Progress Report (Build) will resume as soon as possible.__\r\n",

    "description": "## **Abstract** \n\nThe dataset was derived by the Bioregional Assessment Programme from multiple source datasets. The source datasets are identified in the Lineage field in this metadata statement. The processes undertaken to produce this derived dataset are described in the History field in this metadata statement. \n\n\n\nAs suggested by its title, the file provides the domain boundary where a groundwater model will be constructed for the Clarence-Moreton bioregion.\n\n## **Purpose** \n\nIt's created to limit the groundwater model extent.\n\n## **Dataset History** \n\nThe model domain extent and its boundaries were defined based on the following criteria:\n\n\\*\tThe model's outermost boundaries were placed far enough from the coal seam development area, such that they do not interfere with  the modelling results, that is, it eliminates boundary effects.;\n\n\\*\tModel boundaries should follow existing geological and/or hydrological boundaries.;\n\n\\*\tImportant receptors within and/or close to the development area should be within the areal extents of the groundwater model.\n\n## **Dataset Citation** \n\nBioregional Assessment Programme (2015) CLM Groundwater Model Boundary.

In cases where a partial surrender was approved during the term of the lease, only the final area is represented in this dataset.\nMining Lease polygons delineate areas in which lease holders are permitted to conduct mining operations. Mining Leases may be granted over both Crown and private land, so long as that land falls under the Mineral Resources Development Act 1995. Mining operations include: obtaining and treating minerals, storing and containing minerals or waste material generated on a lease or another area, and activities associated with mining. Mining also includes production activities in relation to a category 4 mineral or a category 6 mineral.",

Data were processed using PyFluxPro (v3.4.18) as described by Isaac et al. (2017). PyFluxPro produces a final, gap-filled product with Net Ecosystem Exchange (NEE) partitioned into Gross Primary Productivity (GPP) and Ecosystem Respiration (ER).\n\nFletcherview Tropical Rangeland SuperSite was established in 2021 at James Cook University’s Fletcherview Research Station, a fully operational outback cattle station located 50&nbsp;km west of Townsville, Queensland. The site is used for cattle grazing and is characterised by tall open savanna. The vegetation is dominated by native grasses such as blackspear and kangaroo grasses, as well as introduced species like buffel grass, signal grass and leucaena. Fletcherview typically experiences a dry and wet season, with most rainfall occurring between January and April.",

    "title": "Potential Groundwater Dependent Ecosystem (GDE) Mapping for the Glenelg Hopkins CMA",
    "description": "Potential Groundwater Dependent Ecosystems (GDE) are ecosystems identified within the landscape as likely to be at least partly dependent on groundwater. State-wide screening analysis was performed to identify locations of potential terrestrial GDEs, including wetland areas. The GDE mapping was developed utilising satellite remote sensing data, geological data and groundwater monitoring data in a GIS overlay model. Validation of the model through field assessment has not been performed. The method has been applied for all of Victoria and is the first step in identifying potential groundwater dependent ecosystems that may be threatened by activities such as drainage and groundwater pumping. The dataset specifically covers the Glenelg Hopkins Catchment Management Authority (CMA) area. The method used in this research is based upon the characteristics of a potential GDE containing area as one that:\n1. Has access to groundwater. By definition a GDE must have access to groundwater. For GDE occurrences associated with wetlands and river systems the water table will be at surface with a zone of capillary extension. In the case of terrestrial GDE's (outside of wetlands and river systems), these are dependent on the interaction between depth to water table and the rooting depth of the vegetation community.\n2. Has summer (dry period) use of water. Due to the physics of root water uptake, GDEs will use groundwater when other sources are no longer available; this is generally in summer for the Victorian climate. The ability to use groundwater during dry periods creates a contrasting growth pattern with surrounding landscapes where growth has ceased.\n3. Has consistent growth patterns, vegetation that uses water all year round will have perennial growth patterns.\n4. Has growth patterns similar to verified GDEs. \nThe current mapping does not indicate the degree of groundwater dependence, only locations in the landscape of potential groundwater dependent ecosystems. This dataset does not directly support interpretation of the amount of dependence or the amount of groundwater used by the regions highlighted within the maps. Further analysis and more detailed field based data collection are required to support this.\n\nThe core data used in the modelling is largely circa 1995 to 2005. It is expected that the methodology used will over estimate the extent of terrestrial GDEs. There will be locations that appear from EvapoTranspiration (ET) data to fulfil the definition of a GDE (as defined by the mapping model) that may not be using groundwater. Two prominent examples are: 1. Riparian zones along sections of rivers and creeks that have deep water tables where the stream feeds the groundwater system and the riparian vegetation is able to access this water flow, as well as any bank storage contained in the valley alluvials. 2. Forested regions that are accessing large unsaturated regolith water stores.\nThe terrestrial GDE layer polygons are classified based on the expected depth to groundwater (ie shallow &lt;5 m or deep &gt;5 m). Additional landscape attributes are also assigned to each mappnig polygon.\n\nIn 2011-2012 a species tolerance model was developed by Arthur Rylah Institute, collaborating with DPI, to model landscapes with ability to support GDEs and to provide a relative measure of sensitivity of those ecosystems to changes in groundwater availability and quality. Rev 1 of the GDE mapping incorporates species tolerance model attributes for each potential GDE polygon and attributes for interpreted depth to groundwater.\n\nSeparate datasets and associated metadata records have been created for GDE species tolerance.",

    "description": "\n## **Abstract** \nThis dataset contains the hydrochemical and environmental tracer data of a fortnightly time series and event-driven precipitation data between October 2019 and March 2021 created as part of the Geological and Bioregional Assessment Program (GBA) stage 3 in the Beetaloo Sub-basin. A total of 28 spring samples were collected and analysed for a number of parameters including hydrochemistry (major and minor ions) and the environmental tracers 222Rn, 18O, 2H. Samples are from Bitter Spring (2 locations), Rainbow Spring and Fig Tree Spring at Mataranka. Further 19 rainwater samples were taken at the ranger station in Mataranka and analysed for 18O & 2H. The data showed the variability of Fig-Tree Spring indicating that part of the water discharging is sourced from a swampy upstream area and flows to the spring along a short flow distance. Bitter Spring and Rainbow Spring show steady values hardly influenced by seasons and therefore have mean residence times above 4-5years. Significant values of helium above solubility equilibrium also indicate the presence of an older component, probably circulating on the time scale of centuries.\n\n\n## **Attribution** \nGeological and Bioregional Assessment Program\n\n\n## **History** \nSamples were taken by Mataranka Rangers and sent by post to CSIRO Waite Campus, Adelaide for 222Rn measurement and to CDU in Darwin for 18O, 2H and hydrochemistry measurement. Alkalinity was measured by titration. Stable isotopes 2H and 18O of water were measured on a Picarro Cavity-Ring Down Laser Spectrometer, are calibrated versus VSMOW and given in the usual delta notation. Anions were measured by ion chromatography and cations by ICP-OES. Radon extraction followed the procedure outlined in Leaney & Herczeg (2006) and measurements were done using Liquid Scintillation Spectroscopy on a Quantulus Counter. Data are reported as measured without further post-processing.",

The data is based on the recipient's geocoded address aggregated by Local Government Area (LGA) from the Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS) 2013.\nThe Department of Social Services (DSS) is the Australian Government's lead agency in the development and delivery of social policy, and is working to improve the lifetime wellbeing of people and families in Australia. DSS' policies and services respond to need across people's lives - looking after families, children and older people; providing a safety net for people who cannot fully support themselves; enhancing the wellbeing of people with high needs; assisting people who need help with care; and supporting a diverse and harmonious society. DSS supports people and families in Australia by encouraging independence and participation, and supporting a cohesive society.\nFor more information on this dataset please visit the Australian Government Open Data.\nFor further details on payments, see 'A guide to Australian Government payments'.\nPlease note:\n\n\nIn order to protect individuals' privacy, identified populations between 1 and 19 have been suppressed and replaced with '&lt;20' for confidentiality purposes. Additional data may be suppressed and replaced with 'n.p.' (not provided) to prevent the derivation of identified populations that have values of less than 20.\n\n\nIndividuals who live overseas, individuals who are without a valid home address and individuals who only have a postal address cannot be assigned to a locational boundary. State/territory totals derived from Local Government Area data will not match actual state and territory totals, due to different statistical geography methodologies.\n\n\nCaveats specific to payments type can be found in the relevant payment description of the original data.\n\n\nAURIN has spatialised this dataset and have made the following replacements to enforce data type consistency: \n\n\n'&lt;20' has been assigned a value of '-1' within the data\n\n\nA boolean field has been created for each data field to flag left-censored data. 'True' is assigned to fields that have been censored.\n\n\n'n.p.' (not provided) has been set to Null within the data.\n\n",

    "description": "Data compiled within this feature class is combined extent of the nominated Hunter Valley Remnant Woodlands and Open Forests found across the Lower Hunter region (Cessnock, Newcastle, Lake Macquarie, Port Stephens and Maitland LGAs). This data is for the EPBC Act Listed Ecological Communities Mapping in the Lower Hunter project and has been consolidated to help map the extent of Threatened Ecological Communities (TECs) in this area. This data will aid in reviewing and analysing the likelihood of occurrence of EPBC Act listed flora and fauna within the Threatened Ecological Communities, and also support the process of identifying and providing recommendations regarding High Priority Conservation Areas within the region. Recommendations from this data regarding Key Threatening Processes have the potential to impact EPBC Act – listed ecological communities and threatened flora and fauna.\n\n* The GIS mapping data were obtained to inform sustainability planning for the Lower Hunter region, particularly to assist in informing the NSW government review of the NSW Lower Hunter regional strategy and Lower Hunter regional conservation plan.\n * Once this review is complete, the second stage is to undertake a strategic assessment of proposed urban development and related infrastructure corridors. The NSW Government has entered into an agreement with the Commonwealth to conduct a strategic assessment of proposed urban development and related infrastructure corridors.\n* The data provide the best available maps of the regional distribution of two Critically Endangered Ecological Communities protected under national environmental law – the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 (EPBC Act) – as well as the distribution of three vegetation communities nominated for listing as threatened species and ecological communities under the EPBC Act. \n * Vegetation definitions used to map the distribution of the three nominated communities are preliminary and subject to change through the listing determination process. Changes to the definition of a vegetation community may result in changes to the mapped distribution of the community.\n* While reasonable efforts have been made to ensure that the contents of this dataset are factually correct, the Commonwealth does not accept responsibility for the accuracy or completeness of the contents, and shall not be liable for any loss or damage that may be occasioned directly or indirectly through the use of, or reliance on, the contents of this dataset.CC - Attribution (CC BY)\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Australia License.

This table of historical data has been compiled as far as possible on an AAS basis, and from 2004-05 onwards, is consistent with the AASB 1049 cash flow statement presentation.

    "description": "This dataset contains spatial layers describing Forest Canopy Loss and Recovery from 1998-2019 in NSW Regional Forest Agreements (RFA) Areas along the eastern coast. \n\nThese have been based off the National Greenhouse Gas Inventory (NGGI) National Carbon Accounting System (NCAS) National Forest and Sparse Woody Vegetation Data grids (ABARES, 2020). These base grids are Landsat in origin and have a resolution of 25m.  \n\nFor this dataset product and the processing of metrics, aspects of canopy loss and disturbances in the forest estate were investigated.  Measures of canopy loss and recovery are seen as one of the multiple indicators of forest health.  This is related to agents or pressures that affect the capacity of native forests and commercial operations to maintain normal ecosystem functions and sustainably provide productive capacity. \n\nTo attribute disturbances, as a driver of change, a Multiple Lines of Evidence (MLE) approach was used that leveraged available spatial datasets.  This allowed for a project-wide disturbance and disturbance context layer to be generated. This information can be interpreted back against forest cover extent change outputs, in particular the differences between individual years, to identify the areas of change and the likely reasons why. Therefore, landscape trends in forest loss can be potentially assigned or at the very least investigated.  \n\nThe time taken, in terms of years, for areas to recover from losses in forest canopy cover extent can has also been determined. This process identifies the time taken for a patch of forest to return to a 20% canopy cover threshold, and other characteristics such as the forest type and likely disturbance or loss event. \n\nForest Canopy Loss and Recovery uses measures of canopy loss and disturbances which can be interpreted back against forest cover extent change outputs, in particular the differences between individual years, to identify the areas of change and the likely reasons why. Therefore, landscape trends in forest canopy loss can be potentially assigned or at the very least investigated. Time taken in years for areas to recover for losses has also been determined, as-well as other characteristics such as forest type and likely disturbance/loss event. \n\nBase cover extent grids used are from the NSW RFA Historic Forest Canopy Cover Extent – 1995 to 2019 product.\n\nRead more about the project on the Natural Resources Commission website:\nhttps://www.nrc.nsw.gov.au/accordion-content-main/fmip-ecosystemhealth-projectfe1\n\nThis dataset is superseded by 'NSW Forest Monitoring and Improvement Program State-Wide Historic Forest Canopy Loss and Recovery - 1998 to 2020'",

There are regional parks situated around metropolitan Perth and Bunbury that protect a range of natural areas including foreshores, ocean beaches, wetlands and the Darling Scarp. The current land tenure arrangements within the regional parks are complex with a number of different tenures and landholders existing. These may include Commonwealth or State land, local government land, private freehold land where the landowner has agreed, UCL and unmanaged reserve.\nRegional Parks provide an opportunity for coordinated land use management and planning. Parks and Wildlife works closely with local councils and community groups to manage these diverse multi purpose areas. Each Park has a community advisory committee made up of local people who advocate for the park's management on behalf of stakeholders.The Department for Planning and Infrastructure has proceeded to, and will continue to, acquire the land that is required to consolidate the parks.\n\nWas formally (DPAW-032)",

The tenacities of individual limpets in the 2 zones were collected in September and October 1987. Tenacity was measured with a hand-held device that applied a horizontal force until the limpet was detached from the substrate.",

    "description": "THE STUDY AREA\nThe Upper Parramatta River catchment covers an area of 110 square kilometres and\ncovers all land that drains to the Parramatta River upstream of its tidal limit at the\nCharles Street Weir, between the Barry Wilde Bridge (Wilde Avenue) and the Gasworks\nBridge (Macarthur Street). Most of the catchment is urbanised and has a population of\nmore than 230,000. However, there are significant areas of urban bushland, generally\nlocated along the major watercourses.\nA map of the study area is presented as Figure 1.1. The Upper Parramatta River has\na number of tributaries that flow into it within the study area. The two largest tributaries\nare Toongabbie Creek and Darling Mills Creek. Other tributaries include the following:\n\nBrickfield Creek;\nDomain Creek;\nFinlaysons Creek;\nCoopers Creek;\nPendle Creek (also known as Pendle Hill Creek);\nGreystanes Creek (also known as Girraween Creek);\nGrantham Creek;\nBlacktown Creek;\nLalor Creek;\nQuarry Creek;\nThe Quarry Branch (also known as Northmead Gully);\nExcelsior Creek;\nBlue Gum Creek;\nRifle Range Creek;\nHunts Creek.\n\nThe Upper Parramatta River catchment includes parts of the following four local\ngovernment areas (LGAs):\n\nShire of Baulkham Hills — including the suburbs of Oatlands, Carlingford, North\nRocks, Northmead, North Parramatta, West Pennant Hills, Castle Hill and\nBaulkham Hills;\nCity of Blacktown — including the suburbs of Toongabbie, Seven Hills, Prospect,\nBlacktown, Lalor Park and Kings Langley;\nCity of Holroyd — including the suburbs of Westmead, Wentworthville, South\nWentworthville, Greystanes, Pendle Hill, Girraween, Prospect, Toongabbie and\nMerrylands West;\nCity of Parramatta — including the suburbs of Parramatta, North Parramatta,\nWestmead, Northmead, Wentworthville, Toongabbie, Old Toongabbie and\nWinston Hills.\n\nOBJECTIVES OF THIS STUDY\nThe primary objective of the current Upper Parramatta River Floodplain Risk\nManagement Study and Plan is to bring together, and place in appropriate context, all\npast, current and proposed future activities related to the reduction of flood risk in the\ncatchment. In broad terms, the current study has investigated what can be done to\nminimise the effects of flooding in the Upper Parramatta River catchment and\nrecommended a strategy in the form of a Floodplain Risk Management Plan.\nAs mentioned above, despite the expenditure of more than $35 million on flood\nmitigation works and measures since 1989, none of the four councils within the area of\nthe Trust have adopted a formal Floodplain Risk Management Plan as required by the\nNew South Wales (NSW) Government’s Flood Prone Land Policy. This study and plan\nconstitute key components of the NSW Government’s floodplain risk management\nprocess as outlined in the Floodplain Management Manual (NSW Government, 2001)\n(see Section 1.4).\nSome of the objectives of the study include:\n\nbriefly outlining the hydrological and hydraulic modelling activities that have been\nundertaken for the catchment to date;\nbriefly reviewing the past, current and future flood-related activities of the Trust\nand the four constituent Councils;\nreviewing, in detail, issues relating to planning and development controls within\nthe catchment’s floodplains;\nidentifying additional floodplain risk management measures that particularly relate\nto community awareness about flooding, the release of flood-related information\nto the community, flood warning and emergency management;\ndeveloping a mutually agreeable Floodplain Risk Management Plan for the Upper\nParramatta River catchment that outlines the best measures to reduce flood\ndamage, based on environmental, social, economic, financial and engineering\nconsiderations.\n\nReport\nThe structure of this report is as follows:\nChapter 2 summarises the flood problems, together with the behaviour and\nimpacts of flooding in the Upper Parramatta River catchment. Chapter 2 also\ndiscusses the modelling of flood flows and flood levels in the catchment;\nChapter 3 provides an overview of the previous flood-related studies and\ninvestigations that have been undertaken in the catchment, together with an\noutline of the available mapping and survey that has been carried out;\nChapter 4 presents an overview of floodplain risk management measures\navailable for dealing with flood problems generally and the methodology used to\nassess these management measures in the current study. The large number of\nfloodplain risk management measures that have already examined and\nimplemented in the catchment are also listed in this chapter;\nChapter 5 discusses possible future floodplain risk management options for the\nUpper Parramatta River catchment, particularly flood-related planning and\ndevelopment controls, community awareness about flooding, the release of floodrelated\ninformation to the community, flood warning and emergency\nmanagement;\nChapter 6 lists all the documents referenced in this study;\nChapter 7 provides a bibliography of all studies and investigations that have\nbeen undertaken in the catchment since the early 1970s;\nChapter 8 provides a glossary of terms used in this study.",

The Future Reef MAP project is funded by Rio Tinto Alcan and administered by the Great Barrier Reef Foundation, with an equal co-investment by CSIRO. The project is the first large-scale CO2 observing system established on the Great Barrier Reef using the Rio Tinto ship, RTM Wakmatha. The research is targeted at providing information on the CO2 uptake and the controls on ocean acidification change in the region. It is providing foundation data needed to assess the vulnerability of the GBR reefs to ocean acidification. This dataset contains quality controlled underway measurements of the fugacity of CO2, atmospheric pressure, and sea surface temperature and salinity. The data management and distribution of these data were supported by the CSIRO Carbon Collaboration Cluster and the Australian Coastal Ecosystem Facility.",

    "description": "This dataset presents the school zones for Prep/Foundation Junior Secondary schools in Victoria for the year of 2020.\nAll public primary and secondary schools, including Prep/Foundation to Year 9 and multi-campus schools have enrolment zones. This does not include schools with specific enrolment criteria including English Language Schools and Select Entry Schools. Specialist schools also do not have zones and have special enrolment criteria.\nDesignated neighbourhood schools are generally the public school within closest proximity to the student’s permanent residential address, unless the Minister for Education or Regional Director has restricted the zone of the school. Closest proximity is calculated as the nearest school by straight line distance in metropolitan areas (including Geelong, Ballarat and Bendigo), or the nearest school by shortest practical route (in regional areas). Zones were produces in Datum 1994 VicGrid projection (EPSG: 3111) using locations that represent the front of the school or driveway access. Voronoi polygons define the measure of straight line distance and calculations using road classes 0 to 7 in the VicMap road network layer were used to define the measure of shortest practical route. \nThe zones of schools defined as metropolitan have taken preference over the zones of regional schools where they interface. A small number of zones have been restricted by the Minister for Education to support schools in managing their enrolments. Some schools zones have been aligned with structural and geographic barriers recognising the significant accessibility issues they impose. School enrolment zones are reviewed annually and updated as government school provision changes. The school zone dataset is comprised of distinct map layers for primary schools and for each year of secondary school, acknowledging the different year levels offered by schools.\nFor more information please visit the Victorian Government Data Portal or the Find My School website.\nPlease note: \n\nThe Victorian school zone layers can be used in conjunction with the Victorian school location layers.\n",

    "description": "Overview  \r\n This report examines Australian and international experience in monitoring farmgate and retail prices for food products. It also outlines a simple methodology to monitor farm shares and farm-to-retail price spreads for food products, and investigates the potential to apply the methodology to Australian data. \r\n\r\n Key Points  \r\n• The food retail sector in Australia is highly concentrated while there is increasing consolidation in the food processing sector. There is some concern that this could lead to farmers receiving lower prices and consumers paying higher prices than would be the case in a perfectly competitive market. \r\n• The paper reviews local and international research in monitoring movements in farm and retail prices for food products, outlines a simple methodology to monitor farm shares and farm-to-retail price spreads for food products, and investigates the potential to apply the methodology to Australian data. \r\n• The review of international research found significant variation across countries in the importance they place on food price monitoring and analysis. Research has consistently found that the more processed food products are, the lower the farm share, and that farm shares have generally been declining over time. \r\n• The review also found that the United States Department of Agriculture Economic Research Service (USDA ERS) is a world leader in analysing prices in food supply chains. The paper outlines a relatively simple methodology used by the USDA ERS to monitor changes in farm shares and farm-to-retail price spreads for food products. \r\n• While there are limitations with the USDA ERS approach, an increase in farm-to-retail price spread or a decrease in farm share of the retail price could be a useful early indicator that competition issues are emerging within a supply chain. However, additional analysis will always be required to confirm whether the cause was an increase in market power because these changes can occur for a number of reasons, including differences in productivity in different sectors or input prices increasing at a faster rate in the retail sector than in the farm sector. Unfortunately, there is generally a lack of data that will allow a breakdown in marketing costs to facilitate this analysis. \r\n• One option for additional research is to replicate another methodology developed by the USDA ERS, which uses input-output data to decompose costs and profits between different sectors within a supply chain and to estimate returns to primary factors, including capital and labour. This type of analysis would be more expensive than the high-level analysis described in this paper but it would also be more informative than the farm share/price spread analysis in identifying the range of factors influencing prices, and lead to a more informed debate about the various factors influencing prices, including market power. \r\n",

    "description": "This data was collected in January 2008 by the IMOS Ship of Opportunity Underway CO2 Measurement research group on RV Southern Surveyor (IMOS platform code: VLHJ) voyage SS012008.\n\nDeparted: \tHobart, Tasmania, January 11, 2008\nArrived:  \tHobart, Tasmania February 01, 2008\n\nCO2 System Overview:\nThe fugacity of carbon dioxide (fCO2) in surface seawater was measured using a General Oceanics Inc. automated system (Model 8050; Pierrot et al 2009). Seawater is sprayed into an equilibration chamber and CO2 in the headspace gas equilibrates with the seawater. The headspace gas is pumped through a thermoelectric condenser followed by a nafion drying tube before flowing through a Licor 7000 non-dispersive infrared gas analyser used to measure the CO2 mole fraction (XCO2) of the dried air. The gas flow is stopped temporarily for the CO2 measurements, which are made at atmospheric pressure. A set of four CO2 standards that cover the range of CO2 values expected in the ocean are analysed about every four hours to calibrate the gas analyser. The standard gas concentrations are on the WMO-X2007 mole fraction scale for CO2-in-air. Atmospheric XCO2 (dry) is measured after the standards by pumping clean outside air from an intake on the forward mast of the ship. \n\nSeawater intake and ancillary data:\nThe seawater intake is located at about 5.5m depth in the bow of the ship. Sea surface salinity is measured using a thermosalinograph (Seabird Electronics SBE21) located next to the CO2 system. A remote temperature sensor (Seabird Electronics SBE 38) located at the intake is used to measure sea surface temperature (SST). The travel time between the intake and CO2 system is typically about 4 minutes with warming usually less than 0.6ºC. The thermosalinograph water is from the same intake, but the supply lines separate after the intake. A comparison of thermosalinograph and equilibrator temperature records shows the temperature difference in the two lines is generally less than 0.1ºC. The thermosalinograph water line travels outside the ship and is typically warmer than the equilibrator. The travel time in water line to the thermosalinograph is 2.5 minutes faster than to the equilibrator. \n\nMeteorological data, salinity, SST, and ships position and time are taken from the ships logging system. These parameters and the data quality are maintained by the Australian Marine National Facility.",

    "description": "As part of MTSRF Project 4.8.1, this study aimed to assess the benefit of no-take (green) zones as a recruitment source. 1342 adult stripey snapper (Lutjanus carponotatus) from 3 green zones around the Keppel Islands were fin-clipped for genetic analysis and released. Microsatellite markers were used to assign juveniles to one or both parents. From the 483 juveniles collected from 16 sites in both green and blue zones, 140 (~30%) were assigned to one or both parents from the adult sample. Of the 140 juveniles, 16% had recruited into home green zones, 62% had dispersed into blue zones, and the remainder had dispersed among other green zones.\n\n\nReferences:\n\nAlmany GR, Hamilton RJ,  Williamson DH, Evans RD, Jones GP, Matawai M, Potuku T, Rhodes KL, Russ GR and Sawynok B.

    "description": "The Macquarie Rivulet catchment drains an area of 110 square kilometres extending from the shores of Lake Illawarra upstream for a distance of approximately 23 km to the Illawarra escarpment. The upper parts of the catchment (up to 770 mAHD) are characterised by steep gradients moving to flatter terrain in the lower reaches of Macquarie Rivulet dropping to approximately mean sea level. The catchment is made up of a number of tributaries including the main Macquarie Rivulet, as well as Frazers Creek, Marshall Mount Creek and Yellow Rock Creek. There have been several recorded instances of flood-producing storms in the catchment, including February 1984, June 1991, February 1992 and most recently March 2011. The largest recent historical floods within the catchment are believed to have occurred in 1959, 1961 and 1975, however there is limited information regarding these earlier floods.\n\nThe key objective of the Macquarie Rivulet Flood Study is the development of computational hydrologic and hydraulic models that define design flood behaviour for the 20%, 10%, 5%, 2%, 1%, 0.5% and the Probable Maximum Flood (PMF) design storms in the study area. The key sequential reporting stages include:\n<ul>\n<li>Stage 1: Data Collection plus Assessment and Community Consultation;</li>\n<li>Stage 2: Model Calibration and Validation;</li>\n<li>Stage 3: Modelling and Mapping of Design Flood Events.</li>\n</ul>",

    "description": "This dataset provides Australian Bureau of Statistics mesh block boundaries with integrated census demographics for Kalgoorlie-Boulder, enabling aggregation of building-level solar potential to standard statistical geography units for policy analysis and planning.\n\nThe dataset contains 530 mesh blocks - the finest-resolution census geography - enriched with 2021 Census dwelling and population counts, complete hierarchical statistical area codes (SA1-SA4), and topographic classifications. Mesh blocks serve as the fundamental spatial unit linking building-level solar estimates to Australian statistical datasets, enabling integration with census, health, transport, and other ABS data collections.\n\nKey applications include analysing solar potential per capita across neighbourhoods, identifying areas with high rooftop capacity relative to population density, evaluating equity in renewable energy access across socio-economic areas, and aggregating building-level results to SA2 or SA3 regions for regional planning. This geography enables comparative analysis with other Australian cities using standardised ABS boundaries.\n\nTarget users include policy analysts requiring census-compatible spatial units, researchers linking solar potential to demographic or socio-economic variables, and government planners developing place-based renewable energy strategies. The hierarchical statistical area codes enable flexible aggregation from mesh blocks (finest scale) through SA1-SA4 to the state level.\n\nMesh block boundaries reflect 2021 Census geography and differ from 2016 Census in some locations. Use the \"changed since 2016\" flag to identify modified boundaries. Population counts represent usual residence on Census night, not daytime presence relevant to commercial solar usage.\n\nComprehensive technical documentation, including data dictionary, usage examples, and processing methodology, is available in <a href=\"https://resources.aurin.org.au/ckan/resources/DataSet-Information.pdf\">here</a>; software stack details and calculation workflows are documented in <a href=\"https://resources.aurin.org.au/ckan/resources/Software_Stack.pdf\">here</a>.",

The WAMSI science plan for physical and biological oceanography in the Kimberley is focused on the southern designated MPA area (Camden Sound) to support physical and biogeochemical process model development. This metadata record describes observational data collected in support of the observational requirements for WAMSI KMRP Projects: \n2.2.1 - Physical oceanographic dynamics in the Kimberley \n2.2.2 -Pathways to Production : Biogeochemical Processes in the Kimberley Region \n2.2.6 - Terrestrial-Ocean Linkages: the role of rivers and estuaries in sustaining marine\n productivity in the Kimberley. \nPrimary data sources are: \nMoored ADCPs\nMoored Temperature salinity loggers \nUnderway Thermosalinograph \nCTD casts \nThe purpose of the data are to assist in quantifying key physical and biological oceanographic processes in nearshore waters of the coastal Kimberley under wet and dry season conditions to:\n1. better define seasonal ranges in properties and rates in Collier Bay as a basis for identifying potential climate-related changes,\n2. better define marine productivity and seasonal forcing processes \n3. acquire oceanographic and biogeochemical information necessary to develop system models. \nDetailed descriptions of science plans for each of the above listed projects is available from the project specific WAMSI II Science Project Plans.",
