The main attributes in this layer are survey id, survey location, date, time, locational accuracy, taxa recorded, counts, observation type, survey type, collector, and reliability of the record. The VERS_DATE column identifies the currency of the data.\n\nAlthough this is a point layer, the actual accuracy of the site can range from +/- 1m to +/- 500m.\n\nThe FFG field has been updated to reflect the 2021 FFG Act amendments, and the Victorian Advisory List (VICADV) is now obsolete.\n\nThis layer excludes restricted taxa records.

The data is based on modified 2016 Statistical Areas Level 2 (SA2) boundaries.\nThe AEDC is a population-based measure of children's development as they enter their first year of full-time school, and takes place nationally every three years. It looks at five domains of early childhood development: physical health and wellbeing (plus three health sub-domains), social competence, emotional maturity, language and cognitive skills, and communication skills and general knowledge.\nFor more information visit the AEDC website.\nPlease note suppression of AEDC data occurs when one or more of the following have been met:\n\n\nThree or fewer children had been assessed\n\n\nFewer than fifteen children had valid AEDC scores\n\n\nLess than two teachers had completed AEDC instruments for children in that location\n\n\nAEDC instruments were completed for less than 80% of all non special needs children\nAdditional minor suppression's have occurred where necessary to preserve confidentiality of related suppressed cells.\n\n\nPlease Note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data.\n\n\nSome AEDC results were captured across two SA2 regions, AURIN has created a custom geometry combining the relevant SA2 boundaries for these results.\n\n",

The figure below shows some of the high-level economic variables that affect our tax forecasts.\n\nThe State’s taxation revenue is forecast by a process that involves:\n\napplication of DTF’s economic forecasts, where there is a relationship between taxation revenue and economic variables; and\nuse of forward indicators, unpublished revenue data and qualitative information from liaison with relevant stakeholders.\n\nThis enables an assessment of economic and other factors influencing the tax bases from which taxes are sourced e.g. for payroll tax, an assessment of the outlook for employment.\nWhere necessary, adjustment factors are used to account for other trends or events not captured by the forecasting models, such as impact of economic shocks or policy stimulus.\nThe spreadsheets below contain the nine taxation data series:\n\ntotal taxation revenue;\npayroll tax;\nland tax;\nland transfer duty;\ngambling taxes;\ninsurance taxes;\nfire services property levy;\nmotor vehicle taxes; and\nother taxes. \n",

    "description": "<b>Oct 2024 Minor Amendment No.3</b>\n\n(Zone Map Dataset 1 of 5, needs to be used in conjunction with Local plan boundary, Local plan precincts, Zone precincts and North Lakes Locality datasets).\n\nThe Zoning Map is part of the Moreton Bay Regional Council Planning Scheme. MBRC Planning Scheme will help to respond to growth and development across the Moreton Bay Region. It is a statutory document regulating how land can be used and developed. The MBRC planning scheme replaces the three previous planning schemes created by the former Caboolture, Pine Rivers and Redcliffe councils.\n\n\n\n\n\nPlanning schemes use zones and overlays to show the location and extent of special features that need to be considered, such as where land may be subject to hazards or other characteristics. Overlay maps may apply to all or part of your property and your property may be affected by more than one overlay. Having an overlay on your property will only affect you if you intend to develop (i.e. extent or build, change use, subdivide, clear native vegetation, fill or excavate). \nThe attribute fields are defined as per Qld Planning Provisions, Schedule 2. The Queensland Planning Provisions (QPP) are the standard planning scheme provisions made by the Minister for Planning under Chapter 2, Part 5, Division 2 and Chapter 2, Part 6 of the Sustainable Planning Act 2009.",

    "description": "This dataset presents information and locations related to The Super Tuesday Bike Count event in Palmerston for 2016. The counts are presented as individual points which relate to the location where the counts were undertaken by volunteers.\nThe Super Tuesday Bike Count collects annual figures of bicycle riders and their movements on roads and bike paths. Since 2007, Bicycle Network has conducted bicycle counts at key intersections and corridors selected by local governments. The data is available for researchers and policymakers to plan and build cycling infrastructure to promote increased cycling activity, and to gather longitudinal insights of cycling volumes and trends.\nSuper Tuesday count data is collected visually by volunteer counters at intersections along popular commuter routes, as well as subsidiary routes with lower rider volumes. The count is conducted in southern states (VIC, NSW, SA, WA) between 7:00-9:00am on the first Tuesday of March; and in northern states (QLD, NT) between 6:30-8:30am on the first Tuesday of September. Count locations are nominated by traffic engineers, transport planners, and other transport officers from participating councils. Counters record all movement directions, rider gender, and bicycle volume per fifteen-minute increments on standardised count sheets. \nFor more information please visit the Norther Territory Government Open Data Portal or view the Bicycle Network Super Tuesday Count Report.\nPlease note: \n\nWhere there was no data available (\"no data\", \"NA\", \"#N/A\" in the original data) the values have been set to NULL.\n",

    "description": "This dataset presents the footprint of the percentage of adults who saw a GP after hours in the preceding 12 months. The data spans the years of 2013-2017 and is aggregated to 2015 Department of Health Primary Health Network (PHN) areas, based on the 2011 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nThe data is sourced from the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) 2016-17 Patient Experience Survey, collected between 1 July 2016 and 30 June 2017. It also includes data from previous Patient Experience Surveys conducted in 2013-14, 2014-15 and 2015-16. The Patient Experience Survey is conducted annually by the ABS and collects information from a representative sample of the Australian population. The Patient Experience Survey is one of several components of the Multipurpose Household Survey, as a supplement to the monthly Labour Force Survey. The Patient Experience Survey collects data on persons aged 15 years and over, who are referred to as adults for this data collection.\nFor further information about this dataset, visit the data source:Australian Institute of Health and Welfare - Patient experiences in Australia Data Tables.\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data using the Department of Health - PHN Areas.\n\n\nPercentages are calculated based on counts that have been randomly adjusted by the ABS to avoid the release of confidential data.\n\n\nAs an indication of the accuracy of estimates, 95% confidence intervals were produced. These were calculated by the ABS using standard error estimates of the proportion.\n\n\nSome of the patient experience measures for 2016-17 have age-standardised rates presented. Age-standardised rates are hypothetical rates that would have been observed if the populations studied had the same age distribution as the standard population.\n\n\nCrude rates are provided for all years. They should be used for understanding the patterns of actual service use or level of experience in a particular PHN.\n\n\nThe Patient Experience Survey excludes persons aged less than 15 years, persons living in non-private dwellings and the Indigenous Community Strata (encompassing discrete Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities).\n\n\nData for Northern Territory should be interpreted with caution as the Patient Experience Survey excluded the Indigenous Community Strata, which comprises around 25% of the estimated resident population of the Northern Territory living in private dwellings.\n\n\nRows that contain a \"#\" in \"Interpret with Caution\" indicates that the estimate has a relative standard error of 25% to 50%, which indicates a high level of sampling error relative to its value and must be taken into account when comparing this estimate with other values.\n\n\nNP - Not available for publication. The estimate is considered to be unreliable. Values assigned to NP in the original data have been set to null.\n\n",

    "description": "One of the objectives of the Fisheries Management Act 1994 is to 'conserve key fish habitats'.\nTo achieve the objectives of the Fisheries Management Act, 1994 DPI-Fisheries has identified 'Key Fish Habitats' – those aquatic habitats that are important to the sustainability of the recreational and commercial fishing industries, the maintenance of fish populations generally, and the survival and recovery of threatened aquatic species.\nA policy definition of the term 'Key Fish Habitat' (KFH) was developed to guide the compilation of maps. KFH was defined to include all marine and estuarine habitats up to highest astronomical tide level (that reached by 'king' tides) and most permanent and semipermanent freshwater habitats including rivers, creeks, lakes, lagoons, billabongs, weir pools and impoundments up to the top of the bank.\nSmall headwater creeks and gullies (known as first and second order streams), that only flow for a short period after rain are generally excluded, as are farm dams constructed on such systems. Wholly artificial waterbodies such as irrigation channels, urban drains and ponds, salt and evaporation ponds are also excluded except where they are known to support populations of threatened fish or invertebrates.\nFeedback or questions relating to Key Fish Habitat Mapping data can be sent to:  fisheries.data@dpi.nsw.gov.au",

Fire trails and tracks are given relevant attributes for operational use, management purposes, and public distribution such as permitted recreational use, recreational difficulty, regulatory permissions, as well as a public status to define tracks or fire trails that may not be suitable for public use.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Rec_Use attributes is used to designate one of four types of recreational track/trail:\n<ol><li>Bike Track (bikes only)</li><li>Fire Trail (walkers and bikes permitted)</li><li>Shared Use (walkers and bikes permitted)</li><li>Walking Track (walkers only)</li></ol>\n\n\n\nThe values for the Bike_Grade and Walk_Grade attributes represent the difficulty rating for each activity (actually 1-5). They are mostly the same between each activity, but do differ in some instances. The following classifications apply.\n<ol><li>Very Easy</li><li>Easy</li><li>Moderate</li><li>Difficult</li><li>Very Difficult</li></ol>\n\nThe following values apply to the status field\n<ol><li>Open</li><li>Closed</li><li>Unmaintained</li><li>Closed for works (temporary closure)</li></ol>\n\nAll fire trails that do not have status 'Unmaintained' are accessible by 4WD\n\nData accessible in the open data portal is filtered for only those tracks that are City of Hobart owned or maintained.\n\n\n\n\n\nWHILE ALL REASONABLE CARE HAS BEEN TAKEN TO ENSURE THE ACCURACY OF THE INFORMATION PORTRAYED IN THIS DATA, ITS PURPOSE IS TO PROVIDE A GENERAL INDICATION OF THE LOCATION OF COUNCIL SERVICES.

    "description": "Data describes habitat suitability modelling (HSM) results for platypus. The data was developed by the University of Melbourne through the Melbourne Waterways Research Practice Partnership as part of the development of Melbourne Water’s Healthy Waterways Strategy 2018 (HWS2018). Analysis has been undertaken across the Melbourne Water operating region, where the operating region has been divided into 16,346 sub-catchments. Of these 16,346 subcatchments, 8233 contain Melbourne Water waterways. The results are presented for each of these 8233 reaches. The data was used to estimate scores for platypus presented in the HWS for three scenarios:\n\n<ul><li>Current: habitat suitability for platypus under current conditions (i.e. 2014).</li><li>Current trajectory: habitat suitability for platypus under urbanisation and climate change scenarios if current management approaches continue.</li><li>Target trajectory: habitat suitability for platypus given urbanisation and climate change (as for current trajectory), together with (a) delivery of performance objectives of the Healthy Waterways Strategy and (b) achievement of environmental condition scores as described in the Catchment Programs of the Healthy Waterways Strategy. Presentation of habitat suitabilty model results for platypus from the Healthy Waterways Strategy 2018. </li></ul>\n\n\n\nHabitat Suitability Model results have been thoroughly reviewed and are considered fit for purpose (i.e. for waterway planning). This data set covers the entire Melbourne Water region with the exception of very small areas close to Port Phillip Bay or Western Port. For example, there are small areas of French Island which are not captured.\n\n\n\nThis data set was created using: 1. Streams dataset for the Healthy Waterways Strategy 2018. This layer was developed by GraceGIS using Melbourne Water layers as inputs. 2. Results from Habitat Suitability Modelling for the Healthy Waterways Strategy 2018. \n\n\n\nFurther reading: Chee et al. (in development), Habitat Suitability Models, Scenarios and Quantitative Action Prioritisation (using Zonation) for Melbourne Water’s Healthy Waterways Strategy: A Resource Document, University of Melbourne and Melbourne Water for Melbourne Waterways Research Practice Partnership Melbourne Water (in development), Healthy Waterways Strategy Resource Document\n\n\n\nNOTE: Whilst every effort has been taken in collecting, validating and providing the attached data, Melbourne Water Corporation makes no representations or guarantees as to the accuracy or completeness of this data.

    "description": "AusCPR: Phytoplankton Abundance.  The Australian Continuous Plankton Recorder (AusCPR) survey is a joint project between CSIRO Oceans and Atmosphere (O&amp;A) and the Australian Antarctic Division (AAD) to measure plankton communities as a guide to the health of Australia's oceans. The phytoplankton abundance data are analysed as per Richardson et al 2006. Phytoplankton are usually counted from water samples after settling but in the CPR analysis we count the phytoplankton in situ. With CPR samples, the phytoplankton is captured by the mesh and are caught by the silk strands, by phytoplankton mucilage, and/or by other organisms on the silk. It is thus possible to see the phytoplankton cells directly on the mesh. In essence, the phytoplankton is already concentrated. Washing the phytoplankton off the silks to count in the standard manner may result in loss of or damage to cells before analysis.\nIt is advised that anyone using the data should first read this methodology or contact the project contact person. The aims of the AusCPR survey are to: * map plankton biodiversity and distribution * develop the first long-term plankton baseline for Australian waters * document plankton changes in response to climate change * provide indices for fisheries management * detect harmful algal blooms * validate satellite remote sensing * initialise and test ecosystem models.  Servicing and maintenance of the CPRs and analysis of the samples for the AusCPR survey will be carried out by staff based at the O&amp;A laboratories in Queensland and at the AAD in Hobart. The project was funded by the Integrated Marine Observing System (IMOS) and falls with the Ships of Opportunity facility. Data storage and access is planned to be interoperable with other national and international programs through the IMOS Infrastructure. Results from the AusCPR survey are available through the AODN portal: https://portal.aodn.org.au.  For information on using the data please refer to the Richardson et al. 2006. As the taxonomic resolution of the data has changed over time, due to continual training, it is important that users refer to the change log tables included in your data download. These will provide information on the validity of the taxa, from what date we have been identifying certain taxa etc. Classification fields may be blank depending on the level to which that taxa has been identified, i.e. if only identified to family, genus and species will be blank. This data is freely available but please acknowledge all relevant parties, as detailed in acknowledgement section.",

It shows the current and retired states of each feature instance.  It  supports feature versioning (UFI_RETIRED) and enables feature edting chaining (UFI_OLD).\n\nThe dataset is continually maintained, obtaining maintenance from authoritative sources within State Government.\n\nVLAT_GOV_ROAD_POLYGON is a polygon layer depicting Government Roads including roads as laid out on Parish Plans &amp; proclaimed as Road in Government Gazettes.\n\nThe Vicmap Parcel and VM_CROWN_SIMPLE layer is also recording \"G\" CROWN_STATUS Parcels that are Government Roads parcelled by the Crown Land Registry unit.",

    "description": "Volumetric estimates of organic carbon being created by photosynthesis or consumed by ecosystem respiration.  Flow-MER deploys data loggers to record changes in dissolved oxygen, light and temperature over the course of 24 hours with continuous recording every 5 minutes. The data is analysed using the statistical model ‘BASEv2’ (BAyesian Single-station Estimation). The model (Grace et al. 2015) was updated during 2016 in accordance with methodological recommendations contained within Song et al. (2016).  Flow-MER converts these BASE volumetric estimates (this data set) into reach-scale estimates with the appropriate hydraulic information (cross-sectional area) to estimate the amount of organic carbon being created by photosynthesis or consumed by ecosystem respiration in a nominal 1 kilometre (km) stream reach at the gauging site.\r\n\r\nThe CEWH’s Flow-MER program examines the contribution of Commonwealth environmental water to the environmental objectives of the Basin Plan 2012 (Basin Plan) and is assisting the CEWH to demonstrate environmental outcomes and adaptively manage the water holdings. Monitoring and evaluation is focused in seven Selected Areas: the Junction of the Warrego and Darling rivers, Gwydir river system, Lachlan river system, Murrumbidgee river system, Edward/Kolety-Wakool river system, Goulburn River and Lower Murray River. \r\n\r\nThis Flow-MER data set includes and extends the long-term data collected at the same sites during the Long Term Intervention Monitoring (LTIM) project (2014-2019).\r\n\r\nGrace MR, Giling DP, Hladyz S, Caron V, Thompson RM, Mac Nally R (2015) Fast processing of diel oxygen curves: estimating stream metabolism with BASE (BAyesian Single-station Estimation).

The purpose of a CMP is to assist a school to return to, or maintain, a sustainable enrolment level and to assist children to be able to attend their local school.\nThe CMP outlines the enrolment criteria relevant to each school. The Department for Education has been implementing CMPs since 2009. Generally, the CMPs, over a period of time, have supported schools to manage enrolment demand within their school enrolment capacity. Further strategies include the provision of additional accommodation, implementation of a school zone or planning for new educational facilities.\nCMPs are approved by the Minister and published in the South Australian Government Gazette.\nRefer to the Capacity Management Plan webpage \nfor more information and links to the CMPs published in the South Australian Government Gazette.",

    "description": "This dataset estimates human mobility through origin destination (OD) movement flow among the Statistical Area 2 (SA2) regions in New South Wales (NSW), connected by public transport (PT) networks. The SA2 regions of New South Wales connected by Sydney trains (T1-T9) and Metro services (Metro North West line) have been used to evaluate OD movement flows. The passenger OD movement data among different stations (or the station-based OD flow) are first estimated using a statistical estimation methodology. The stations-based OD flow data are then translated into region-based OD matrices using the state-of-art method. For more information please see the original metadata file here.\nHuman mobility data is a key ingredient in various areas and domains of research including epidemiology, policy and administration, criminology, transportation, logistics and supply chains, environmental management and, pollution and contamination. High quality human mobility data provided by telecommunication companies collected from call data records (CDRs) is available at prohibitive cost with restrictive licensing, keeping it out of reach for the majority of research community. On the other hand, there is an abundance of high-quality public data, reporting different aspects of mobility. Examples are the public transport patronage and information about the usage of the Australian road network. These datasets are collected by different organisations and government departments and are presented in various formats. For instance, data may be collected at different spatial (e.g. at state or postcode levels) and temporal scales and be presented in the form of passenger counts or aggregated movement flows. This dataset addresses the general lack of national scale comprehensive human mobility dataset in Australia by transforming available mobility data into a consistent format that is suitable for analysis in a broad range of research areas. Merging the various individual datasets into Australia's first comprehensive, national-scale human mobility data asset drastically improves the quality and coverage of existing datasets.\nThe Mobility Australia project received investment (https://doi.org/10.47486/DP702) from the Australian Research Data Commons (ARDC). The ARDC is funded by the National Collaborative Research Infrastructure Strategy (NCRIS).\nThe original data tables were structured in a matrix-like format. AURIN employed a methodology to merge diverse datasets into a comprehensive one, categorising based on transportation types (e.g., trains, buses, rails, ferries), years (e.g., 2019, 2020, 2021, etc.), and temporal scales (e.g., weekly, monthly, yearly). Subsequently, AURIN spatially enabled the original data by employing the 2021 edition of the Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS). The flow between origin and destination pairs is visually represented using line geometry.",

    "description": "    \n\nCalculated annual (00) and monthly (01a|12) potential evaporation (mm) for the\nperiod 1980-1999. Calculated by the Priestley-Taylor method. Interpretation:\nPotential evaporation is an expression of the amount of water that it should\nbe possible to evaporate from an open water surface given the prevailing solar\nradiation, air temperature, and air dryness conditions. Potential evaporation\nis generally high over the Australian continent, significantly exceeding\nrainfall in all but the wettest areas. It is extreme (approaching 10mm/day) in\nthe northern inland in summer. It decreases with decreasing solar radiation,\nthat is with increasing southern latitude and in winter. Potential evaporation\nalso decreases with proximity to coasts, because of increasing cloudiness.\nActual evaporation is controlled by the various resistances to moisture loss\noffered by plants and soil. Notes: These are model-based estimates from the\nBiosEquil model. Results are given for the aBasea (pre-1788) and aAgrica\n(present day) conditions. The aAgrica case includes current agricultural\ninputs of water from irrigation.EvapPT.00, EvapPT.01 a| EvapPT.12 a Mean\nannual and monthly potential evaporation (mm)Data is in albers equal area, and\nunprojected using GDA94.\n\nSee [further metadata](http://data.daff.gov.au/anrdl/metadata_files/pa_ampe_r9cl\n__01512a00.xml) for more detail.\n\n",

    "description": "As part of Phase Two of the National Landcare Program (NLP) the Australian Government’s natural resource management (NRM) investments will be delivered within NLP Management Units. The NLP Management Units dataset is maintained for the purpose of authoritative reporting on the Australian Government's NRM investments. It is designed to cover all Australian territory where Australian Government funded NRM investments might be delivered. This dataset should not be used to represent legal boundaries (notwithstanding that some boundaries are defined by legislation in some states and territories). It is an administrative dataset developed for the purpose of reporting and public information. Alterations to either the attribution or boundaries of the data may occur in the future, for example to accord with changes to NRM delivery arrangements or to reflect revisions of state/territory regional boundaries.Current VersionThe 2018 version NLP Management Units dataset contains 58 separate mapping objects. These comprise:56 mainland Management Units. A separate object for Lord Howe Island (part of North Coast, NSW Management Unit) A “Marine NRM” Management Unit which combines Australia's Territorial Sea (from 3 nautical miles to 12 nautical miles) and Australia’s Exclusive Economic Zone (to 200 nautical miles). It excludes coastal waters (to 3 nautical miles) which are part of the terrestrial NLP Management Units. It also excludes Ashmore & Cartier Islands, Australian Antarctic Territory, Christmas Island, Cocos & Keeling Islands, Macquarie Island, Herd & MacDonald Islands and Norfolk Island, and those parts of Australia's Territorial Sea and Exclusive Economic Zone that surround these locations.The 2018 version was derived from the former NRM regions series (latest version was 2017), originally established in 2006 as the “Natural Heritage Trust II (NHT2) Region Boundaries” dataset. No changes to the spatial alignment of terrestrial region boundaries was made in transitioning from NRM regions to NRM Management Units. The principle data fields in the 2018 version dataset are:NLP_MU (note this replaces the former NRM_Region field) State (state, territory or ‘external’for the Marine NRM unit)Area_Description (eg land area only, state and coastal waters, )NRM_ID (as described below)NRM_ID and NLP_MU names, grouped by state/territory, are as follows:New South Wales (11 Management Units + 1 extra map object for Lord Howe Island)1010 Central Tablelands1020 Central West1030 Greater Sydney1040 Hunter1050 Murray1060 North Coast (excludes Lord Howe Island)1061 North Coast - Lord Howe Island1070 North West NSW1080 Northern Tablelands1090 Riverina1100 South East NSW1110 WesternVictoria (10 Management Units)2010 Corangamite2020 East Gippsland2030 Glenelg Hopkins2040 Goulburn Broken2050 Mallee2060 North Central2070 North East2080 Port Phillip and Western Port2090 West Gippsland 2100 WimmeraQueensland (15 Management Units) 3010 Burnett Mary3020 Cape York3030 Condamine3040 Co-operative Management Area (between Cape York and Northern Gulf)3050 Desert Channels3060 Fitzroy3070 Burdekin 3080 Northern Gulf3090 Maranoa Balonne and Border Rivers 3100 Mackay Whitsunday3110 South East Queensland3120 South West Queensland3130 Southern Gulf3140 Wet Tropics3150 Torres StraitSouth Australia (8 Management Units) 4010 Adelaide and Mount Lofty Ranges4020 Alinytjara Wilurara4030 Eyre Peninsula4040 Kangaroo Island4050 Northern and Yorke4060 South Australian Arid Lands4070 South Australian Murray Darling Basin4080 South EastWestern Australia (7 Management Units)5010 Northern Agricultural Region5020 Peel-Harvey Region5030 Swan Region 5040 Rangelands Region5050 South Coast Region5060 South West Region5070 Avon River BasinTasmania (3 Management Units)6010 North West NRM Region6020 North NRM Region6030 South NRM RegionNorthern Territory (1 Management Unit)7010 Northern TerritoryAustralian Capital Territory (1 Management Unit)8010 ACTExternal (1 Management Unit) 9060 Marine NRMPrevious VersionsThe 2017 version updated the previous version (2016 version 2) with changes to region boundaries in Western Australia and NRM names in Qld, Tas and WA. The 2017 version also removed the NRM_BODY data (added for 2016 version 2) and the non-spatial OceanWatch map label previously included. The 2016 version 2 updated the marine portion of the NRM regions to be consistent with the current (2015) Australian Maritime Boundaries Information System (AMBIS) coastal water limit boundary. It also included a new four digit unique NRM_ID field for sorting purposes. The 2016 version 2 maintained definitions established in the 2015 version, including for the Peel-Harvey NRM region and for the OceanWatch Australia Limited NRM organisation (not spatially defined). It also maintained changes made in earlier versions including: the 2014 changes in NSW from Catchment Management Authorities (CMA) to Local Land Service areas; and the 2012 update/formalisation of the 2010 dataset (which was an interim update of the NRM Regions 2009 dataset, released Feb 2009). The original base layer version of this dataset was released in 2006 as the Natural Heritage Trust II (NHT2) Region Boundaries dataset.Data to be available in the Public Domain under Creative Commons by Attribution Licensing Agreement. \nMore information can be found here: http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/au/deed.en\nCC - Attribution (CC BY)\n© Commonwealth of Australia (Department of the Environment and Energy) 2018",

The site provides additional features for viewing and interacting with the data and for downloading the data in various formats.</em></strong>  \n\nBrisbane City Council has partnered with a number of community gardens around Brisbane to help residents turn food scraps into nutrients for soil.Food waste is a big part of avoidable waste that goes into Brisbane’s general household bins. Composting helps to reduce the amount of food waste we send to landfill, while also reducing the harmful greenhouse gases that are released. It’s also an easy way to experience where our food comes from and shows how valuable our food scraps can be in the cultivation and harvesting cycle.Brisbane’s Community composting hub program encourages residents living near a hub to regularly contribute their food scraps. With support from Council and community volunteer caretakers, residents can learn about the benefits of composting and other ways to reduce the amount of food waste they create.More information on compost and food waste recycling can be found on the <a href=\"https://www.brisbane.qld.gov.au/clean-and-green/green-home-and-community/sustainable-gardening/compost-and-food-waste-recycling\">Brisbane City Council website</a>.",

Derwent Bay Watch is a collaborative program between councils and state government that tests water quality at 19 bays, coves and other sites around the estuary during summer months. Water samples are collected each Tuesday from the start of December to the end of March and analysed for the faecal indicator bacteria Enterococci (Enteralert method) at the Public health Lab. Because the samples must be cultured, it takes several days to publish the results.",

    "description": "AusCPR: Zooplankton Abundance.  The Australian Continuous Plankton Recorder (AusCPR) survey is a joint project between CSIRO Oceans and Atmosphere (O&amp;A) and the Australian Antarctic Division (AAD) to measure plankton communities as a guide to the health of Australia's oceans. The zooplankton analysis is conducted differently to that described in Richardson et al 2006 as it is counted off the silk in a bogorov tray. This is accomplished by rinsing the silks in water and straining through a 10 micron mesh sieve. The collected plankton is transferred to a bogorov tray and counted under a dissecting scope. This is done to retain the phytoplankton. After counting the zooplankton and phytoplankton are stored with the silk segment in PGP preservative. AusCPR decided to analyse the zooplankton this way as it provides a more accurate analysis of the zooplankton present. It is easy to miss zooplankton when it is still on the silk and it is harder to identify. The aims of the AusCPR survey are to: * map plankton biodiversity and distribution * develop the first long-term plankton baseline for Australian waters * document plankton changes in response to climate change * provide indices for fisheries management * detect harmful algal blooms * validate satellite remote sensing * initialise and test ecosystem models.  Servicing and maintenance of the CPRs and analysis of the samples for the AusCPR survey will be carried out by staff based at the O&amp;A CSIRO laboratories in Queensland and Hobart and at the AAD in Hobart. The project was funded by the Integrated Marine Observing System (IMOS) and falls with the Ships of Opportunity facility. Data storage and access is planned to be interoperable with other national and international programs through the IMOS Infrastructure. Results from the AusCPR survey are available through the AODN portal:- https://portal.aodn.org.au. For information on using the data please refer to the Richardson et al. 2006. As the taxonomic resolution of the data has changed over time, due to continual training, it is important that users refer to the change log tables included in your data download. These will provide information on the validity of the taxa, from what date we have been identifying certain taxa etc. Classification fields may be blank depending on the level to which that taxa has been identified, i.e. if only identified to family, genus and species will be blank. This data is freely available but please acknowledgment all relevant parties, as detailed in acknowledgement section.",

    "description": "**This is a superseded dataset, the current *Forest's of Australia (2023)* dataset can be found at: https://www.agriculture.gov.au/abares/forestsaustralia/forest-data-maps-and-tools/spatial-data.**\r\n\r\nForests of Australia (2013) v2.0 is a continental dataset of forest extent by national forest categories and types. It was developed from multiple forest, vegetation and land cover data inputs, including contributions from relevant Australian, state and territory government agencies and external sources. \r\n\r\n A forest is defined in this dataset as \"An area, incorporating all living and non-living components, that is dominated by trees having usually a single stem and a mature or potentially mature stand height exceeding two metres and with existing or potential crown cover of overstorey strata about equal to or greater than 20 per cent. This includes Australia's diverse native forests and plantations, regardless of age. It is also sufficiently broad to encompass areas of trees that are sometimes described as woodlands\". \r\n\r\n The dataset was compiled by the National Forest Inventory (NFI) - a collaborative partnership between the Australian and state and territory governments - whose role is to collate, integrate and communicate information on Australia's forests. States and Territories agencies collect forest data using independent methods and at varying scales or resolutions. The NFI, through the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics and Sciences (ABARES), applies a national classification to state and territory data to allow seamless integration. Independent and multiple sources of external data are used to fill data gaps and improve the quality of the final dataset. \r\n\r\n Forests of Australia (2013) v2.0 presents the new NFI classification with three national forest categories, as reported by the NFI in  Australia's State of the Forests Report 2013  (SOFR 2013), and replaces the spatial dataset titled Forests of Australia (2013). The three national forest categories are: Native forest, Industrial plantations and Other forests. The 'Native forest' category has previously been reported by the NFI, however, 'Industrial plantations' and 'Other forests' are new categories for planted forests: 'Industrial plantations', for plantations managed commercially and reported through the National Plantation Inventory (NPI), and 'Other forest' for planted forest not managed commercially or otherwise not reported through the NPI. \r\n\r\n Forests of Australia dataset series are produced to fulfil requirements of the Australia's  National Forest Policy Statement (NFPS)  and the  Regional Forests Agreement (RFA) Act 2002.  The dataset is used for domestic and international reporting. ",

    "description": "This dataset contains survey data for bird species across various river and wetland locations in the City of Melbourne. Bird transect surveys were conducted by Ecology Australia at the following locations: Dynon Road, West Melbourne, Wildlife Sanctuary (1), Dynon Road, West Melbourne, Tidal Drain (2), Moonee Ponds Creek lower catchment near Racecourse Road, Kensington and Dynon Road, West Melbourne (3), Maribyrnong River near Newells Paddock and Dynon Road, West Melbourne (4), Royal Park Oak Street Wetland (5), and Stony Creek Backwash, Footscray (6). Surveys were undertaken during daylight hours and were repeated on various dates throughout February and March 2018. Bird surveys were conducted by completing transects along the waterbodies and identifying bird species and numbers. These surveys were undertaken to primarily track bird species richness at Site (1) with Site (3) existing as a reference site with comparable habitat characteristics.\n\nThis bird survey dataset includes the bird’s common name, scientific name, the corresponding Victorian Biodiversity Atlas Code, the date the survey was conducted, and the location of the survey (including the latitude and longitude). The Victorian Biodiversity Atlas (VBA) is managed by the Department of Environment, Land, Water and Planning (DELWP) and provides a list of species observations in Victoria. Each species has an identification ‘code’ number.\n\nPlease get in contact with the Urban Forest and Ecology Team (nature@melbourne.vic.gov.au) if you wish to view the full report by Ecology Australia or if you have any questions about the dataset.",

    "description": "This dataset is a component of the 'Jervis Bay Baseline Studies' project conducted by the Department of Defence, CSIRO and the Australian Defence Force Academy. \n\nApproximately once per month between 1988-1991, temperature-salinity surveys were conducted within Jervis Bay and out across the continental shelf. Measurements were made using a Neil Brown 'Smart' CTD. On each day of sampling, ~10 stations were chosen across the shelf, with the CTD recorder measuring salinity, temperature and sigma-T through the water column.\n\nThis record describes CTD data collected in 1990. For each day of sampling three resources are provided: 1) A text document providing details of sampling locations, as well as a CTD summary collected from each of the stations every 4-10 metres down the water column, 2) A map showing the location of each sampling station and, 3) An excel file providing the raw CTD data collected.\n\nThis is one of nine child records that relate to the parent, 13391430-2ae8-11dd-a735-00188b4c0af8. A pdf outlining the structure and hierarchy of all metadata records relating to this project is available to download through this record. Also available is a pdf of a published working paper documenting this experiment and the results.",

    "description": "Rodrigues is located at latitude 19°43' S and longitude 63°25' E in the Southwest Indian Ocean and features the best developed reefs in the Mascarenes. \n\nIn 2001 a field expedition to Rodrigues recovered six drill cores using a portable hydraulic drilling rig. In all, two cores were recovered from the windward margin (cores 10 and 17), with a maximum depth of penetration of 4 m. Four cores were recovered from the leeward margin (8, 14, 15, 18) where the maximum depth penetration attained was 4.2 m. Recovery ranged from 23 to 63 %.\n\nThin sections were made and examined petrographically. Radiocarbon dating was performed on selected corals from the base of each core interpreted to have grown in situ and to be free from intraskeletal contamination.\n\nRadiometric dating suggests that Rodrigues reefs approached sea level between 3.1 ± 0.3 cal kyr BP and 1.3 ± 0.2 cal kyr BP. In fact, the windward margin apparently grew to within 2.5 m of present day sea level by approximately 2.7 ± 0.2 cal kyr BP. The leeward margin approached modern day sea level more recently between 1.3 ± 0.2 cal kyr BP and 2.4 ± 0.3 cal kyr BP. Rates of vertical accretion for the top 4 m of the cores range from 0.46 - 1.96 m / kyr.",

    "description": "The 2013 APS employee census was administered to all available Australian Public Service (APS) employees. This census approach provides a comprehensive view of the APS and ensures no eligible respondents are omitted from the survey sample, removing sampling bias and reducing sample error. The census ran from 15 May to 14 June 2013. Overall, 102,219 employees responded to the employee census, a response rate of 66%. \r\n\r\nPlease be aware that the very large number of respondents to the employee census means these files are up to 200 mb in size. Downloading and opening these files may take some time. \r\n\r\n_TECHNICAL NOTES_ \r\n\r\nThree files are available for download.\r\n\r\n* 2013 APS employee census - Questionnaire: This contains the 2013 APS employee census questionnaire.\r\n\r\n* 2013 APS employee census - 5 point dataset.csv: This file contains individual responses to the 2013 employee census as clean, tabular data as required by data.gov.au. This will need to be used in conjunction with the above document. \r\n\r\n* 2013 APS employee census - 5 point dataset.sav: This file contains individual responses to the 2013 employee census for use with the SPSS software package. \r\n\r\nTo protect the privacy and confidentiality of respondents to the 2013 APS employee census, the datasets provided on data.gov.au include responses to a limited number of demographic or other attribute questions.\r\n\r\nFull citation of this dataset should list the Australian Public Service Commission (APSC) as the author.  \r\n\r\nA recommended short citation is: 2013 APS employee census data, Australian Public Service Commission. \r\n\r\nAny queries can be directed to research@apsc.gov.au.",

Licensed activities require the highest level of regulatory control within the EPA permissions scheme(https://www.epa.vic.gov.au/about-epa/publications/1799-2) (publication 1799 at EPA website). This is due to the potential high risk of harm to human health and the environment.  \n\nAn operating licence is a type of permission issued by EPA. It is a legal document held by a legal entity, whether a person, a company, a statutory corporation or a municipal council, and contains conditions that regulate the risk of harm to human health and environment from the activity at the OL activity site. These conditions address areas including: risk management, record keeping and reporting, waste acceptance and treatment or disposal, air and water discharges, and noise and odour. This dataset mirrors the operating licence data available on EPA's public register, but may not be up to date due to data transfer processes.

    "description": "Data compiled within this feature class is combined extent of the nominated Hinterland sand flat forests and woodlands of the Sydney Basin Bioregion found across the Lower Hunter region (Cessnock, Newcastle, Lake Macquarie, Port Stephens and Maitland LGAs). This data is for the EPBC Act Listed Ecological Communities Mapping in the Lower Hunter project and has been consolidated to help map the extent of Threatened Ecological Communities (TECs) in this area. This data will aid in reviewing and analysing the likelihood of occurrence of EPBC Act listed flora and fauna within the Threatened Ecological Communities, and also support the process of identifying and providing recommendations regarding High Priority Conservation Areas within the region. Recommendations from this data regarding Key Threatening Processes have the potential to impact EPBC Act – listed ecological communities and threatened flora and fauna.\n\n* The GIS mapping data were obtained to inform sustainability planning for the Lower Hunter region, particularly to assist in informing the NSW government review of the NSW Lower Hunter regional strategy and Lower Hunter regional conservation plan.\n* Once this review is complete, the second stage is to undertake a strategic assessment of proposed urban development and related infrastructure corridors. The NSW Government has entered into an agreement with the Commonwealth to conduct a strategic assessment of proposed urban development and related infrastructure corridors.\n* The data provide the best available maps of the regional distribution of two Critically Endangered Ecological Communities protected under national environmental law – the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 (EPBC Act) – as well as the distribution of three vegetation communities nominated for listing as threatened species and ecological communities under the EPBC Act. \n* Vegetation definitions used to map the distribution of the three nominated communities are preliminary and subject to change through the listing determination process. Changes to the definition of a vegetation community may result in changes to the mapped distribution of the community.\n* While reasonable efforts have been made to ensure that the contents of this dataset are factually correct, the Commonwealth does not accept responsibility for the accuracy or completeness of the contents, and shall not be liable for any loss or damage that may be occasioned directly or indirectly through the use of, or reliance on, the contents of this dataset.CC - Attribution (CC BY)\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Australia License.

    "description": "MyHospitals provides performance information for public and private hospitals in Australia. You can also compare the performance of these hospitals and find information about hospitals near you.\nThe annual average number of beds available to be used by an admitted patient was grouped into the following categories: fewer than 50, 50-100, 100-200, 200-500 and more than 500. These data are as reported by states and territories to the NPHED, and are referred to in statistical publications (including Australian hospital statistics) as 'average available beds'. The average number of available beds presented may differ from counts published elsewhere. For example, counts based on bed numbers at a specified date such as 30 June may differ from the average available beds over the reporting period. Comparability of bed numbers can be affected by the range and types of patients treated by a hospital. For example, hospitals may have different proportions of beds available for general versus special purposes (such as beds or cots used exclusively for intensive care). Bed counts also include chairs for same-day admissions.\nData is current as of December 2015. Data sourced from: http://www.myhospitals.gov.au/about-the-data/download-data",

    "description": "This data was collected in August 2011 by the IMOS Ship of Opportunity Underway CO2 Measurement research group on RV Southern Surveyor (IMOS platform code: VLHJ) voyage SS2011_T03.\n\nDeparted: \tHobart, TAS,   Aug 12, 2011\nArrived:   \tFremantle, WA,   Aug 22, 2011\n\nCO2 System Overview:\nThe fugacity of carbon dioxide (fCO2) in surface seawater was measured using a General Oceanics Inc. automated system (Model 8050; Pierrot et al 2009). Seawater is sprayed into an equilibration chamber and CO2 in the headspace gas equilibrates with the seawater. The headspace gas is pumped through a thermoelectric condenser followed by a nafion drying tube before flowing through a Licor 7000 non-dispersive infrared gas analyser used to measure the CO2 mole fraction (XCO2) of the dried air. The gas flow is stopped temporarily for the CO2 measurements, which are made at atmospheric pressure. A set of four CO2 standards that cover the range of CO2 values expected in the ocean are analysed about every four hours to calibrate the gas analyser. The standard gas concentrations are on the WMO-X2007 mole fraction scale for CO2-in-air. Atmospheric XCO2 (dry) is measured after the standards by pumping clean outside air from an intake on the forward mast of the ship. \n\nSeawater intake and ancillary data:\nThe seawater intake is located at about 5.5m depth in the bow of the ship. Sea surface salinity is measured using a thermosalinograph (Seabird Electronics SBE21) located next to the CO2 system. A remote temperature sensor (Seabird Electronics SBE 38) located at the intake is used to measure sea surface temperature (SST). The travel time between the intake and CO2 system is typically about 4 minutes with warming usually less than 0.6ºC. The thermosalinograph water is from the same intake, but the supply lines separate after the intake. A comparison of thermosalinograph and equilibrator temperature records shows the temperature difference in the two lines is generally less than 0.1ºC. The thermosalinograph water line travels outside the ship and is typically warmer than the equilibrator. The travel time in water line to the thermosalinograph is 2.5 minutes faster than to the equilibrator. \n\nMeteorological data, salinity, SST, and ships position and time are taken from the ships logging system. These parameters and the data quality are maintained by the Australian Marine National Facility.",

    "description": "The Victorian Government commissioned Deloitte Access Economics to develop a\nmodel of Victoria’s telecommunications market to provide a tool for government\nand market participants to analyse trends, identify unmet demand and to assist\nin planning for the future. This review is an update of a study undertaken in\n2010 for the then Department of Innovation, Industry and Regional Development\nby Access Economics and Gibson Quai-AAS, with an extension of the projection\nperiod out to 2016.\nThe model contains estimates of current (2011) service coverage, demand for\nservices, expenditure and subscriber numbers for 10 telecommunication service\ncategories, as well as forecasts to 2016. The spatial building block of the\nmodel and the lowest level of reporting is at the level of Local Government\nAreas (LGAs). The model also includes broader regional aggregates, and\ndistinguishes between household and business customers.\nThe timing of this modelling exercise, at the early stages of rollout of the\nFederal Government’s National Broadband Network (NBN) and during a period of\nrapid development of new applications for telecommunications technologies, is\ndesigned to capture and identify recent and forthcoming changes in Victoria’s\ntelecommunications markets. The model has been built with the intention that\nit can be updated in future years, to include updated data and to reflect\nemerging market trends.  ",

    "title": "Seabed Biodiversity on the Continental Shelf of the Great Barrier Reef World Heritage Area 2003 - 2006 (CRC Reef, CSIRO)",
    "description": "This very large study is published in Pitcher et al. (2007). Its purpose was to quantify patterns in seabed biodiversity and inter-reefal environmental conditions throughout the GBR.\n\nThe study had three aims: (1) Assessment of seabed biodiversity on the continental shelf of the Great Barrier Reef World Heritage Area, and assessment of the use of biophysical data as environmental correlates of biodiversity and benthic communities; (2) Mapping bycatch and seabed benthos assemblages in the GBR Region for environmental risk assessment and sustainable management of the Queensland East Coast Trawl Fishery, and (3) Assessment of the performance of acoustic remote sensing for seabed mapping and as a surrogate for biodiversity on the continental shelf of the GBR.\n\nIt contains several large data sets, based on >600 km of towed video, ~100,000 photos, 1150 baited remote underwater videos, echograms, ~14,000 benthic samples, ~4,000 seabed fish samples, and ~1,200 sediment samples.\n\nThe eAtlas has processed the Towed video data into a shapefile [1 MB] for dataset visualisation. This processing was done by combining the start and end tow events from the VESSEL_TASKS_ALL table to create a shapefile (GBR_CSIRO-AIMS_Seabed-biodiversity-2003-2006_DropCam.shp) and CSV (GBR_CSIRO-AIMS_Seabed-biodiversity-2003-2006_DropCam.csv) with a line feature for each tow. The information from tables VESSEL_VIDEO_BIOHABITAT and VESSEL_VIDEO_SUBSTRATUM were added as attributes of the line features based on the matching SITE_ID. \n\n\nFormat:\n\nThe processed data from this study is stored in an Access Database (77 MB). The eAtlas summarised the tow video data into a shapefile [1MB] and CSV files (290 KB). Note the attribute names in the shapefile were truncated to 10 characters due to the limitation of shapfiles.

    "description": "This dataset presents the footprint of the percentage of adults who needed to see a GP but did not in the preceding 12 months. The data spans the years of 2013-2017 and is aggregated to 2015 Department of Health Primary Health Network (PHN) areas, based on the 2011 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nThe data is sourced from the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) 2016-17 Patient Experience Survey, collected between 1 July 2016 and 30 June 2017. It also includes data from previous Patient Experience Surveys conducted in 2013-14, 2014-15 and 2015-16. The Patient Experience Survey is conducted annually by the ABS and collects information from a representative sample of the Australian population. The Patient Experience Survey is one of several components of the Multipurpose Household Survey, as a supplement to the monthly Labour Force Survey. The Patient Experience Survey collects data on persons aged 15 years and over, who are referred to as adults for this data collection.\nFor further information about this dataset, visit the data source:Australian Institute of Health and Welfare - Patient experiences in Australia Data Tables.\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data using the Department of Health - PHN Areas.\n\n\nPercentages are calculated based on counts that have been randomly adjusted by the ABS to avoid the release of confidential data.\n\n\nAs an indication of the accuracy of estimates, 95% confidence intervals were produced. These were calculated by the ABS using standard error estimates of the proportion.\n\n\nSome of the patient experience measures for 2016-17 have age-standardised rates presented. Age-standardised rates are hypothetical rates that would have been observed if the populations studied had the same age distribution as the standard population.\n\n\nCrude rates are provided for all years. They should be used for understanding the patterns of actual service use or level of experience in a particular PHN.\n\n\nThe Patient Experience Survey excludes persons aged less than 15 years, persons living in non-private dwellings and the Indigenous Community Strata (encompassing discrete Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities).\n\n\nData for Northern Territory should be interpreted with caution as the Patient Experience Survey excluded the Indigenous Community Strata, which comprises around 25% of the estimated resident population of the Northern Territory living in private dwellings.\n\n\nRows that contain a \"#\" in \"Interpret with Caution\" indicates that the estimate has a relative standard error of 25% to 50%, which indicates a high level of sampling error relative to its value and must be taken into account when comparing this estimate with other values.\n\n\nNP - Not available for publication. The estimate is considered to be unreliable. Values assigned to NP in the original data have been set to null.\n\n",

    "description": "Between 1990-1993, the native vegetation communities in the bushland of Hornsby Shire were identified and mapped. The present study, carried out between 2006 and 2008, updates the classification and mapping of the communities.\nThe survey area included all of the Hornsby LGA, from Eastwood to Brooklyn to Wisemans Ferry, excluding Marramarra NP, Muogamarra NR, Long Island NR, and Ku-ring-gai Chase NP east of the Sydney-Newcastle Freeway.\nIn the initial study, the classification of the plant communities was based on the floristic composition of the tallest vegetation layer (usually the tree species composition). The assessment was subjective but based on species data from a total of 404 sample sites. An additional 209 sites were examined for the updated study. The classification has been refined to include 8 EECs, two rainforest communities (instead of one in the original classification), and recognition of the distinctive vegetation of Dangar Island as a separate community.\nVIS_ID 4471\nPlease note the related datasets:\n1.

If this occurs, the area is put under a moratorium to halt any further development, while the area is further investigated.\nIf it is decided that the area requires water usage monitoring, then the area may be prescribed. When an area is prescribed, the linework is removed from this layer and placed in the Prescribed areas layer. This coverage contains the linework of those areas which are under moratorium. This linework is used as a base for policy and investigates projects to determine whether prescribing is appropriate.

    "title": "Queensland - National Intertidal-Subtidal Benthic NISB Habitat Map (PLUS)",
    "description": "The NISB Habitat Map was created by the University of Tasmania for a partnership between the Department of Climate Change and the National Land and Water Resources Audit. It supports the DCC/Audit partnership by providing a nationally consistent set of the available mapping data for those habitats that occur between the approximate position of the highest astronomical tide mark (HAT) and the location of the outer limit of the photic benthic zone (approximately at the 50-70 m depth contour). This area is broadly equivalent to the 'inner' and 'mid-shelf' regions identified by Geoscience Australia. The resulting map data set forms a core component of the ECM National Habitat Map Series. The habitat classes include: coral reef, rock dominated habitat, sediment dominated habitat, mangroves, saltmarsh, seagrass, macroalgae and filter feeders (e.g. sponges), as defined in the NISB Habitat Classification Scheme. The scheme is designed to support the development of marine 'ecoregions' or bioregional subregions. Details of the scheme and the process of its development are available in National Intertidal/Subtidal Benthic (NISB) Habitat Classification Scheme Version 1 (Mount, Bricher and Newton, 2007). The NISB Habitat Map consists of two layers for each state. _NISB.shp consists of the entire available habitat mapping at a resolution finer than 1:50 000 (with a few exceptions, outlined in the data quality section below). _NISB_PLUS.shp consists of all the data in _NISB.shp along with coarser resolution data, including NVIS and OzEstuaries data. These layers were used to produce the National ECM Key Habitat Distribution Map Series 10 km and 50 km tile maps.\r\n\r\nNote: This data is labelled as “NISB_plus”, indicating that it is the NISB Habitat layer plus other lower quality layers.",

    "description": "The Australian Continuous Plankton Recorder (AusCPR) survey is a joint project between CSIRO Oceans and Atmosphere (O&amp;A) and the Australian Antarctic Division (AAD) to measure plankton communities as a guide to the health of Australia's oceans. The biomass is analysed from the same segment from which the zooplankton is analysed. All the plankton is washed onto a pre-weighed filter. This is left in an oven at 60 degrees C for 24-48 hours.  It is reweighed to give the dry weight. It is advised that anyone using the data should contact the project contact person. The aims of the AusCPR survey are to: * map plankton biodiversity and distribution * develop the first long-term plankton baseline for Australian waters * document plankton changes in response to climate change * provide indices for fisheries management * detect harmful algal blooms * validate satellite remote sensing * initialise and test ecosystem models.  Servicing and maintenance of the CPRs and analysis of the samples for the AusCPR survey will be carried out by staff based at the O&amp;A CSIRO laboratories in Queensland and Hobart and at the AAD in Hobart. The project was funded by the Integrated Marine Observing System (IMOS) and falls with the Ships of Opportunity facility. Data storage and access is planned to be interoperable with other national and international programs through the IMOS Infrastructure. Results from the AusCPR survey are available through the AODN portal: https://portal.aodn.org.au. This data is freely available but please acknowledge all relevant parties, as detailed in acknowledgement section.",

    "description": "The Cooks River catchment is a major watershed within Sydney, draining some 103 km2 and is home to 560,265 people (ABS, 2020). As such, Cooks River is a key catchment in terms of floodplain risk management within New South Wales. The Cooks River catchment extends across multiple Local Government Areas (LGAs) and is of interest to several other state government agencies and community groups. \n\nThis project is the Cooks River Catchment Flood Study Stage 1 and is the first stage of a catchment-wide Flood Study for the Cooks River catchment. Stage 1 aims to consolidate an \nextensive range of datasets, including existing models from Flood Studies and Floodplain Risk Management Studies and Plans. Many of these studies have been supported by the NSW Floodplain Risk Management Program, whilst some have been separately undertaken. The outcome of Stage 1 is a framework to support the development of an integrated and regional floodplain risk management plan in the catchment and to define the basis of future modelling and catchment-wide consideration of flood risk.

They include most of the denser areas with small property polygons, but they can include larger blocks for the convenience of simplifying the boundaries.\n\nAs far as practicable they have been aligned to property boundaries, so a property is either \"inside\" or \"outside\". There are some exceptions for features such as rivers, and multi-part polygons which may have widely separated parts. \n\nThis dataset is used to create the property_view_dvp and parcel_view_dvp datasets. These datasets have a \"display\" column which can be used to limit the display of the property or parcel polygons to appropriate scales. These datasets can be used to improve the efficiency of web mapping.\n\nThe polygons will be updated on an occasional basis to include newly subdivided areas.",

Volume 2 details the results of flood behaviour studies of\neach of the creeks.\n\nUndertaking of the flood studies on the creeks was an important first step in the process of\npreparing the FRMP. The flood study is the formal starting process of defining management\nmeasures for flood liable land and represents a detailed technical investigation of flood\nbehaviour.\n\nThis Volume describes the method and results of the investigation to define flooding conditions\non the catchments under both present day conditions and after development according to\nCouncil’s current zoning policy. The study then reviews the impacts of flooding on existing urban\ndevelopment and improvements to the drainage system which could be implemented to mitigate\nflood impacts.",

    "description": "\n## **Abstract** \nThe dataset was compiled by the Geological and Bioregional Assessment Program from multiple sources referenced within the dataset and/or metadata. The processes undertaken to compile this dataset are described in the History field in this metadata statement. The dataset was developed to assist in the classification of permanent waterholes in the Cooper GBA region.\n\n\n## **Attribution** \nGeological and Bioregional Assessment Program\n\n\n## **History** \nThe dataset contains two shapefiles. The first (COO_Lakes_WH_WFS.shp) contains all the lakes and waterholes identified in the 250K topo maps and uses the Water Observations From Space dataset to find the pixel within each polygon that has the maximum proportion of time inundated (MAX field). Waterholes that are inundated more than 70% of the time (MAX>0.70) are considered to be semi-permanent, those that are inundated more than 95% (MAX>0.95) are considered to be permanent. The second dataset (perm_WH_DTWT.shp) is looking at the depth to water table beneath waterholes. There are no dedicated observation bore networks to look at groundwater levels beneath waterholes so this dataset is using the closest water level observation up to a maximum of 5 km away. The field NEAR_DIST is the distance of the bore from the waterhole and the field WH_DTWT is the  depth to water table below the waterhole assuming that the groundwater level is the same as that in the borehole within 5 km. A positive value in WH_DTWT means that the groundwater level is below the water level of the waterhole, a negative value means that the groundwater level is above the water level of the water hole.",

    "description": "This collection consists of the model set-up used to develop an initial capability for modelling biological nitrification inhibition (BNI) in APSIM Next Generation and a preliminary evaluation of BNI in wheat, canola, sorghum and maize systems across Australian grain regions. To generate the data, an extensive literature review of BNI was undertaken. Based on the available evidence, an APSIM-BNI module was developed using APSIM Manager script and integrated into APSIM. The APSIM-BNI module was evaluated for model sensibility, parameter sensitivity and uncertainty. The developed APSIM-BNI module was then used in a scenario analysis to quantify the plausible impact of BNI on both productivity and emissions from Australian farming systems. This collection includes APSIMX file with BNI manager script, simulation output in csv formats. The output variables reported either daily, seasonal or annual include soil carbon, soil mineral nitrogen, nitrogen loss pathways, soil water, crop biomass, N uptake yield, and gross margins.  ",
