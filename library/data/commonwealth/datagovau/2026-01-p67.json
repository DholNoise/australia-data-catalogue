    "title": "Parent record: Flow patterns within Jervis Bay: Summer deployment of current meters and tidal gauges",
    "description": "This record describes components of the 'Jervis Bay Baseline Studies' project conducted by the Department of Defence, CSIRO and Australian Defence Force Academy (ADFA). The initial aims of the project were to obtain current and wind observations from Jervis bay over a six week period in order to detail the wind driven circulation and provide a data set for comparison with the numerical modelling work being simultaneously undertaken. However, after this initial experiment it became clear that there were significant currents in the bay that are not simply related to direct wind forcing. Therefore, alternative mechanisms for driving the flow had to be investigated, through the measurement programs and data analysis, as well as through numerical modelling. The result was a series of approximately six separate experiments aiming to define the water circulation around the bay and through the bay entrance, to gain an understanding of the processes that drive the currents, and to investigate the influence of stratification on the nature of the currents.\n\nThe first of these six experiments concentrated on the flow patterns within the bay during the summer months, when the waters are normally thermally stratified. This experiment consisted of 8 current meters in 3 moorings within the bay, along with pressure gauges to measure water levels and a meteorological station measuring winds and atmospheric pressure at Governor Head. The moorings were maintained for a single deployment from 6th December 1988 to 11th January 1989. [Given that this meteorological data bridges all six experiments, the data collected is described in a separate metadata record and will not be considered further.]\n\nThe black, yellow and orange moorings held tidal gauges, while the red, blue and green moorings held current meters at various depths. The red mooring held current meters at ~6.5m, 10.5m, 14.5m and 18.5m, while the blue mooring held meters at ~5.5m and 11.5m and the green mooring at ~5.5m and 9.5m.\n\nAs this is a parent record, no data is available to download. A pdf outlining the structure and hierarchy of metadata records relating to this project is available through this record. Also available is a pdf of a published working paper documenting this experiment and the results.  There are four subsidiary records that directly relate to this parent, through which the data is provided (see hierarchical tree): \n30915440-c321-11dc-9e24-00188b4c0af8\nc5340590-c3b5-11dc-8135-00188b4c0af8\na4d79ad0-c3c1-11dc-8135-00188b4c0af8\n08d650b0-c3f1-11dc-8135-00188b4c0af8",

Groundwater bores were sampled as part of field trips in 2019 and 2020, with additional samples provided by Santos; the dataset includes chemistry and tracer data from Cooper Basin production bores and GAB bores. \n\n\n## **Attribution** \nGeological and Bioregional Assessment Program\n\n\n## **History** \nThis dataset contains field parameters and laboratory analyses of chemistry and environmental tracers on groundwater and gas production bores in the Cooper and Eromanga basins collected from within the Cooper GBA region in QLD and SA. Water samples were collected during two field campaigns in 2019 and 2020, with production waters provided by Santos. Water chemistry data includes general field parameters (e.g. pH, EC and redox potential) and laboratory results, including major and minor ions analysed using a combination of ion chromatography, inductively coupled plasma - optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES) and inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). Environmental tracer data contained in this dataset includes 222Rn, 2H, 18O, 87Sr/86Sr, methane concentrations and isotopes, He, Ne, Ar, Kr and Xe which were analysed using a range of specialised analytical equipment at a variety of laboratories.",

    "description": "Urban Habitat Connectivity Project (UHCP)\n\nShort description: A package of data containing potential habitat and fragmentation for seven species groups in the urban ACT. Each species group has two layer files. Connected habitat layers show potential core and corridor habitat for the species group, and connectivity/fragmentation between these habitat patches. Remnant patches layers contain areas which are predicted to be fragmented and inaccessible for the species group, but may be important for restoration activities. These layers are outputs of ecological connectivity modelling and have been developed using spatial data representing habitat and connectivity requirements specific to the species group.\n\nThe following attributes are available in the data table for Connected Habitat layers:\n\n\n<ul><li>Species Group* - indicates the species group of interest</li><li>Patch ID – a unique identifier for each ‘patch’ of connected habitat, an ID that is given to group all habitat areas which are predicted to be connected to each other.</li><li>Habitat Type* – identifies if the polygon meets core or corridor habitat requirements, or if it is a remnant patch.</li><li>Habitat Number – a numeric value linked to Habitat Type to support statistics and symbology. Core habitat has a value of 0 and corridor habitat has a value of 1.</li><li>Patch Area (Ha)* – the area of the individual polygon in hectares.</li><li>Connected Habitat Area (Ha) – the total area of potential habitat in the connected patch, determined by summing the Patch Area for all polygons with the same Patch ID.</li><li>Shape area – the polygon’s area, calculated by default in meters squared.</li><li>Shape length – the length of the line enclosing the polygon, calculated by default in meters squared.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n* Is also available in the data table for Remnant Patches layers.\n\nSpatial resolution: 1:10,000\n\nCoordinate system: GDA2020 MGA zone 55\n\nMETHODS\n\nData collection / creation: <a>Spatial layers for habitat and barriers were created and input into a habitat connectivity/fragmentation model specifically designed for the species group. The model was developed using metrics derived from expert elicitation. These metrics quantified essential habitat and connectivity requirements for the species group, for example the preferred spacing of trees, the maximum crossable width of a road, the typical dispersal distance, etc. </a>The model identified habitat and barriers to connectivity, based on the metrics which could be mapped. Habitat was delineated by patch size to determine core and corridor habitat, and to remove areas which are too small to be functional. The habitat type is visible in the attribute table of the data.\n\nConnectivity between habitat patches is dependent on the species group’s dispersal capacity and the availability of core habitat, suitable corridors and a path without barriers. To assess this core habitat areas were buffered by the species group’s dispersal distance. This identified how far an individual will move to find a new core habitat patch. Movement to this distance is dependent on a suitable path. All habitat was buffered by the distance the species can move outside habitat (through non-habitat areas). This identified how far an individual will move outside any habitat (core or corridor) before they require another habitat patch (i.e. how far they can travel between stepping stones).Connectivity is further complicated by impassable barriers. Barriers were used to slice up the dispersal buffers and identify ‘dispersal patches’, areas which an individual can move within. Fragmentation is seen when a barrier is present, patches are too far from core habitat, or corridor habitat is too far apart.\n\nA unique ID was applied to each patch and represents connectivity/fragmentation. The patches were intersected with habitat to apply the new ID to the habitat areas. The final model outputs identify areas of potential core, corridor or remnant (inaccessible) habitat. Core and corridor habitat are viewable in the connected habitat dataset, whilst remnant patches are available separately. The data was simplified using the Douglas-Peuker algorithm, a tolerance of 0.5-2m, minimum size of 2-5m2 for retention, and holes filled in if less than 20m2. Small adjoining slithers &lt;20m2 were dissolved into neighbouring polygons to optimise drawing speeds. Please contact the project team for the model script or further details on the methodology.\n\nNOTES ON USE\n\nQuality: The habitat connectivity modelling used to produce the data was informed by work by the City of Melbourne <a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/331035992_Linking_Nature_in_the_City_A_framework_for_improving_ecological_connectivity_across_the_City_of_Melbourne\">(Kirk et al., 2018)</a>. The original methods were expanded on, with habitat and connectivity requirements (metrics) specific to the species group determined from expert elicitation and further analysis to consider patch size for core or corridor patches. The expert elicitation process provided the best and most relevant quantitative description of habitat and barriers available (for a species group rather than a specific species). The input datasets were then tailored to the metrics for this project. Existing datasets were refined to be relevant and reflect the metrics identified through expert elicitation. New datasets were created where data was missing. All data was derived from existing authoritative sources and/or remotely sensed data. This data curation process ensured the input datasets, and resulting output, were relevant and fit for purpose.\n\nLimitations: This data should be considered indicative only as there are limitations to the modelling process. It considers all habitat and barriers equally and as discrete objects (i.e. it applies a discrete boundary around a patch and does not account for gradients or flexible boundaries).The model predicts habitat and connectivity based on the data available. It does not assess whether a species is present or consider temporal variability. Some habitat requirements are not mapped (e.g. native vegetation, lack of predators) due to the lack of an accurate or complete dataset. Some of these requirements are critical to the success of the species group. These habitat requirements are available and have been derived from expert elicitation. They should be considered at an area of interest.\n\nThe model assumes the input data is up to date and accurate. Many of the habitat and barrier datasets used as inputs into the models are in some way informed by remote sensing data. Remote sensing data has limitations, such as potential for misclassification (e.g. bare ground and pavement could be confused). Additionally, remotely sensed data captures a point in time and will become outdated. Manual checks and improvements using supplementary data for specific sites have been completed to reduce as much error as possible.\n\nData refinement: Unmapped habitat and connectivity requirements should be considered when using the data. The full list of known habitat and connectivity requirements for each species group, including those considered by the model and those unaccounted for, is available by request. Other data may also be used to track changes post-LiDAR capture. For example, new development footprints may be used to remove non-habitat areas and can be done so at a faster rate than waiting for new LiDAR captures and re-running the model.\n\n\n\nSHARING\n\nLicenses/restrictions on use: Creative Commons By Attribution 4.0 (Australian Capital Territory)\n\nHow to cite this data: ACT Government, 2023.

    "description": "This dataset presents the footprint of cancer incidence statistics in Australia for all cancers combined and the 6 top cancer groupings (colorectal, leukaemia, lung, lymphoma, melanoma of the skin and pancreas) and their respective ICD-10 codes. The data spans the years 2006-2010 and is aggregated to 2015 Department of Health Primary Health Network (PHN) areas, based on the 2011 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nIncidence data refer to the number of new cases of cancer diagnosed in a given time period. It does not refer to the number of people newly diagnosed (because one person can be diagnosed with more than one cancer in a year). Cancer incidence data come from the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare (AIHW) 2012 Australian Cancer Database (ACD).\nFor further information about this dataset, please visit:\n\n\nAustralian Institute of Health and Welfare - Cancer Incidence and Mortality Across Regions (CIMAR) books.\n\n\nAustralian Cancer Database 2012 Data Quality Statement.\n\n\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data using the Department of Health - PHN Areas.\n\n\nDue to changes in geographic classifications over time, long-term trends are not available.\n\n\nValues assigned to \"n.p.\" in the original data have been removed from the data.\n\n\nThe Australian and jurisdictional totals include people who could not be assigned a PHN. The number of people who could not be assigned a PHN is less than 1% of the total.\n\n\nThe Australian total also includes residents of Other Territories (Cocos (Keeling) Islands, Christmas Island and Jervis Bay Territory).\n\n\nThe ACD records all primary cancers except for basal and squamous cell carcinomas of the skin (BCCs and SCCs). These cancers are not notifiable diseases and are not collected by the state and territory cancer registries.\n\n\nThe diseases coded to ICD-10 codes D45-D46, D47.1 and D47.3-D47.5, which cover most of the myelodysplastic and myeloproliferative cancers, were not considered cancer at the time the ICD-10 was first published and were not routinely registered by all Australian cancer registries. The ACD contains all cases of these cancers which were diagnosed from 1982 onwards and which have been registered but the collection is not considered complete until 2003 onwards.\n\n\nNote that the incidence data presented are for 2006-2010 because 2011 and 2012 data for NSW and ACT were not able to be provided for the 2012 ACD.\n\n",

    "description": "\nThis map contains district-based ACT canopy cover polygons at 1m resolution (vegetation cover above 3m) as at April/May 2020, detected with Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR). The full ACT vector dataset has been split into districts and 1km tiles to allow for easier viewing.\n<strong>WARNING: Due to</strong><strong> complexity and high resolution this dataset </strong><strong>may draw slowly or appear to miss some trees. For best results, zoom in, view single districts separately, or download a local copy.</strong>\nLIDAR data was acquired in April/May 2020 for the ACT under contract by Aerometrex, at an average resolution of 12ppm. LiDAR is classified to Level 3 (for ground) and delivered as LAS v1.4 in in GDA2020 MGA zone 55. Visit <a href=\"https://www.planning.act.gov.au/professionals/survey-spatial/spatial-information/lidar-data\">https://www.planning.act.gov.au/professionals/survey-spatial/spatial-information/lidar-data</a> for more info. Processing was completed on the LAS GDA2020 MGA Zone 55 LAS tile set using AHD vertical datum at 1m resolution. Dataset represents high vegetation above 3m (tree canopy or tree-approximate objects - see caveats).\nMethodology:<ul><li>High noise errors were reclassified.</li><li>Digital Surface Model (DSM) and Digital Elevation Model (DEM) surfaces were created using ArcPro 2.8 LAS Dataset Geoprocessing Tools at 1 m resolution.</li><li>Canopy Height Model CHM was determined = Digital Surface Model (DSM) - Digital Elevation Model (DEM).</li><li>Pits (empty cells inside tree canopies) of 2 pixel (2x1m) were removed using Nibble.</li><li>An ACT Urban building footprint layer generated from the 2020 LIDAR dataset by Aerometrex was used to remove spurious canopy portions from building roof areas in the urban area.</li><li>An NDVI layer from pan-sharpened Pleiades multispectral satellite imagery, acquired in April 2019 (the Uriarra area) and November 2019 (rest of Urban Area) was used to delete erroneous non-vegetative surfaces in urban areas.</li><li>Canopy holes &lt;=1m2 were filled by Eliminate tool.</li><li>GDA2020 MGA Zone 55.</li><li>Tree canopy lower than 3m were removed. Converted to a binary raster, then converted to vector.</li></ul>\n\nOther available datasets: ACT 2020 Canopy Height Model (raster), ACT Trees (Individual Delineated Trees with Height) (vector), DEM, DSM, Contours, Building Footprints (© Australian Capital Territory &amp; Aerometrex Limited), ACT Permeability, shrub cover - contact spatialdata@act.gov.au. Full LAS Tile sets can also be obtained in the following vertical datums: GDA2020 ellipsoidal, AHD, AVWS - see <a href=\"https://elevation.fsdf.org.au/\">https://elevation.fsdf.org.au/</a>. Other derivative products (including other canopy products) are available on request or through the ACT <a href=\"https://actmapi-actgov.opendata.arcgis.com\">Geospatial Data Catalogue</a>.\nRoad, Block and Division Canopy 2020 Statistics also available here: <a href=\"https://actmapi-actgov.opendata.arcgis.com/maps/act-canopy-cover-2020-statistics/about\">https://actmapi-actgov.opendata.arcgis.com/maps/act-canopy-cover-2020-statistics/about</a>\nCaveats:1. Please note that most (if not all) CHM-based tree delineation results should be thought of as &quot;tree-approximate objects&quot;, and not actual trees. 2. Although every effort was made to remove any erroneous polygons (such as street lights, back yard fences and powerlines), there are likely to be some errors remaining.\nCreative Commons by Attribution (CCBY) 4.0 (Australian Capital Territory).

    "description": "The operational map for Tablelands Snow Gum, Black Sallee, Candlebark and Ribbon Gum Grassy Woodland (Tableland Snow Gum or TSG) was constructed to resolve long-standing issues surrounding its identification, location and extent within the NSW State Forest estate covered by the eastern Regional Forest Agreements. The determination of TSG was reviewed by the project’s Threatened Ecological Community (TEC) Reference Panel (the Panel), and a set of diagnostic parameters for identifying the TSG TEC was agreed upon. These parameters included the bioregions in which TSG is likely to be located in, landscape features such as elevation and geology, and quantitative floristic attributes from vegetation communities explicitly listed in the determination.\nUsing these diagnostic parameters, we defined the study area as being all IBRA subregions that cover the 600-1400m elevation range within the South Eastern Highlands, Sydney Basin, South East Corner and Australian Alps bioregions. We then compiled floristic plot data for all State Forest areas within our study area. Floristic plot data was sourced from both existing flora surveys held in the OEH VIS database and from targeted flora surveys conducted specifically for this project. We compared these plots with those previously assigned to flora communities listed in the determination of TSG. Both dissimilarity-based methods and multivariate regression methods were used for the comparison. The results of the comparison were then used to assess the likelihood that the plots in State forests belonged to one or more of the communities listed in the TSG determination.\nWe also conducted presence-absence predictive distribution modelling to identify potential distributions of each of the primary vegetation communities cited in the determination for TSG. The modelling predicted the likelihood of occurrence for each community across State Forests in the study area based on a modelled relationship with environmental and remotely sensed variables. As such, the modelling assisted in identifying un-surveyed areas of potential TSG habitat and guiding follow-up survey efforts and aerial photography interpretation (API) work.\nAPI assessment was carried out for all State Forests where the predictive modelling identified areas with high probability-of-occurrence values. We used recent high resolution stereo digital imagery in a digital 3D GIS environment to delineate areas of potential TSG based on observable patterns in canopy species dominance, understorey characteristics and landform elements. \nWe constructed the operational map by assigning our API polygons as being TSG based on the extent to which the floristic plots within or near to each API polygon belonged to TSG. We used a precautionary approach and assessed a mapped polygon as TSG if the map unit to which it belonged contained any TSG plot. \nOperational TEC Mapping have been derived by API at a viewing scale between 1-4000 using ADS40 50 cm pixel imagery and 1 m derived LIDAR DEM grids for floodplain EECs.",

    "description": "<b>This spreadsheet replicates selected data tables from the ACT &amp; Queanbeyan Household Travel Survey dashboard.</b>\nPlease refer to the attached spreadsheet on this page.\n\n<b>About the Active Travel theme</b>\nActive travel relates to any trips made by <b>walking or cycling</b>.\n\nWhile active transport is often used to describe the combined benefits of walking and cycling, the willingness and opportunity to use either mode will naturally differ depending on the person and their travel context. \n\nAs expected, this theme highlights that there is a much higher proportion of walk trips compared to bicycle. Closer examination of the data also reveals socio-demographic variability in active travel choices. For example, two-thirds of cycling trips are made by males. \n\nAs well as trip counts, data is also summarised by trip percentages. This can be the mode share for each analysis group (e.g., holding each cohort constant, such as 'all females', and examining their use of walking compared to cycling) <b>or</b> the use of each mode across groups (e.g., holding mode constant, such as 'all walk trips', and examining the distribution of these across males and females). Both summaries are provided on separate tabs.\n\nNote that the tables provided represent a small subset of data available. Use of the dashboard or raw survey datasets allow more complex descriptions of travel to be developed.\n\n<b>Source data</b>\nThe data shown is not a Census of travel, but a large survey of several thousand households from across the ACT and Queanbeyan. As with any survey there will be some variability in the accuracy of the results, and how well they reflect the movement of the entire population. For instance, if the survey were to be completed on another day, or with a different subset of households, the results would be slightly different. \nInterpretations of the data should keep this variability in mind: these are estimates of the broad shape of travel only. Even for the same person, travel behaviour will vary according to many factors: day of week, month of year, season, weather, school holidays, illness, family responsibilities, work from home opportunities, etc. Again, by summarising the travel of many different people, the data provides a view of average weekday patterns.\n\nIn interpreting the data, it is worth noting the following points:\n-    A zero cell does not necessarily mean the travel is never made, but rather that the survey participants did not make this travel on their particular survey day.\n-    Values are rounded, and may not sum to the totals shown.\nTrip time periods are assigned using the mid point of travel:\n-   AM peak (8am to 9am), PM peak (5pm to 6pm), Interpeak (9am to 5pm), Off-peak (after 6pm)\n\nThe small sample size (approximately 1 per cent) of people who either did not report their gender, or who did not identify as male or female, prevented their analysis as a distinct cohort group. Responses from these participants have been randomly allocated to the male and female groups.\n\nHousehold income quartiles are derived by a summation of individual income ranges. As no adjustment has been made for household size, single person households are over-represented in the lowest income quartile.\nAn employment status of 'Not in workforce' is only applied to children. Retired people will be classed as 'Not employed'.\n\nThe survey is described on the Transport Canberra and City Services' website:\n<a href=\"https://www.transport.act.gov.au/planning-for-the-future/household-travel-survey\">[Household Travel Survey homepage]</a>\n\n<b>Cell annotations and notes</b>\nSome cells have annotations added to them, as follows:\n*    : Statistically significant difference across survey years (at the 95% confidence level). Confidence intervals indicate where the true measure would typically fall if the survey were repeated multiple times (i.e., 95 times out of 100), recognising that each survey iteration may produce slightly different outcomes.\n~    : Un",

    "description": "Ice thickness measurements were made in 1961 by seismic methods on a line southward from S-2, a glaciological station 50 miles east-south-east of Wilkes Base, Antarctica. The traverse constituted the first year's work of a three-year programme. The results showed that the rock underlying the ice dips below sea level at a point between 20 and 40 miles south of S-2. It remains below sea level at all the locations occupied to the south, as far as 280 miles south of S-2, where the rock surface is again above sea level. The main feature is a valley disclosed in the rock formation between 40 and 80 miles south of S-2. Midway between these two points the rock lies at approximately 7500 ft below sea level. The positions of the Totten Glacier and the John Quincy Adams Glacier suggest that the valley may have been responsible for their formation.",

    "description": "    \r\n\r\nThe maps represent a compilation of dryland salinity risk and hazard mapping\r\nfor 2000, 2020 and 2050. The map shows the broad distribution of areas\r\nconsidered as having either a high salinity risk or a high salinity hazard. In\r\nsouthern Australia where groundwater level and trend data are available,\r\nassessments that are more confident have been possible. However, in northern\r\nAustralia groundwater data for trend analysis are very sparse or non-existent.\r\nIn these regions, salinity assessments have been based on the presence of\r\ngeological, landscape, regolith, land use and climate attributes which are the\r\nprime drivers of salinity. This national map provides a basis for identifying\r\nthose regions where more detailed assessments are warranted, and where land\r\nuse changes should be targeted if the risks are to be managed.The bulk of non-\r\nagricultural areas in Western Australia, South Australia and western New South\r\nWales were considered to have a very low salinity risk and were not\r\nassessed.Please note that the Commonwealth and all suppliers of source data\r\nused to derive the maps of aAustralia, Forecast Areas Containing Land of High\r\nHazard or Risk of Dryland Salinity from 2000 to 2050a3 do not warrant the\r\naccuracy or completedness of information in this product. Any person using or\r\nrelying upon such information does so on the basis that the Commonwealth and\r\ndata suppliers shall bear no responsibility or liability whatsoever for any\r\nerrors, faults, defects or omissions in the information.\r\n\r\nSee [further metadata](http://data.daff.gov.au/anrdl/metadata_files/pa_dsa__r9nn\r\nd_00211a00.xml) for more detail.\r\n\r\n",

    "description": "#Updated September 2021 to include land use tiles. These tiles address issues with analysis of the large single dataset.#\r\n\r\nThis vector dataset is a compilation of land use data for Western Australia, as at August 2018. It has been derived from various vector datasets with attribution relevant to land use in Western Australia. The date of mapping (2008 to 2018) and scale of mapping (1:5 000 to 1:250 000) vary, reflecting the source data, capture date and scale. \r\n\r\nThe data shows a single dominant land use for a given area, based on the primary management objective of the land manager. As a seamless spatial dataset for Western Australia, it can be used to identify, map and analyse high level land use categories (such as nature conservation, dryland cropping and irrigated horticulture) and more specific land use categories (such as aquaculture and tree fruits) including some commodities (such as bananas). These categories can be extracted or combined with other spatial datasets to provide new insights and analysis concerning land use in Western Australia. \r\n\r\nLand use is classified according to the Australian Land Use and Management (ALUM) Classification version 8, a three-tiered hierarchical structure. There are five primary classes, identified in order of increasing levels of intervention or potential impact on the natural landscape. Water is included separately as a sixth primary class. Primary and secondary levels relate to the principal land use. Tertiary classes may include additional information on commodity groups, specific commodities, land management practices or vegetation information. The primary, secondary and tertiary codes work together to provide increasing levels of detail about the land use. Land may be subject to a number of concurrent land uses. For example, while the main management objective of a multiple-use production forest may be timber production, it may also provide conservation, recreation, grazing and water catchment land uses. In these cases, production forestry is commonly identified in the ALUM code as the prime land use. \r\n\r\nThe operational scales of the mapping vary according to the intensity of land use activities and landscape context. Scales range from 1:5 000 and 1:25 000 for irrigated and peri-urban areas, to 1:100 000 for broadacre cropping regions and 1:250 000 for the semi-arid and arid pastoral zone. The scale of mapping generally reflects the intensity of land use. \r\n\r\nThe vector geodatabase has been cut into 7 shapefile tiles. This reduces the file size and enables more analysis. The extent of tiles is shown below:  \r\n•\tSwan Natural Resource Management region,\r\n•\tSouth West Natural Resource Management region,\r\n•\tSouth Coast Natural Resource Management region,\r\n•\tNorthern Agricultural Region Natural Resource Management region,\r\n•\tPeel Harvey Natural Resource Management region,\r\n•\tAvon Natural Resource Management region,\r\n•\tRangelands Natural Resource Management region\r\n",

Monitoring is carried out by three different boat-based sampling parties, but is co-ordinated to occur on the same day each month. \nAt each site, in-situ field measurements are taken using calibrated sensors for temperature, salinity, pH, dissolved oxygen and turbidity. Water clarity is also measured using a secchi disk. Surface and bottom water samples are collected for analysis of true color, total suspended solids(TSS), total  and dissolved nutrients, organic carbon and zinc. at most sites, depth integrated samples are also collected for chlorophyll a using a plastic tube. Bottom samples in the Middle and Outer estuary are collected using a niskin bottle. Pumps are used in the upper estuary site to fill up the bottles. All water samples are analysed at Analytical Service Tasmania, a National Association of Testing Authorities-accredited laboratory. Monitoring site depth is 2 meters",

The echosounder's nominal frequency is 400 kHz (with a range of 200-700 kHz) and it operated in dual swath mode. \nData are stored in .kmall raw format for bathymetry and backscatter and .kmwcd format for watercolumn backscatter at CSIRO. There are 158 files totalling 71.3 GB of raw data and 146 files totalling 424 GB of watercolumn data in this dataset. \nSound velocity profiles were applied to this data during data acquisition. Bathymetry data contained in *.kmall format are corrected for motion and position. \nGPS tide was computed using the EGM2008 model and applied to the processed data. Processed data has had outliers removed. \nAdditional information regarding this dataset, including further information on processing streams, is contained in the GSM data acquisition and processing report.",

This dataset is a collection of data sources from the 2017-18 Budget, including:\r\n\r\n* PBS Excel spreadsheets (including Table 2.X.1 Budgeted Expenses for OutcomeX in machine readable format) – available after PBSs are tabled in the Senate (~8.30pm Budget night); and\r\n* Selected tables from Budget Paper No. 4 (including in machine readable format) – available after the BPs are published on budget.gov.au (~7.30 pm Budget night). \r\n\r\nData from the 2017-18 Budget is provided to assist those who wish to analyse and visualise key elements of the 2017-18 Budget.\r\n\r\nData users should refer to footnotes and memoranda in the original files as these are not usually captured in machine readable CSVs.\r\n\r\nWe welcome your feedback and comments below.\r\n\r\nThis dataset was prepared by the Department of Finance.\r\n\r\n##Information about the PBS Excel files and CSV\r\n\r\nThe PBS Excel files published should include the following financial tables with headings and footnotes, which are also are available in CSV. Much of the other data is also available in Budget Papers Nos. 1 and 4 in aggregate form:\r\n\r\n* Table 1.1: Entity Resource Statement;\r\n* Table 1.2: Entity 2017-18 Budget Measures;\r\n* Table 2.X.1: Budgeted Expenses for OutcomeX;\r\n* Table 2.X.2: Program Component Expenses;\r\n* Table 3.1.1 to 3.6: Departmental Budgeted Financial Statements; and\r\n* Tables 3.7 to 3.11: Administered Budgeted Financial Statements.\r\n\r\nPlease note, total expenses reported in the CSV file ‘2017-18 PBS line items dataset’ were prepared from individual entity program expense tables.

    "description": "Early in 1949, an extensive gravity survey was carried out between Sale and Orbost by R.H. Ray Co., U.S.A. for Lakes Oil Ltd. (Ray, 1949). The results of this survey were assessed by Professors Hills (1950) and Rudd (1950), Geological Consultants to Lakes Oil Ltd. As a result of their recommendations, supported by the Victorian Geological Survey, the Bureau of Mineral Resources was requested to carry out further geophysical work in the area. The work carried out by the Bureau includes gravity, seismic, and aeromagnetic surveys. In this record it is proposed to discuss the interpretation of the gravity results. As the Bureau's gravity work is complementary to the Ray Co. survey, the results of both surveys have been combined. The gravity work carried out by the Bureau was intended to provide more detail in some areas not fully covered by the Ray Co. survey, and to extend the margins of the survey on to the basement at the north, and along the coast on the south-east side. Most of the Bureau's work was in areas of difficult access, in swampy or sandy country. The following areas were covered. (1)The coastal area, between Lake Reeve and the sea. (2) Along the shore of Lake Wellington and adjacent areas. (3) To the south-west of Lake Wellington, to define the end of the Baragwanath anticline more closely. (4) In several areas west of Bairnsdale and north of Holland's Landing, to provide more detail on anomalies revealed by the Ray Co. survey. (5) To provide more detail on an anomaly near Giffard in the south-western part of the area. (6) Along several traverses northwards into the highlands.",

The habitat types depicted in the dataset include rocky reef, sand, hard sand and seagrass. The data was collected from November 2004 to September 2005 by marine researchers at the Tasmanian Aquaculture and Fisheries Institute. The shallow waters of the estuaries enabled the use of aerial photography, including purpose flown aerial surveys, and satellite imagery as the primary data source. The habitats defined in the imagery were ground truthed in the field with underwater camera equipment, echo sounder data, and a Differential GPS unit. The dataset is intended for the use of fulfilling the coastal management objectives according to The Living Marine Resources Act 1995 and to support Natural Resource management priorities in the Southern NRM region of Tasmania.",

    "description": "This data was collected in April 2011 by the IMOS Ship of Opportunity Underway CO2 Measurement research group on RV Southern Surveyor (IMOS platform code: VLHJ) voyage SS2011_V01.\r\n\r\nDeparted: \tHobart, TAS, Apr 16, 2011\r\nArrived:   \tHobart, TAS, Apr 21, 2011\r\n\r\nCO2 System Overview:\r\nThe fugacity of carbon dioxide (fCO2) in surface seawater was measured using a General Oceanics Inc. automated system (Model 8050; Pierrot et al 2009). Seawater is sprayed into an equilibration chamber and CO2 in the headspace gas equilibrates with the seawater. The headspace gas is pumped through a thermoelectric condenser followed by a nafion drying tube before flowing through a Licor 7000 non-dispersive infrared gas analyser used to measure the CO2 mole fraction (XCO2) of the dried air. The gas flow is stopped temporarily for the CO2 measurements, which are made at atmospheric pressure. A set of four CO2 standards that cover the range of CO2 values expected in the ocean are analysed about every four hours to calibrate the gas analyser. The standard gas concentrations are on the WMO-X2007 mole fraction scale for CO2-in-air. Atmospheric XCO2 (dry) is measured after the standards by pumping clean outside air from an intake on the forward mast of the ship. \r\n\r\nSeawater intake and ancillary data:\r\nThe seawater intake is located at about 5.5m depth in the bow of the ship. Sea surface salinity is measured using a thermosalinograph (Seabird Electronics SBE21) located next to the CO2 system. A remote temperature sensor (Seabird Electronics SBE 38) located at the intake is used to measure sea surface temperature (SST). The travel time between the intake and CO2 system is typically about 4 minutes with warming usually less than 0.6ºC. The thermosalinograph water is from the same intake, but the supply lines separate after the intake. A comparison of thermosalinograph and equilibrator temperature records shows the temperature difference in the two lines is generally less than 0.1ºC. The thermosalinograph water line travels outside the ship and is typically warmer than the equilibrator. The travel time in water line to the thermosalinograph is 2.5 minutes faster than to the equilibrator. \r\n\r\nMeteorological data, salinity, SST, and ships position and time are taken from the ships logging system. These parameters and the data quality are maintained by the Australian Marine National Facility.",

    "title": "GBR - Dating and mapping historical changes in Great Barrier Reef coral communities, 2007 - 2010 (MTSRF 1.1.4, UQ)",
    "description": "Trajectories of decline have been observed in coral reefs throughout the Caribbean and Indo-Pacific region attributable to the synergistic effects of human-induced disturbances. Whilst direct and indirect evidence suggests that inshore reefs from the Great Barrier Reef (GBR) are showing signs of regional decline following European settlement in the mid 18th century, it has proven difficult to ascertain the link between anthropogenic disturbance and coral degradation on a regional scale. This is primarily due to the absence of detailed ecological baselines on the past condition of many of these reefs prior to the advent of long-term monitoring in the mid 1980¿s.\n\nAn understanding of the timing, frequency, duration and cause of mortality events in hard coral communities is necessary to help direct management efforts towards ameliorating potential impacts. Furthermore, assessing the spatial and temporal variability of changes in community structure before and after European settlement, will provide an invaluable management tool to overcome the ¿shifting baseline¿ syndrome.\n\nBy dating and mapping historical changes in coral communities of inshore reefs of the GBR, the purpose of this study is to provide a detailed baseline assessment on coral community structure and an accurate chronology on the history and nature of mortality events.\n\nDead coral skeletons have been dated using the highly-precise (2? ± up to 1 year) thermal ionisation mass spectrometry (TIMS) uranium-series (U-series) dating method in order to determine 1) the timing of historical mortality in coral communities and massive Porites corals in the Palm Islands region (central Inshore GBR) and reefs adjacent to catchments in the southern GBR (Mackay region) and far northern GBR, 2) historical patterns of storm occurrence on the offshore GBR (One Tree and Heron Reefs), and 3) Holocene sea level changes from the inshore GBR (Magnetic Island).\n\nSo far, more than 320 samples have been dated at the Radiogenic Isotope Facility, University of Queensland. Our results have revealed shifts in coral community structure and a loss of previously dominant Acropora corals in the early 20th century in the Palm Islands region. It is theorized that this loss may be attributable to the synergistic impacts of declining water quality and climatic related factors. Analysis of uplifted reef blocks from the offshore GBR reveals a period of high storm activity throughout the 19th & 20th centuries. Furthermore, U-series dating of fossil massive corals from Magnetic Island suggests that sea level was higher than present around 2200 to 7000 years ago during the Holocene.\n\nOverall, our results show that U-series dating and palaeoecological approaches can provide unique insight into the GBR¿s past.\n\n\nData Units: U-series age (AD) ± 2-sigma error\n\n\nReferences:\n\n- Yu K.

    "title": "The Coronation Hill uranium prospect Katherine - Darwin area, Northern Territory",
    "description": "The uranium prospect at Coronation Hill is situated on the south side of the valley of the South Alligator River, 75 miles from the town of Pine Creek, from which it is accessible by trucks in the dry season. The surface showings consist of discontinuous exposures of autunite over an area approximately 400 feet square upon the north-eastern corner of Coronation Hill, an isolated feature within the river-valley. The rocks present are of Proterozoic age. Mineralization is found within two deeply-weathered members of a sedimentary-volcanic complex which forms the basal member of the Upper Proterozoic: the rocks of the prospect may be in part of Lower Proterozoic age. Sulphide mineralization accompanied by a secondary uranium mineral has been found at one point by diamond drilling: the sulphides are principally pyrite and the nickel sulphide bravoite. Mineralization is associated with a partly crushed and highly altered zone adjacent to a mass of Upper Proterozoic sandstone which overlaps the older and lower rocks. The structure is imperfectly understood and the control over mineralization has not been established. Development work, including costeaning, pitting, diamond drilling (1006 feet in two holes) and geophysical surveys (Radiometric, magnetic and electrical) has found no mineralization of economic grade, although it has shown the presence of alteration and sulphide mineralization which indicate that the full potentialities of the prospect have not yet been determined. Further work sufficient to complete preliminary exploration would require a minimum of 2500 feet of diamond drilling on underground operations at least equivalent to 1000 feet of drifting and crosscutting. Diamond drilling is somewhat preferable, since it can reach more deeply below the weathered zone. Only after completion of this additional work can it be determined whether or not the prospect is of economic value.",

It has not been designated an SA4 group, so is only included in the NSW total.\n\n\nSchools for specific purposes (SSPs) are for students with specific needs. \n\n\nEnvironmental Education Centres (EECs) provide environmental education for students, but do not have full time enrolments. \n\n\nSince 2014, the department has used a geographical structure based on the new ABS Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS). Groups of ASGS Statistical Area 4 (SA4) boundaries in NSW have been combined into 11 groups for reporting and publication of department data.

    "title": "Salamander Diversity and Distributions Data, Central Appalachian Region, West Virginia, USA",
    "description": "The Central Appalachian region, USA, contains several high elevation-endemic woodland salamanders (genus Plethodon), which are thought to be particularly vulnerable to climate change due to their restricted distributions and low vagility. In West Virginia, there is a strong management focus on protection and recovery of the federally threatened Cheat Mountain salamander (Plethodon nettingi; CMS). To support this focus, there is a need for improved understanding of CMS occurrence-habitat relationships and spatially explicit projections of fine-scale contemporary and potential future habitat quality to inform management actions. In addition, there is concern among resource managers that climate change may increase habitat quality at high elevations for CMS competitors, particularly the eastern red-backed salamander (Plethodon cinereus; RBS), potentially resulting in increased competition pressure for CMS. To address these knowledge gaps, we created ecological niche models for CMS and RBS using the Random Forest classification algorithm and used the estimated occurrence-habitat relationships to assess ecological niche overlap between the species and project fine-scale contemporary and potential future habitat availability and quality. We estimated that the ecological niches of CMS and RBS were 80.5% similar, and habitat projections indicated the species would exhibit opposite responses to climate change in our region. For CMS, we estimated that amount of high-quality habitat will be reduced by mid-century and potentially lost by end-of-century, but that moderate and low-quality habitat will persist. For RBS, we estimated that amount of high-quality habitat will increase through end-of-century, and that high elevations will become more suitable for the species, indicating that competition pressure for CMS is likely to increase. This study improves understanding of important habitat characteristics for CMS and RBS, and our spatially explicit projections can assist natural resource managers with habitat protection actions, species monitoring efforts, and climate change adaptation strategies.",

    "description": "Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are millisecond-duration radio bursts of extragalactic origin. Since the discovery of the first FRB in the archival Parkes/Murriyang multibeam data, a broad dichotomy in population has emerged. Some FRBs have been seen to be repeating, while others are not, despite a significant amount of follow-up using different radio telescopes. The repeating FRB 20240114A was recently discovered by CHIME/FRB, which has been seen to have an exceptionally high burst activity. Such extreme burst activity has not been seen in any other source. The repeating FRBs, such as FRB 20240114A, provide an unparalleled window into their circumburst environment due to their repeating nature, which can be used to constrain possible progenitor models and test underlying emission mechanisms. The previous Parkes/Murriyang source follow-up has also revealed intriguing spectro-polarimetric properties, such as frequency-dependent evolution of burst central frequency or chromaticity, a possible activity window, significantly large circular polarisation (CP), and frequency-dependent CP. These properties hold the key towards understanding the circumburst environment of the FRBs, and test possible progenitor models. A large bandwidth instrument with reliable polarimetry has been critical in uncovering these properties. The ultra-wideband low (UWL) receiver on Parkes/Murriyang is ideally suited to explore the source's wideband spectro-temporal and polarimetric behaviour. We propose a campaign to regularly follow up FRB 20240114A to ascertain its long-term evolution of spectro-temporal properties.",

    "description": "Primary producers play significant roles in coastal processes and ecological function. These roles include provision of habitat, stabilising substrates and provision of a food source to fauna. Currently, there are very few studies on primary producers in the Kimberley region, contributing to the poor understanding of processes and adaptive mechanisms under extreme environmental conditions. The project has focussed on the data deficient components of benthic primary producers: seagrasses, macroalgae and sediment microalgae and bacterial communities. The objectives of the project were to (a) understand the temporal and spatial variations in biomass and productivity of seagrasses, macroalgae and benthic microalgae (b) investigate the rates and magnitude of microbial carbon and nitrogen cycling processes, and how they influence primary production and (c) to investigate the rates and net effect of herbivory on seagrasses, macroalgae and benthic microalgae.\nThe seasonal and spatial variability in biomass and growth of selected species of seagrasses and seaweeds was measured during 5 surveys at 5 sites in the Bardi Jawi Indigenous Protected Area (on dates during 2013-2015). The productivity, carbon processes and nutrient cycling of microalgae and bacteria in intertidal and shallow subtidal sediment was also measured. Rates of herbivory were measured at 3 sites during 4 surveys. Stable isotope ratios of the major primary producers were measured at 5 sites.",

Central to these measures was the establishment of a system of dugong protection areas in these regions. The Areas are declared in legislation under the Fisheries Act 1994 and the Queensland Nature Conservation Act 1992. Two types of protection areas were established : Zone A has more stringent controls over netting practices. Foreshore set nets and offshore set and drift nets are prohibited in most Zone A protection areas. In Zone B mesh netting is permitted but with restrictions on the type, size and location of nets, and requirements for attendance at nets. Current March 2002.",

    "description": "This dataset presents the footprint of the percentage of all women who gave birth and had at least one antenatal visit in the first trimester. The data spans every two years between 2012-2016 and is aggregated to Statistical Area Level 3 (SA3) geographic areas from the 2011 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nThe Child and Maternal Health Indicators have been calculated from the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare (AIHW) National Mortality Database and Register of Births and National Perinatal Data Collection. This measure has been calculated with the numerator as the total number of women who gave birth and had at least one antenatal visit in the first trimester, and the denominator as the total number of mothers with a recorded week of gestation at the first antenatal visit.\nFor further information about this dataset, visit the data source:Australian Institute of Health and Welfare - Child and Maternal Health Data Tables.\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data.\n\n\nAn antenatal visit is a planned visit between a pregnant woman and a midwife or doctor to assess and improve the wellbeing of the mother and baby throughout pregnancy. An antenatal visit does not include a visit where the sole purpose of contact is to confirm the pregnancy, or those contacts that occurred during the pregnancy that related to other non-pregnancy related issues. An antenatal visit in the first trimester is defined as occurring before 14 weeks' gestational age.\n\n\nData at the area level exclude births to Australian non-residents and women who could not be allocated because their usual residence was not stated or was not valid\n\n\nIn WA and ACT, first antenatal visits that occur outside of the hospital may not be included, so these data should be interpreted with caution\n\n\nPercentage for an area are suppressed for publication and marked as 'NP' if the number of mothers with a recorded week of gestation at the first antenatal visit for the area is less than 100\n\n",

This project will employ acoustic monitoring technology in a series of inshore and offshore environments including coastal bays, inshore reefs and offshore reefs to monitor the presence and movements of predator species (elasmobranchs and teleosts). Mobile predators will be fitted with acoustic transmitters to define their presence and distribution, extent of movement and amount of connectivity between study locations (i.e., movement from bay to inshore reef, movement among reef platforms, etc.).  Predator presence and movement will be integrated with habitat mapping and environmental monitoring data to identify factors that lead to changes in movement patterns and to define any preferred locations or conditions that can be targeted for conservation or management.  Examination of use of habitats will provide information about the amount of time spent in various GBRMP zones and amount of movement among zones to assess the amount of protection provided under current management arrangements.",

The criteria for the EPBC community is slightly different to the ACT listed of the community Yellow box-Blakely's red gum grassy woodland and derived grassland community. \nMapping represents 'potential' distribution of the threatened ecological community (tec) as listing status of this community must be verified with field inspection.\nMapping product supersedes mapping completed by Maguire and Mulvaney in 2012 (see <a href=\"https://www.act.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0007/2539609/25-box-gum-woodland-in-the-act-2011.pdf\">https://www.act.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0007/2539609/25-box-gum-woodland-in-the-act-2011.pdf</a>).\nCaveat: This layer is indicative of likely habitat for threatened grassy box woodlands in the ACT but may not reflect the full distribution.

    "description": "KSN Project 2.2.2 provides key information on the oceanographic and biological forcing associated with nutrient supply that determines the near-shore productivity of the Kimberley region, and links these with higher trophic levels. Key objectives of the research were\n- To make new estimates of pelagic primary productivity, identifying the key physical and community processes driving production in the region.\n- To better describe the phytoplankton and zooplankton communities in coastal waters of the Kimberley, to determine the trophic linkages within these communities and to identify the key factors controlling pelagic secondary productivity.\n- To integrate these parameters into an extensible biogeochemical modelling framework, allowing predictive linkages between physical and biological processes in the region.\nThis metadata records specifically relates to modelling aspects of the project completed by CSIRO. The data originates from a number of model simulations conducted between 3/1/2010 to 21/12/2010. All field data are held at Pawsey and RV Southern Surveyor and RV Solander.",

This data is input to water models of varying types, purposes, and complexity. The water models transform this input data to produce a range of water related modelled data.\n\nThe stochastic climate data and palaeo stochastic climate data include 10,000 replicates of 130-yr daily data sets of rainfall and potential evapotranspiration generated using observed data sets without and with combined palaeo climate data. This work has been undertaken by researchers at the University of Newcastle and used in modelling for Greater Sydney Water Strategy.\n\nStochastic Climate data and palaeo stochastic climate data are available to download for Greater Sydney region from the Related Datasets section below.\n\n\n\nNote: If you would like to ask a question, make any suggestions, or tell us how you are using this dataset, please visit the <a href=\"https://water-hub.seed.nsw.gov.au/thread/search\">NSW Water Hub which has an online forum</a> you can join.",

    "description": "This dataset presents the footprint of the percentage of babies born at or after 40 weeks gestation who weighed less than 2,750 grams at birth. This has been calculated with the number of babies born at or after 40 weeks gestation who weighed less than 2,750 grams at birth, divided by the number of babies born at or after 40 weeks gestation, and multiplied by 100. The data spans the years of 2014-2016 and is aggregated to Statistical Area Level 3 (SA3) geographic areas from the 2011 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nThe data is sourced from the National Perinatal Data Collection (NPDC), which is a national population-based cross-sectional collection of data on pregnancy and childbirth. The data are based on births reported to the perinatal data collection in each state and territory in Australia. Midwives and other birth attendants, using information obtained from mothers and from hospital or other records, complete notification forms for each birth. A standard de-identified extract is provided to the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare (AIHW) on an annual basis to form the NPDC.\nFor further information about this dataset, please visit:\n\n\nAustralian Institute of Health and Welfare - National Core Maternity Indicators Data Tables.\n\n\nMetadata Online Registry Entry.\n\n\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data.\n\n\nA birth is defined as an event in which a baby comes out of the uterus after a pregnancy of at least 20 weeks gestation or weighing 400 grams or more.\n\n\nBirths included are those for babies born at or after 40 weeks gestation. This includes stillborn babies and babies from a multiple birth.\n\n\nBirths excluded are those for babies born before 40 completed weeks gestational age, that is before 40 weeks and 0 (zero) days.\n\n\nGestational age is reported as completed weeks.\n\n\nCaution should be used when comparing these results with other nationally and internationally reported indicators, as the cut-off birthweight may be different to this indicator.\n\n\nData for Statistical Local Area Level 3 (SA3) of mother's usual residence reported using a 3-year aggregate, 2014-2016.\n\n\nThe sum of the reported 'Grouped by' values may not equal the Australia total.\n\n",

    "description": "Summary of marine environmental monitoring and observation effort by networks associated with three Australian National Research Infrastructures from 2010 to the present organised by State/Territory, IMCRA bioregion, feature type and year.\nMetadata records were aggregated from biodiversity survey events from the Atlas of Living Australia (ALA, https://ala.org.au/), marine observations collected by the Integrated Marine Observing System (IMOS, https://imos.org.au/) and site-based monitoring and survey efforts by the Terrestrial Ecosystem Research Network (TERN, https://tern.org.au/). See Aggregated Data: Environmental Monitoring and Observations Effort for information on the metadata included.\nThe elements in this dataset are as follows:\n1.  Year in which activity occurred (2010 to present)\n2.  State/Territory\n3.  IMCRA4.0 mesoscale marine bioregion\n4.  Feature ID from EcoAssets Earth Science Features vocabulary\n5.  Feature name associated with feature ID\n6.  Feature facet 1 – high-level facet based on feature ID – a top-level GCMD Earth Science category (6 terms)\n7.  Feature facet 2 – intermediate-level facet based on feature ID – second-level GCMD/ANSL category (29 terms)\n8.  Feature facet 3 – lower-level facet with more fine-grained taxonomic structure based on feature ID – typically a third-level GCMD/ANSL category (36 terms)\n9.

    "description": "This data was collected in April 2012 by the IMOS Ship of Opportunity Underway CO2 Measurement research group on RV Southern Surveyor (IMOS platform code: VLHJ) voyage SS2012_T01.\n\nDeparted: \tHobart, TAS, Apr 11, 2012\nArrived:   \tBrisbane, QLD, Apr 18, 2012\n\nCO2 System Overview:\nThe fugacity of carbon dioxide (fCO2) in surface seawater was measured using a General Oceanics Inc. automated system (Model 8050; Pierrot et al 2009). Seawater is sprayed into an equilibration chamber and CO2 in the headspace gas equilibrates with the seawater. The headspace gas is pumped through a thermoelectric condenser followed by a nafion drying tube before flowing through a Licor 7000 non-dispersive infrared gas analyser used to measure the CO2 mole fraction (XCO2) of the dried air. The gas flow is stopped temporarily for the CO2 measurements, which are made at atmospheric pressure. A set of four CO2 standards that cover the range of CO2 values expected in the ocean are analysed about every four hours to calibrate the gas analyser. The standard gas concentrations are on the WMO-X2007 mole fraction scale for CO2-in-air. Atmospheric XCO2 (dry) is measured after the standards by pumping clean outside air from an intake on the forward mast of the ship. \n\nSeawater intake and ancillary data:\nThe seawater intake is located at about 5.5m depth in the bow of the ship. Sea surface salinity is measured using a thermosalinograph (Seabird Electronics SBE21) located next to the CO2 system. A remote temperature sensor (Seabird Electronics SBE 38) located at the intake is used to measure sea surface temperature (SST). The travel time between the intake and CO2 system is typically about 4 minutes with warming usually less than 0.6ºC. The thermosalinograph water is from the same intake, but the supply lines separate after the intake. A comparison of thermosalinograph and equilibrator temperature records shows the temperature difference in the two lines is generally less than 0.1ºC. The thermosalinograph water line travels outside the ship and is typically warmer than the equilibrator. The travel time in water line to the thermosalinograph is 2.5 minutes faster than to the equilibrator. \n\nMeteorological data, salinity, SST, and ships position and time are taken from the ships logging system. These parameters and the data quality are maintained by the Australian Marine National Facility.",

    "description": "This study used histological methods to describe the reproductive cycle of Lepsiella vinosa. L.vinosa was collected from the West Head rocky shore on 12 occasions between April 1975 and March 1976. Individual shell lengths were measured and the soft tissue of the animals removed to determine the sex. Four to six animals of each sex were used for histological examination by excising a 5 mm section of the visceral coil from each animal. Ovarian sections at 100 micron intervals were examined under a compound binocular microscope and the numbers of immature and mature oocytes were counted. The area of the testis in the visceral coil was used as an estimate of the maturity of males.\n\nThere were 177 males and 169 females collected and the females (average 0.86 ± 0.09 cm) were generally larger than males (average 0.82 ± 0.09 cm). The sex ratio was female bias throughout the year. There were significantly more immature oocytes present in the ovary throughout the year with a peak in May and June. The testis occupied a proportionally larger cross-sectional area of the visceral coil in summer and early autumn and then decreased in size to a minimum in August. This testis size correlated with observations of copulating pairs of L.vinosa during autumn and winter at West Head.",

    "description": "This dataset is the 2016 release of the Victoria in Future series of data and presents Estimated Residential Population (ERP) data by 5-year age groups and sex for the state of Victoria. The data is presented in 2011 Local Government Area (LGA) boundaries and covers each fifth year for the years 2011 to 2031.\nThe Victoria in Future series is a projection of the ERP for LGAs and Victoria in Future Small Areas (VIFSA) for 2011 to 2031. Some data areas are available for individual years and some for every fifth year in the projection period. The first year for each dataset within the series is 2011. Where available, the latest Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) data is used for the years 2012 to 2015.\nData are available for Estimated Resident Population (ERP - the official total population), population by age and sex (for single years of age in some cases, otherwise for five-year age groups), households and dwellings (including average household sizes and dwelling occupancy rates).\nVictoria in Future 2016 population projections are not predictions of the future, nor are they targets. They analyse changing economic and social structures and other drivers of demographic trends to indicate possible future populations if the present identified demographic and social trends continue. Projections are based exclusively on demographic components at the state and regional level, while local level projections take account of current and future land use, dwelling capacity, and development opportunities in addition to local demographic factors.\nFor more information please visit the DELWP VIF Portal.\nNotes: \n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data.\n\n\nThese detailed projections replace the projections published in Victoria in Future 2015 (based on the 2011 Census) issued by the Department of Transport, Planning and Local Infrastructure (DTPLI).\n\n\nThe base year for the calculation of VIF2016 projections is 2015 (as at 30 June), the most recent year for which the ABS has published the Estimated Resident Population (ERP) for both Victoria and for LGAs.\n\n\nThe data tables have been condensed to one dataset to allow longitudinal analysis of the data through year-period filters.\n\n",

    "title": "Geoscience Australia, 1 second SRTM Digital Elevation Model (DEM)",
    "description": "## **Abstract** \n\nThis dataset and its metadata statement were supplied to the Bioregional Assessment Programme by a third party and are presented here as originally supplied.\n\nThis dataset provides a userguide and setup information relating to accessing the Gescience Australia, 1 second SRTM Digital Elevation Model (DEM), for visualisation and analysis using ESRI ArcMap and ArcCatalog.\n\n\n\nThe 1 second DSM, DEM, DEM-S and DEM-H are national elevation data products derived from the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) data. The SRTM data is not suitable for routine application due to various artefacts and noise.\n\nThe data has been treated with several processes to produce more usable products:\n\n\\* A cleaned digital surface model (DSM)\n\n\\* regular grid representing ground surface topography as well as other features including vegetation and man-made structures\n\n\\* A bare-earth digital elevation model (DEM)\n\n\\* regular grid representing ground surface topography, and where possible, excluding other features such as vegetation and man-made structures.\n\n\\* A smoothed digital elevation model (DEM-S)\n\n\\* A smoothed DEM based on the bare-earth DEM that has been adaptively smoothed to reduce random noise typically associated with the SRTM data in low relief areas.\n\n\\* A hydrologically enforced digital elevation model (DEM-H)\n\n\\* A hydrologically enforced DEM is based on DEM-S that has had drainage lines imposed and been further smoothed using the ANUDEM interpolation software.\n\n\n\nThe last product, a hydrologically enforced DEM, is most similar to the DEMs commonly in use around Australia, such as the GEODATA 9 Second DEM and the 25 m resolution DEMs produced by State and Territory agencies from digitised topographic maps.\n\nFor any analysis where surface shape is important, one of the smoothed DEMs (DEM-S or DEM-H) should be used. DEM-S is preferred for shape and vertical accuracy and DEM-H for hydrological connectivity. The DSM is suitable if you want to see the vegetation as well as the land surface height. There are few cases where DEM is the best data source, unless access to a less processed product is necessary.\n\nThe 1 second DEM (in its various incarnations) has quite different characteristics to DEMs derived by interpolation from topographic data. Those DEMs are typically quite smooth and are based on fairly accurate but sparse source data, usually contours and spot heights supplemented by drainage lines. The SRTM data is derived from radar measurements that are dense (there is essentially a measurement at almost every grid cell) but noisy.\n\nVersion 1.0 of the DSM was released in early 2009 and version 1.0 of the DEM was released in late 2009. Version 1.0 of the DEM-S was released in July 2010 and version 1.0 of the hydrologically enforced DEM-H was released in October 2011. These products provide substantial improvements in the quality and consistency of the data relative to the original SRTM data, but are not free from artefacts. Improved products will be released over time.\n\nThe 3 second products were derived from the 1 second data and version 1.0 was released in August 2010. Future releases of these products will occur when the 1 second products have been improved. At this stage there is no 3 second DEM-H product, which requires re-interpolation with drainage enforcement at that resolution.\n\n## **Dataset History** \n\nThe following datasets were used to derive this version of the 1 second DEM products:\n\n\n\nSource data\n\n1. SRTM 1 second Version 2 data (Slater et al., 2006), supplied by Defence Imagery and Geospatial Organisation (DIGO) as 813 1 x 1 degree tiles. Data were produced by NASA from radar data collected by the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission in February 2000.\n\n2. GEODATA 9 second DEM Version 3 (Geoscience Australia, 2008) used to fill voids.\n\n3. SRTM Water Body Data (SWBD) shapefile accompanying the SRTM data (Slater et al., 2006). This defines the coastline and larger inland waterbodies for the DEM and DSM.\n\n4. Vegetation masks and water masks applied to the DEM to remove vegetation.\n\n\n\nFull metadata, methodologies and lineage descriptions can be found in the PDF userguide within this dataset.\n\n\n\nFurther information can be found at http://www.ga.gov.au/metadata-gateway/metadata/record/gcat_72759\n\n## **Dataset Citation** \n\nGeoscience Australia (2011) Geoscience Australia, 1 second SRTM Digital Elevation Model (DEM).

    "description": "This dataset presents the footprint of School Disciplinary Absences for Queensland state schools by year and absence type. The data is aggregated to the Department of Education, Training and Employment (DETE) regions and spans the years of 2007-2011.\nState schools are required to report School Disciplinary Absences (SDA) for the school year in their School Annual Report. There are 4 categories of SDA: short suspension (1-5 days), long suspension (6-20 days), suspensions with proposal/recommendation for exclusion and cancellations of enrolment. A student may be suspended or excluded from a state school or schools because of disobedience, misconduct or other conduct that is prejudicial to the good order and management of the school. A student may also be excluded from a state school for contravention of a Behaviour Improvement Condition. Suspension prohibits a student from attending an educational institution for a nominated period of time (from 1-5 days or 6-20 days). Decisions to suspend a student are made by individual state school principals.\nFor further information about this dataset, please visit the Queensland Department of Education - School Disciplinary Absences.\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled this data using the Departmental Geographic Regions.\n\n\nData is made available through a AURIN-QCIF-RIDL collaboration.\n\n\nOn 5 November 2010, state school principals were given the power to exclude students from their school. They may recommend the decision to their supervisor if they believe it is inappropriate for them to make the decision.\n\n\nThe information is displayed in terms of aggregate counts of incidents. These data do not represent the outcomes of any related appeal decisions.\n\n\nThe enrolment figures are counts of full-time students which are sourced from the annual August Student Census.\n\n\nSchool Disciplinary Absence incident counts from 2006 to Semester 1, 2009 were verified by principals when the School Disciplinary Absence Collection system (SDAC) was decommissioned in June 2009. Since Semester 2, 2009 the data source for SDA data has been from OneSchool. This data is validated by the department with school principals at time of collection.\n\n",

It is not energy consumption data captured by a meter, but modelled data based on building attributes such as building age, floor area etc. This data was provided by the CSIRO as a result of a study commissioned by IMAP Councils. The study was governed by a Grant Agreement between Councils and the CSIRO, which stated an intent for the data to be published. This specific dataset is presented at a block level scale. It includes both commercial and residential buildings and is a 2016 business-as-usual projection, relative to a 2011 baseline. It does not include the industrial sector.",

    "description": "A predictive model has been established and tested to account for variations in the landscape to reflect changes in agricultural land capability class (on a progressive rating of 1: good - 7: poor). This dataset (and map) provides a prediction of the most likely land capability class to be expected in a particular location based on several layers of readily available information. These layers included geology, rainfall, slope, elevation, forest cover and surface drainage status. These data layers were input into a Geographic Information System modelling framework. Using previous experience and limited visits in the field, the output has been produced as a digital dataset and 1: 100,000 map. It was found to provide a relatively good impression of the landscapes potential for agricultural persuits (ie cropping and grazing). It was found to represent changes in capability class very well where geology, climate or slope control capability. In those areas where subsurface drainage controlled land capability it was found to be less reliable. Overall however as these areas of the State were previously devoid of any broadscale land resource information for this purpose - this map provides a valuable fist step in discerning land capability.",

    "title": "SLK Points for Road Network",
    "description": "SLKs or Straight Line Kilometers are a location reference system used by Main Roads Western Australia to define the location of features or events along a road. This layer shows SLK points (every 100m) along the left and single carriageways for all State and Local Roads, Main Roads controlled paths contained within the road centreline of Main Roads road asset database. The purpose of this layer is to identify and label the measure of SLK along a particular route and is provided for information only. The SLK points are based on geometric measure and include points of equation. This means that you may notice “jumps” in the SLK between two points that are not equal to 100m. This is as a result of network changes that have been incorporated into the spatial road centr eline.A point of equation is a business term used to describe a point on the road network, which has two SLK references, one for the section leading up to it, and one for the section leaving from it. A Point of Equation is either: •A gap, which occurs when the new deviation/realignment is built shorter than the existing road. An SLK range is missing. •An overlap, which occurs when the new deviation/realignment is built longer than the existing road. An SLK range is duplicatedNote that you are accessing this data pursuant to a Creative Commons (Attribution) Licence, which has a disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability.

Potential years of life lost represents the sum of the actual age at death and 75 years of age.\nThe data is by Primary Health Network (PHN) 2017 geographic boundaries based on the 2016 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nThere are 31 PHNs set up by the Australian Government. Each network is controlled by a board of medical professionals and advised by a clinical council and community advisory committee. The boundaries of the PHNs closely align with the Local Hospital Networks where possible.\nFor more information please see the data source notes on the data. \nSource: Data compiled by PHIDU from deaths data based on the 2014 to 2018 Cause of Death Unit Record Files supplied by the Australian Coordinating Registry and the Victorian Department of Justice, on behalf of the Registries of Births, Deaths and Marriages and the National Coronial Information System. The population is the ABS Estimated Resident Population (ERP) for Australia, 30 June 2014 to 30 June 2018.\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data. Data that was not shown/not applicable/not published/not available for the specific area ('#', '..', '^', 'np, 'n.a.', 'n.y.a.' in original PHIDU data) was removed.It has been replaced by by Blank cells.
