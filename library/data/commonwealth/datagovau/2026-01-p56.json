    "description": "Interim Biogeographic Regionalisation for Australia (IBRA) version 7.0 represents a landscape based approach to classifying the land surface of Australia. 89 biogeographic regions and 419 sub regions have been delineated, each reflecting a unifying set of major environmental influences which shape the occurrence of flora and fauna and their interaction with the physical environment across Australia and its external territories (excluding Antarctica). IBRA Version 7.0 data consists of two datasets. IBRA bioregions, which is a larger scale regional classification of homogenous ecosystems, and sub regions, which are more localised. IBRA Version 7.0 is the result of both significant changes to certain IBRA 6.1 boundaries, plus refinement of other boundaries due to better data availability amongst some states and territories, and alterations by the states/territories along state borders. The updated boundaries were jointly defined by the Commonwealth, State and Territory nature and conservation agencies. In this respect refinements were carried out to all mainland jurisdictions with significant changes in Queensland and South Australia. In addition the dataset was also updated to more closely conform to the Geoscience Australia 1:100K State borders, and a standard coding/naming convention introduced (for both regions and sub-regions) resulting in differences to both names and codes used in earlier IBRA Versions.\nVarious sources were used to delineate islands - these included the GA100K Admin layer plus the Australian Maritime Boundaries dataset, a Coral Sea dataset (held in ERIN) and the GA Commonwealth Fisheries 2006 dataset.CC - Attribution (CC BY)\nData to be available in the Public Domain under Creative Commons by Attribution Licensing Agreement. \nMore information can be found here: http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/au/deed.en\nUsers must attribute the Australian Government Department of the Environment and Energy as the data provider.",

    "description": "The Measuring Broadband Australia (MBA) program relies on households across Australia volunteering to receive a Whitebox that tests the performance of their fixed-line broadband services. Thousands of tests are run and these measurements are used to calculate average speeds achieved and other metrics for different volunteer groups, such as volunteers on the NBN fixed-line services and volunteers on NBN fixed wireless services.\r\nThe summary data released includes test results for all Whiteboxes used in MBA Report 14 for download, upload, latency and outages metrics. The results are de-identified to protect the privacy of the volunteers and the integrity of the MBA program.\r\n",

    "description": "This dataset presents counts of payment recipients by payment type for the quarter ending September 2015. The data is based on the recipient's geocoded address aggregated by Statistical Area Level 2 (SA2) from the Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS) 2011.\nThe Department of Social Services (DSS) is the Australian Government's lead agency in the development and delivery of social policy, and is working to improve the lifetime wellbeing of people and families in Australia. DSS' policies and services respond to need across people's lives - looking after families, children and older people; providing a safety net for people who cannot fully support themselves; enhancing the wellbeing of people with high needs; assisting people who need help with care; and supporting a diverse and harmonious society. DSS supports people and families in Australia by encouraging independence and participation, and supporting a cohesive society.\nFor more information on this dataset please visit the Australian Government Open Data.\nFor further details on payments, see 'A guide to Australian Government payments'.\nPlease note:\n\n\nIn order to protect individuals' privacy, identified populations between 1 and 19 have been suppressed and replaced with '&lt;20' for confidentiality purposes. Additional data may be suppressed and replaced with 'n.p.' (not provided) to prevent the derivation of identified populations that have values of less than 20.\n\n\nCaveats specific to payments type can be found in the relevant payment description of the original data.\n\n\nAURIN has spatialised this dataset and have made the following replacements to enforce data type consistency: \n\n\n'&lt;20' has been assigned a value of '-1' within the data\n\n\nA boolean field has been created for each data field to flag left-censored data. 'True' is assigned to fields that have been censored.\n\n\n'n.p.' (not provided) has been set to Null within the data.\n\n",

    "description": "Data of the risk of Potential Acid Sulfate Soil (PASS) materials being disturbed by land development activities based on the likelihood of PASS materials occurring within 3m of the ground surface for the Lower South West Region. This data is designed for use by planners to assess whether development applications for specific sites require additional conditions on the basis of whether normal land development activities carry a risk of disturbing PASS materials. Disturbance risk is rated on the basis of the likelihood of PASS materials being encountered within 3m of the ground surface should this depth of soil be disturbed in any way. The depth of 3m is considered since this was regarded as the depth that most soil disturbance activities would extend during in most land development processes. Disturbance activities in this context include drainage, excavations and dewatering. For further information phone the Contaminated Sites hotline 1300 762 982.\n\nThis dataset was formerly known as Acid Sulfate Soil Risk Map, Lower South West (DER-010).\nThis dataset is no longer actively maintained by DWER.",

    "description": "<strong>The Georgetown, Queensland, 2024 Airborne Electromagnetic Survey </strong>was conducted by Geoscience Australia in collaboration with the Geological Survey of Queensland. The survey aimed to enhance geological understanding and support mineral exploration and groundwater research in the region.\n\nThe primary goal was to acquire detailed electromagnetic and magnetic geophysical data to improve understanding of subsurface geological formations, which could aid in mineral exploration and groundwater studies. This survey will be included in the national AusAEM airborne electromagnetic acquisition program, which aims to provide geophysical information to support investigations of regional geology and groundwater systems. This data will help to better characterise architecture of aquifers within the upper 200-300 hundred meters of the subsurface. It will also provide insights to trends in regolith thickness and variability, variations in bedrock conductivity, the conductivity of key bedrock (lithology-related) conductive units under cover, and the groundwater systems of the region at a reconnaissance scale.\n\nNew Resolution Geophysics Pty. Ltd. (NRG) was commissioned for data acquisition and processing. The survey was carried out between August and November 2024, covering 10,600 flight-line kilometres with a nominal line spacing of 2 kilometres. NRG’s XCITE™ airborne electromagnetic system was used to collect the data. The survey lines were oriented East-West, with a nominal terrain clearance of 40 meters. Subsurface conductivity models were derived using Geoscience Australia’s deterministic, 1D Layered-Earth Inversion (GALEI) code combined with noise estimates determined by NRG.\n\nThe data package also contains the results and derived products from data Geoscience Australia staff inverted using Internally developed sample-by-sample deterministic layered-earth (1D) inversion algorithm GALEISBS.\n\n\n<b>NRG delivered data is available on request from clientservices@ga.gov.au - Quote eCat# 150184</b>",

    "description": "Lizard Island is located in the Northern Great Barrier Reef province, approximately 270km north of Cairns. Reef drilling was undertaken to investigate the Holocene evolution of the fringing reefs of Lizard Island. Radiocarbon dating of the cored coral material was then used to establish the chronology of the reef and to quantify the rate of development. \n\nThree drill cores were extracted, all from the windward margin because the leeward margin was too deep to access and did not form a conventional reef flat margin. The maximum depth reached was 4.5 m in core L1, with cores L2 and L3 being abandoned after encountering thick sand layers. \n\nThe cores were logged and photographed, and thin sections were made and petrographically examined. Corals that were determined to be in situ (by the orientation of their corallites) and free from internal cement and detritus by microscope examination were selected for radiocarbon dating.\n\nRadiocarbon dates indicate that the fringing reef at Lizard Island started growing directly on an assumed granite basement approximately 6.7 cal kyr BP at approximately 4.5 m below the reef flat surface. The windward margin at Lizard Island approached modern day sea level approximately 4 cal kyr BP. Rates of vertical accretion ranged from 0.5 to 0.7 m/kyr at Lizard Island.",

    "description": "Data describes vegetation extent priorities for each stream reach across the Melbourne Water region. Each reach is classified as either high, medium or low priority. To meet the performance objectives of the Healthy Waterways Strategy 2018 (HWS2018), high priority reaches need to be revegetated by 2028. To meet the target trajectory scores of the Healthy Waterways Strategy, medium priority reaches need to be revegetated by 2068. Vegetation priority reaches were determined by a combination of decision support tools and the co-design process. The decision support tool used was Zonation, which prioritised management actions across the region with the objective of improving instream habitat suitability for platypus, fish and macroinvertebrates.\n\n\n\nFor the most up-to-date performance objectives, see the co-designed Catchment Programs at: <a href=\"https://www.melbournewater.com.au/about-us/strategies-achievements-and-policies/healthy-waterways-strategy\">https://www.melbournewater.com.au/about-us/strategies-achievements-and-policies/healthy-waterways-strategy</a> \n\n\n\nResults are considered fit for purpose (i.e. for waterway planning). This data set covers the entire Melbourne Water region with the exception of very small areas close to Port Phillip Bay or Western Port. For example, there are small areas of French Island which are not captured.\n\n\n\nThis data set was created using: 1. Streams dataset for the Healthy Waterways Strategy 2018. This layer was developed by GraceGIS using Melbourne Water layers as inputs.\n\n\n\nFor further reading on the prioritisation process see:\n\n• Chee et al. (in development), Habitat Suitability Models, Scenarios and Quantitative Action Prioritisation (using Zonation) for Melbourne Water’s Healthy Waterways Strategy: A Resource Document, University of Melbourne and Melbourne Water for Melbourne Waterways Research Practice Partnership\n\n• Melbourne Water (in development), Healthy Waterways Strategy Resource Document, Presentation of revegetation priority reaches for the Healthy Waterways Strategy 2018.\n\n\n\nNOTE: Whilst every effort has been taken in collecting, validating and providing the attached data, Melbourne Water Corporation makes no representations or guarantees as to the accuracy or completeness of this data.

    "description": "The data for this map were collected as part of two ASAC projects - 488 and 956, of which Patricia Selkirk was the chief investigator. Macquarie Island (54 degrees S 159 degrees E) is a subantarctic island (c. 35km by 3 to 5km) approximately equidistant between Tasmania, New Zealand and Antarctica in the Southern Ocean. The vegetation is herbaceous, lacking shrubs and trees. Vegetation and drainage are mapped at a scale of 1:25 000 from field observations, satellite imagery and limited oblique and aerial photography. The categories adopted for mapping vegetation are based on attributes of foliage height and percentage foliage cover of the ground surface (vegetation structure), not on species distribution (floristics). The distribution of vegetation categories is strongly correlated with aspect, topography and rock type. Mires, streams and lakes form an intricate drainage pattern that is strongly influenced by the geology of this tectonically active emergent crest of the submarine Macquarie Ridge at the boundary of the Pacific and Australian plates. The drainage pattern of the whole island is represented in a map with substantially greater accuracy than in any previous map.",

    "title": "Heat Vulnerability Index - City of Melbourne (SA1) 2021",
    "description": "Heat Vulnerability Index (HVI) including heat exposure, sensitivity, and adaptive capability indicators were created for City of Melbourne.The dataset supports the development of a national heat vulnerability assessment toolkit for Australia, designed to identify areas and populations most susceptible to heat-related risks. The project addresses the growing need for understanding the relationship between urbanization, land surface temperature (LST), and the urban heat island effect, particularly for vulnerable communities. Integrating satellite-derived environmental data (LST, Normalized Difference Built-up Index (NDBI), Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI)) with socioeconomic data, this toolkit provides a comprehensive resource for building heat-resilient cities and suburbs.\nThis dataset includes both raw environmental data for the 2020-2021 Australian summer (November to March) and a calculated Heat Vulnerability Index (HVI) aggregated to the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) Statistical Area Level 1 (SA1) polygon dataset. The HVI, based on the IPCC's vulnerability conceptual framework, is a composite index comprised of three core components: heat exposure (derived from LST), sensitivity to heat (influenced by socioeconomic factors), and adaptive capability. Each SA1 is assigned a vulnerability rating ranging from 0 to 5, with 0 indicating no population and 5 representing high vulnerability, based on the aggregated indicator scores and quartile distribution.\nThe methodology employs Google Earth Engine (GEE) to derive LST, NDBI, and NDVI.  The HVI, along with its components, allows for spatial analysis and facilitates understanding of the complex relationships between heat, environmental factors, and socioeconomic conditions, enabling targeted policy and decision-making at local levels. This work aims to support dynamic and interactive vulnerability assessment, enabling users to update and construct their own indicators and indices for diverse applications.\nDetailed methodology for HVI generation can be found in this paper. Additional resources are available on the project's GitHub repository, the web application, and the toolkit.",

    "description": "In 2011 AAM Pty Ltd was commissioned by the Commonwealth to obtain orthophotography of the Cocos (Keeling) Islands. Between the 8th and 16th of August 2011 orthophotography was obtained for the entire extent of the islands (including North Keeling Island) by AAM Pty Ltd using a fixed-wing light aircraft. Previously, aerial photography was captured for Cocos (Keeling) Islands in 1987 and satellite imagery in 2004. The 2011 imagery has a 15cm on ground pixel size resolution, an improvement on all previous imagery.\nUsing an automated process, raw images were joined to form two mosaics, one of the Cocos southern lagoon and one of North Keeling Island. Colour balancing and replacement of certain areas with alternate raw images was performed for consistency. As a guide, the orthophotography is horizontally accurate to 30cm. \nThe orthophotography was provided to Geoscience Australia in UTM WGS 47S. All imagery was captured using a DiMAC UltraLight 50mm Lens camera within approximately 2 hours of low tide. During this period tides ranged from 0.4m to 1.3m. Flying height was around 800 meters with flight line spacing of around half a kilometre. The clarity and resolution is an improvement on the 2006 satellite imagery. \nDisclaimer",

    "title": "Derelict fishing line on fringing reefs of inshore groups of the GBR, 2007-2009 (NERP 8.2, JCU)",
    "description": "This dataset consists of site means of the density of derelict fishing line, the percent cover of major benthic categories on fringing coral reefs of the Keppel, Whitsunday and Palm Island groups, and the accumulation rate of fishing line at ten sites in the Palm Islands between 2007 and 2009. \r\n\r\nMonofilament nylon fishing line is persistent in the marine environment and once entangled in the reef, it can remain in place for many years. Temporal monitoring of the relative number of fishing lines recorded at each site can be used as a proxy for fishing effort. During the last few years we have established a collaboration with ReefCheck Australia to enhance this aspect of the project. In 2007, volunteer divers were tasked with removing all derelict fishing lines from a subset of the monitoring sites in the Palm Islands.  In the last few years, the rate of line re-accumulation has been monitored to gauge relative levels of fishing effort and zoning compliance. \r\n\r\n\r\nMethods:\r\n\r\nUnderwater visual census (UVC) was used to survey derelict fishing lines at 30 sites in the Palm Islands, 42 sites in the Whitsunday Islands and 22 sites in the Keppel Islands during 2009.  Within each island group, half of the sites (n = 47) were located on reefs within NTMRs and half  (n = 47) were on reefs that are open to fishing (non-NTMR).  A proportion of the NTMR sites in each island group were located within ¿old¿ reserves (NTMR 1987) protected since 1987; while others were located within ¿new¿ reserves (NTMR 2004) protected since 2004.\r\n\r\nFive replicate 50 m x 6 m (300 m²) UVC transects were surveyed at each monitoring site by two observers using SCUBA.  The total survey area at each site was 1500 m2.  Transect tapes were deployed along reef slopes, parallel to the reef crest and at a depth between 4 m and 9 m depending on the reef slope topography at each site.\r\nThe benthic community was surveyed using a standard line intercept survey method every 1 m along each transect (50 points per transect). Hard corals were classified as live or dead and assigned into morphological categories (branching, digitate, plate, massive, foliose, encrusting). Other categories of benthos included soft coral, sponges, clams (Tridacna spp.), other invertebrates (such as ascidians and anemones), macro-algae, coral reef pavement, rock, rubble and sand. Reef structural complexity was estimated using a five-point scale for both reef slope angle and rugosity. Five independent structural complexity estimates were made for each transect. Underwater visibility was recorded on each transect and ranged from 6 m to 12 m. Surveys did not proceed if the visibility was less than 5 m.\r\n\r\nTeams of volunteer divers from Reef Check Australia carried out the removal of derelict fishing lines at ten of the monitoring sites in the Palm Islands during April 2007. Five of the cleaned sites were located on reefs within NTMRs and five were on non-NTMR reefs. Four of the cleaned NTMR sites were located on the leeward side of Orpheus Island (NTMR 1987) and one site was at Curacoa Island (NTMR 2004). Of the cleaned non-NTMR sites, four were located on the leeward side of Pelorus Island and one was at Curacoa Island. The ten cleaned sites were randomly selected from a pool of eighteen sites that were in sheltered (leeward) locations and were identified as being readily accessible by fishers during calm to moderate (< 15 knots of wind) weather conditions. \r\n\r\nAt each site, divers removed all sighted derelict fishing lines and tackle (hooks, sinkers, wire leaders etc.) on reef slopes between 4 m and 12 m depth, for 200 m in both directions from a central GPS waypoint marking the site position. Transect tapes were deployed to measure the distance covered and increase the search efficiency so that very few, if any, derelict fishing lines remained after cleanup operations were completed. Derelict lines that were overgrown with hard coral or encrusting sponges, or partially embedded in the reef matrix were cut, and all of the exposed (visible) sections of line were removed. All collected fishing lines were recorded on data sheets before being placed in catch bags and taken back to the boat for later disposal.  \r\n\r\nBaseline UVC surveys of derelict fishing lines were conducted at each of the ten cleaned sites immediately prior to the removal of fishing lines in April 2007 and UVC surveys were subsequently repeated in December 2009, providing a 32 month period for fishing lines to re-accumulate on the reefs.  The 2007 and 2009 UVC surveys on the 10 cleaned sites used the same methodology described in the survey methods section above.  \r\n\r\nWe assumed that all of the fishing lines recorded and collected were lost at the same location in which they were found.  The authors recognize that the removal of derelict fishing line from ten of the thirty sites in the Palm Islands prior to the 2009 surveys would have reduced the fishing line density estimates for the Palm Islands.  However the magnitude of this effect was balanced between old and new NTMRs and non-NTMRs, as only one-third of the monitoring sites in each zone were cleaned.\r\n\r\n\r\nFormat:\r\n\r\nThe data are contained within two worksheets of an Excel file (20 kB). All benthic data is in % cover. Fishing line data are presented as both mean density (mean number of lines per 300 m2) and a total summed value for each site (total number of lines recorded per 1500m2). The first worksheet provides the site-level data for 2009. The second worksheet provides the accumulation rates of fishing lines at 10 monitoring sites in the Palm Islands between their removal in 2007 and the re-survey in 2009.\r\n\r\n\r\nData Dictionary:\r\n\r\nNames in brackets correspond to those used in the shapefile equivalents of the spreadsheet data. These names were adapted to work within the 10 character attribute limitation of shapefiles.\r\n- Fish Line_MEAN (FishLineMn) - mean number of lines recorded over 5 transects surveyed at each 300 m2 site.\r\n- Fish Line_SUM (FishLinSum) - is the pooled number of lines recorded on the 5 transects surveyed at each site. It is the total number of lines found over the 1500m2 surveyed at each site.\r\n- Line Accumulation Rate (LineAccRat) - number of lines accumulated per month.\r\n- SCI_MEAN - Structural complexity Index.. An index (1-25) calculated by multiplying our visual estimates of reef slope angle (1-5) by reef slope rugosity (Complexity 1-5). These values are estimated for each 10m section of each 50m transect. 5 transects per site = 25 SCI estimates per site. The data provided is site means¿ i.e. the mean of those 25 values.\r\n- %LHC_MEAN (LHC_MEAN) - Live hard coral cover (%), live hard coral only.  \r\n\r\n\r\nReferences:\r\n\r\nWilliamson D.H., Ceccarelli D.M., Evans R.D., Hill J.K., Russ G.R.

This data is collected using revenue quality meters across each supply line (feeder) into the plant, and Melbourne Water owned power meters for generation measurements. Melbourne Water collects and stores this feeder data as 15 minute interval data, and the generation data at real time. The data in this file summarises the electricity consumption and generation as daily usage. The time period associated with each day has been converted to a UTC time zone. This data set allows year on year comparison or daily usage against atmospheric changes i.e. temperature variance, rainfall. Feeder 1 and Feeder 2 can be combined to obtain the total Grid Electricity Consumption for ETP, and combined with the total electricity Generation to obtain the total Electricity consumption for ETP.NOTE: Whilst every effort has been taken in collecting, validating and providing the attached data, Melbourne Water Corporation makes no representations or guarantees as to the accuracy or completeness of this data.

    "description": "This record describes, and links to a working paper published through the Economics and Environment Network at The Australian National University in Canberra. The paper was prepared for the International Workshop on Fishing Vessel and License Buy-Back Programs, held at the University of California between March 22nd-24th, 2004. \n*****\nPolicy makers have implemented five distinct buybacks of either vessels or salmon licenses over the past three decades in the British Columbia (BC) salmon fishery. The earliest buyback was one of the first of its kind in any fishery and the most recent buyback is one of the largest ever in terms of reducing vessel numbers and the funds used. This paper reviews the circumstances under which these buybacks were conducted with an emphasis on their impact on reducing fishing capacity and effort. The focus is on the two most recent buybacks that took place in 1996 and 1998-2000, what has been learned and what they have achieved.",

    "description": "Australian Defence Airfields ANEF ANEC\r\n\r\nDevelopment - Australian Noise Exposure Forecast (ANEF). \r\n(Ref: https://www.defence.gov.au/AircraftNoise/Default.asp) \r\n\r\nHomeowners should be familiar with their local Australian Noise Exposure Forecast (ANEF) maps, which provide the best information about aircraft noise exposure near Defence bases. \r\n\r\nANEF maps provide a forecast of noise for a future year, made by both civilian and military aircraft for that location. They do not show every flight and homeowners with properties outside of the ANEF map zones may still experience aircraft noise. \r\n\r\nOne of the most effective ways to reduce the impact of aircraft noise is through proper land planning by local Town Councils. \r\n\r\nDepartment of Defence ANEF maps \r\n\r\nANEF maps are usually updated every five to ten years, as a result of new noise information (for example, an older aircraft may be retired and a new aircraft may be introduced) or when the current map passes its forecast date. Because ANEF maps are a forecast, the map will always include the year that is forecasted. For example, the RAAF Base Williamtown 2025 ANEF is a forecast for the year 2025, and incorporates noise modelling for the F-35A Joint Strike Fighter. \r\n\r\nProperties purchased near airports and bases are always likely to experience some degree of aircraft noise, which will increase or decrease with changes in use. \r\n\r\nANEF Maps should be read in conjunction with Australian Standard 2021 – 2000 Acoustics - Aircraft Noise Intrusion - Building Siting and Construction. \r\n\r\nhttps://www.defence.gov.au/aircraftnoise/_master/docs/anef/AS2021-2000%20Table%202-1.pdf",

The data provides a revision of existing vegetation mapping with scored sensitivity values for a range of criteria, used to derive a sensitivity index. This will aid in the determination of areas that may be suitable for World Heritage listing throughout the Cessnock Local Government Area.\n\n* The GIS mapping data were obtained to inform sustainability planning for the Lower Hunter region, particularly to assist in informing the NSW Government review of the NSW Lower Hunter regional strategy and Lower Hunter regional conservation plan.\n* Once this review is complete, the second stage is to undertake a strategic assessment of proposed urban development and related infrastructure corridors.

In the north-west of the State flooding is most likely to be caused by the summer monsoon or tropical cyclones while floods in the south-west are more likely to occur in response to heavy winter rainfalls.\n\nWhile historical flood records and information extend as far back as 1830, detailed information on peak flood levels is typically limited to the last few decades.\n\nThis dataset shows the extent of flooding (polylines) that has occurred during major flood events in Western Australia.\n\nNote: To see the full scope of the historical flood mapping, 3 dataset layers are required to be loaded in the following order:\n\nFLOODPLAIN DATASET LAYERS:    \nFPM Historical Flood Levels (m AHD)\nFPM Historical Extent of Flooding\nFPM Historical Floodplain Area\n\nThe major flood events that are covered in this dataset are:\n\nBow Bridge Townsite (June 1988)\nCorrigin Townsite (January 1982)\nEsperance Townsite (January 2007)\nKupungarri to Willare (including Dales Yard &amp; Mount Joseph gauging stations) - Fitzroy River (January 2023) \nLake Grace Townsite (January 2006)\nMerredin Townsite (February 1979)\nPerth (February 2017)\nTambellup Townsite (January 1982)\nWarmun Aboriginal Community (March 2011)\nYork Townsite (July 2021, August 2022)\n\nOther major flood events that have occurred in the past include:\n\nBlackwood River (1945, 1955, 1963, 1964, 1982)\nCollie River (1945, 1963, 1964, 1974, 1982)\nFitzroy River (1983, 1986, 1991, 1993, 2002, 2011)\nGascoyne River (1960, 1961, 1980, 1995, 2000, 2010)\nGreenough River (1888, 1927, 1953, 1971, 1988, 1999, 2006)\nMoore River (1934, 1955, 1961, 1995, 1999)\nMurray River (1862, 1945, 1955, 1964)\nPreston River (1964, 1967, 1974, 1983, 1990, 2011)\nSwan River (1862, 1872, 1945, 1955, 1964, 1983)\n\nThe historical flood information is used in the Department of Water and Environmental Regulation's floodplain management activities to ensure that floodplains are managed for the benefit of the whole community, minimising the risk and damages and protecting environmental values.\n\nFloodplain mapping datasets and floodplain development strategies for rivers and major watercourses in Western Australia are also available from the Department of Water and Environmental Regulation.\n\nGLOSSARY:\n<ul>\n<li>\n\nAnnual exceedance probability (AEP) - the likelihood of occurrence of a flood of a given size or larger in any one year; usually expressed as a percentage.\n</li>\n<li>\n\n1 in 100 AEP flood - this means that there is a 1 in 100 (or 1%) chance of a flow of this size or larger occurring in any one year. This flood has a 50% chance of being experienced at least once in a person's lifetime. The 1 in 100 AEP flood has been generally adopted in Australia and overseas as the basis for floodplain management planning.\n</li>\n<li>\n\nFloodplain - the portion of a river valley next to the river channel which is covered with water when the river overflows its banks during major river flows. The term also applies to land adjacent to estuaries which is subject to flooding.\n</li>\n<li>\n\nAustralian Height Datum (AHD) - is a geodetic datum for altitude measurement in Australia. It was adopted in 1971 by the National Mapping Council as the datum to which all vertical control for mapping is to be referred. The datum is based on the mean sea level (1966-1968) being assigned the value 0.000m on the Australian Height Datum (AHD) at 30 tide gauges around the coast of the Australian continent.\n</li>\n</ul>",

    "description": "Data collected as part of the City of Melbourne's Census of Land Use and Employment (CLUE). The data covers the period 2002-2022. It shows floor space (in square meters) per city (CLUE) block, classified by their ANZSIC1 industry and small area allocation. \n\nThe City of Melbourne creates unique codes to account for floor space allocated to residential space, vacant space, open space and common area. These unique codes are not included within ANZSIC 1 classification and therefore these floor areas are not included in this data set.\n\nThis data set has been confidentialised to protect the commercially sensitive information of individual businesses. Data in cells which pertain to two or fewer businesses have been suppressed and are shown as a blank cell. The row and column totals refer to the true total, including those suppressed cells.\n\nNon-confidentialised data may be made available subject to a data supply agreement. For more information contact clue@melbourne.vic.gov.au\n\nFor CLUE block spatial files see https://data.melbourne.vic.gov.au/explore/dataset/blocks-for-census-of-land-use-and-employment-clue/information/\n\nFor more information about CLUE see http://www.melbourne.vic.gov.au/clue\n\nFor more information about the ANZSIC industry classification system see http://www.abs.gov.au/ausstats/abs@.nsf/mf/1292.0",

    "description": "The Fence Handrail Feature Class sits within the National Parks and Wildlife Service (NPWS) Assets Geodatabase.  The Fence Handrail polyline layer includes either fences or handrails.   \n\nThe Assets Geodatabase is directly related to the Assets Maintenance System (AMS) which runs under SAP and contains similar fields, values and business rules. The Assets Geodatabase is the vehicle in which spatial assets are initially captured, edited and stored so that the features have coordinates and can be viewed spatially.   The data is collected across the entire NSW National Parks Estate and includes some off-park features for fire management, access and mapping purposes.  The spatial feature data is manually synchronised with the AMS.  The two systems run side by side and are linked by an ID field.  AMS is also set up to be used by other Department Planning, Industry &amp; Environment groups eg. Botanic Gardens and Parklands and previously Marine Parks.\n\nThe database includes the following asset Feature Class types - Barrier, Bridge or Elevated Walkway, Building, Communication Equipment, Crossing, Drainage Point, Environmental Monitoring Station, Extractive industry, Facility, Fence Handrail, Fire Management Zone, Gate, Hazards, Hydraulic Point, Hydraulic Storage Point, Hydraulic Valve, Irrigation System, Landing, Landing Strip, Lookout, Natural Feature, Other Structure, Parking Area, Pipe Channel Section, Power or Communication line, Power or Communication point, Sign, Step point, Stormwater Drainage Line, Surface, Survey Mark, Tower, Track Section, Treatment Disposal System, Visitor Area, Visitor Monitoring Point.\nDetailed documentation is available including:\n-  Data Dictionary (internal location - P:\\Corporate\\Tools\\Information\\Assets)\n-  Data Model\n-  Business Rules\n-  Functional Location and Naming Convention\n\nNote that for external supply the dataset is simplified with certain attribute fields being removed.  Those fields that have a name prefixed with \"d_\" contain descriptions extracted from the original geodatabase domains.",

    "description": "This data set shows the occupancy and size of spectacled flying-fox camps across the distribution of the spectacled flying-fox in the Wet Tropics Region.  Camp locations are also provided.  Data was collected monthly and all camps in the region were monitored each month.\r\n\r\nThis data was collected to provide information on the dynamics in abundance and distribution of the spectacled flying-fox.  It is part of a long term monitoring program that has been running since 2004. For further information see the publicaton:\r\nTait, J., Perotto-Baldivieso, H. L., McKeown, A., & Westcott, D. A. (2014). Are Flying-Foxes Coming to Town? Urbanisation of the Spectacled Flying-Fox (Pteropus conspicillatus) in Australia. DOI: 10.1371/journal.pone.0109810\r\n\r\nThis dataset is a subset of the complete time series corresponding to the collection period of the NERP TE program, from June 2011 - Oct 2014.\r\n\r\nMethods:\r\n\r\nMonthly surveys were conducted as daytime ground counts and followed the methodology outlined for the National Flying-fox Monitoring Program (Westcott et al. 2011; http://www.environment.gov.au/system/files/pages/391f5fed-e287-4dd3-85ac-640037926ef5/files/310112-monitoring-methodology.pdf).  Surveys were conducted by a single surveyor.  All camps were surveyed over a 2-3 day period.\r\n\r\n\r\nLimitations:\r\n\r\nThis data covers the ¿counted¿ population only.  An unknown and variable proportion of the population roost in unknown locations.\r\n\r\n\r\nFormat:\r\n\r\nThe data is provided as a 28 kb Excel file with camp names, latitude and longitude of camp location and columns for each survey month.  Camps are never dropped from the survey so blanks represent camps with no spectacled flying-foxes present during the survey.\r\n\r\n\r\nReferences:\r\n\r\nWestcott D. A. & McKeown A.

    "description": "This dataset is the June 2022 release of Geoscape Planning for a single SA2 area (Canberra) with SA2 code (81113).\nPlanning provides detailed planning zone codes and descriptions for parcels of land across Australia. By representing the detailed planning classification for each parcel as well as links to the relevant planning scheme/instrument. Planning provides a simple lookup for the classification on sites nationally, as well as linkages to enable further understanding of a site's potential. Planning is created through combining Geoscape Australia's Cadastre product with Planning Zones defined by a State, Territory or Local Government.\nFor more information regarding Geoscape Planning, please refer to the Data Product Description and the June 2022 Release Notes.\nPlease note: As per the licence for this data, the information is limited to a single Level 2 Statistical Area (SA2) mentioned above as defined by the Australian Bureau of Statistics. If you require additional data beyond a single SA2 for your research, please request a quote from AURIN.\nPlanning zones provide a method to divide land and describe the types of development that may occur at a location, and often describe other developmental requirements such as the height, setback or form of the structures that can be built. Planning zones allow State, Territory and local Governments to facilitate urban planning and control the development of land.\nThrough representing the planning classification from a planning zone at a Cadastre cadastral parcel level, Planning provides a granular representation of the potential for development at each site, alongside URL linkages to enable further research directly from the authoritative definition.\nThis dataset has been restricted to the Canberra East SA2 by AURIN. AURIN has extracted the selected SA2 area information from this dataset through using geometries from the May 2022 Geoscape Cadastre release. The dataset, therefore, is a tabular dataset for cthe selected SA2 area. ",

    "description": "This dataset presents the footprint of the number of installations of solar water heater (SWH) solar panel systems. The data spans the months of 2018 and includes a total for the year. The data is aggregated to Postal Areas (POAs) from the 2016 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nEvery month the Clean Energy Regulator (CER) publishes small-scale renewable energy installation data files. These data files provide a list of small generation units (SGU) (small-scale solar panel, wind and hydro systems) and kW capacity by installed postcode, and SWH and air source heat pumps by installed postcode. The data represents all systems that have had certificates validly created against them. The data includes new installations, upgrades to existing systems and stand-alone (off-grid) systems. This data is not publicly available via the Renewable Energy Certificate (REC) Registry and does not include systems that are pending registration or have been failed by the CER.\nFor further information about this dataset, visit the data source:Clean Energy Regulator - Postcode Data for Small-scale Installations.\nPlease note:\n\n\nA 12 month creation period for registered persons to create small-scale technology certificates applies under the Renewable Energy (Electricity) Act 2000.\n\n\nSmall-scale technology certificates are calculated based on the life of the system. This differs for solar hot water heaters and small generation units (solar panels, wind and hydro). \n\n\nThis data is current as at 28-02-2021.\n\n\nFurther information can be found at theRenewable Energy Target FAQ.\n AURIN has made the following change to the original data:\n\n\nSpatially enabled the original data by joining the data with the 2016 ASGS POAs\n\n",

    "description": "Bush Fire Prone Land is mapped within a local government area, which becomes the trigger for planning for bush fire protection. Bush Fire Prone Land mapping is intended to designate areas of the State that are considered to be higher bush fire risk for development control purposes. Not being designated bush fire prone is not a guarantee that losses from bush fires will not occur. The NSW Bush Fire Prone Land dataset is a map prepared in accordance with the Guide for Bush Fire Prone Land Mapping (BFPL Mapping Guide) and certified by the Commissioner of NSW RFS under purposes of Section 10.3 of the Environmental Planning and Assessment Act 1979 No 203. \nOver time there has been various releases of the BFPL Mapping Guide, in which the categories and types of vegetation included in the BFPL map have changed. The version of the guide under which, each polygon or LGA was certified is contained in the data. \nBFPL is an area of land that can support a bush fire or is likely to be subject to bush fire attack, as designated on a bush fire prone land map. The definition of bushfire vegetation categories under guideline version 5b: * Vegetation Category 1 consists of: &gt; Areas of forest, woodlands, heaths (tall and short), forested wetlands and timber plantations. * Vegetation Category 2 consists of: &gt;Rainforests. &gt;Lower risk vegetation parcels. These vegetation parcels represent a lower bush fire risk to surrounding development and consist of: - Remnant vegetation; - Land with ongoing land management practices that actively reduces bush fire risk. * Vegetation Category 3 consists of: &gt; Grasslands, freshwater wetlands, semi-arid woodlands, alpine complex and arid shrublands. * Buffers are created based on the bushfire vegetation, with buffering distance being 100 metres for vegetation category 1 and 30 metres for vegetation category 2 and 3. \nVegetation excluded from the bushfire vegetation categories include isolated areas of vegetation less than one hectare, managed lands and some agricultural lands. Please refer to BFPL Mapping Guide for a full list of exclusions.\nThe legislative context of this dataset is as follows: On 1 August 2002, the Rural Fires and Environmental Assessment Legislation Amendment Act 2002 (Amendment Act) came into effect. The Act amended both the Environmental Planning and Assessment Act 1979 and the Rural Fire Services Act 1997 to ensure that people, property and the environment are more fully protected against the dangers that may arise from bushfires. Councils are required to map bushfire prone land within their local government area, which becomes the trigger for the consideration of bushfire protection measures when developing land. BFPL Mapping Guidelines are available from www.rfs.nsw.gov.au\nhttp://www.rfs.nsw.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0011/4412/Guideline-for-Councils-to-Bushfire-Prone-Area-Land-Mapping.pdf",

The voyage took place from 11-22 November 2021 departing from Hobart (TAS) and returning to Hobart (TAS).\nThe Kongsberg SBP120 (sub bottom profiler) was used to acquire data containing the specular reflections at different sediment interfaces below the seafloor. The SBP120 provides a 3° by 3° angular resolution.\nThe echosounder's frequency sweep range is from 2.5 to 7 kHz. The SBP120 was logged continuously for the extent of the voyage.\nData are stored in .raw ( 1332 files 7.99GB) raw and .seg (XX files XX GB) segy formats at CSIRO.\nThe segy format data had a real time processing stream applied, which applies gain, a gain correction, matched filter with replica shaping, an attribute calculation for instantaneous amplitude and time variable gain.\nAdditional information regarding this dataset is contained in the GSM data acquisition and processing report.

    "description": "Two 'Pulse' mooring platforms were deployed on the 5/10/2008, a 'Light' model and a 'Heavy' model mooring.\n\nInstruments on the mooring collect the parameters listed in the lineage field, below.\n\nAttached are the data files of those readings, as well as graphed results and some animations of the movement of the PULSE over time.\n\n\nBackground:\n=========\nMoored instruments are deployed by the IMOS SOTS facility for time-series observations of physical, biological, and chemical properties, in the Sub-Antarctic Zone southwest of Tasmania , with twice-yearly servicing. \n\nThese time-series observations are crucial to resolving ecosystem processes that affect carbon cycling, ocean productivity and marine responses to climate variability and change, ocean acidification and other stresses. \n\nThis is one of only 29 high temporal resolution sites identified globally and 1 of 3 proposed for the Southern Ocean. \n\nPulse is a platform still under development. The design challenge for Pulse is not only to create a surface mooring that can endure the Southern Ocean but one that dampens the accelerations the surface float experiences enough so that the water sampler and biogeochemical sensors can function and survive long deployments.",

    "description": "A detailed study of flood behaviour of the Macquarie River at\nDubbo has been undertaken.\n\nThe peak discharge for the 100 years event was estimated taking into account the behaviour of Burrendong Dam and a joint flood frequency study with flows from the Bell River. Flood levels, flood velocities and the floodway limits were determined for the 100 year event using the HEC-2 water surface profile computer program.\n\nA preliminary assessment of flood damages in Dubbo showed that the average annual damages are in the order of $137,000. Under 100 years flood conditions approximately 15 residential properties and 47 commercial properties would be inundated by floodwaters up to 2.9m deep.\n\nThe presence an operation of Burrendong Dam has been assessed as significantly reducing the impact of flooding at Dubbo. Additional structural mitigation measures have not been recommended.\n\nNon structural  methods in particular flood warning and flood awareness strategies and development controls are considered to be appropriate measures for Dubbo.\n\nFor verification of the hydraulic model and the monitoring of future floods, it is recommended that a system of peak flood level indicators be installed. It is also recommended that for floods that exceed 9m on the Pump Station gauge additional peak flood levels be obtained throughout the study.\nobtatned .thrgMflput t2w .ud",

    "description": "This dataset is one of a number of datasets containing geomorphological data relating to the Windmill Islands, Wilkes Land, Antarctica. The dataset comprises of a digital point coverage of glacial sediments, collected and identified from documented field observations compiled by Dr Ian D Goodwin from his own field notes as well as topographic and surface features identified and interpreted on aerial photographs taken by AUSLIG (now Geoscience Australia) in the 1993-94 field season. Each marine incursion sediment sample is represented as a point which is linked to a separate digital database (ie attribute tables) containing additional information. Sediment samples collected predominantly along the shoreline of these lakes represent a chronology of glacial events/influences on these lakes. Sediment samples taken as a profiled sequence or core can be dated using radiocarbon dating to provide a chronological picture and age occurance of deglaciation and glaciation cycles within the  Windmill Islands.",

The results are presented as a mean, minimum and maximum result of the NSW and Australian Regional Climate Modelling (NARCliM) ensemble (representing 10 Global Climate Model results) for each gridded point, as well as a standard deviation to reveal the statistical range between model results.\n\nRelative change files (difference between the future and baseline prediction) are also available for each of the calculations i.e. annual and seasonal mean, standard deviation, minimum, maximum. \nThe data is bias corrected, and users are encouraged to read the CSI technical fact sheet for further information on this, and data limitations. It also includes background information on the project and datasets, explanations of technical terms such as Global Climate Models (GCMs), Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs) and further information about the projections. It also contains important advice regarding using the data appropriately. \n\nFuture updates to this dataset may include regional and global climate model specific data at a 4-kilometre resolution, as well as a third ‘middle of the road’ scenario (SSP2-4.5).\n\nThe data naming protocol is outlined in the technical information factsheet available under Data and Resources.\n\n•   Frequently asked questions - https://www.wa.gov.au/service/environment/environment-information-services/climate-science-initiative-frequently-asked-questions\n\n•   Climate Science Initiative - https://www.wa.gov.au/organisation/department-of-water-and-environmental-regulation/climate-science-initiative",

    "description": "Long-term average annual extraction limit (LTAAEL) is a regulatory limit set on annual water extractions from a river system. It ensures that average extractions over the long term are sustainable, and thus help prevent environmental degradation.\n\nIn NSW these limits are defined by water sharing plans (WSPs). Every WSP outlines how the water in a river system will be shared over a 10-year period. They also define:\n\n• how LTAAEL compliance is to be assessed for each river system\n\n• what conditions will trigger noncompliance action\n\n• what compliance action can be taken.\n\nThe Natural Resources Commission regularly reviews all WSPs to ensure extractions from each river system are within the limits set, and the Murray-Darling Basin Authority reviews sustainable diversion limit (SDL) compliance each year.\n\nTo assess compliance, we model LTAAEL using a model that has been configured to represent the development and management rules defined by a system WSP (this refers to as LTAAEL model). We then compare this modelled LTAAEL with the modelled under current conditions long-term average annual extractions (LTAAEs) (which are usually those modelled by the annual permitted take, or APT, model). Although, the LTAAEL includes multiple types of water use, the compliance assessment is based on the total. We do this annually using the best available models, and the outcomes are published on the DPE website.\n\nWhere river system’s LTAAE exceed LTAAEL, the system is considered noncompliant. If the noncompliance trigger conditions in the WSP are met, noncompliance action is taken.\n\nThe data set provided contains flows at several gauges in each river system, as simulated by the annually extended LTAAEL model. Notwithstanding the model’s inherent limitations, these are a fair representation of those we would expect under WSP operation and development conditions. They can be compared with flows simulated by other key scenario models, such as annual permitted take (APT) model or without development (WOD) model.",

    "description": "Part of the Vicmap Admin dataset series. This layer contains polygon features delineating the current Country Fire Authority Region Boundaries.\nIn 2010, CFA moved to align their administrative boundaries to the Victorian Government Regional Departmental Boundaries. As a result of this direction, from 1st July 2010, what was once known as CFA Areas will now be known as CFA Regions.\nThere are three exceptions in this dataset. In June 2011, Bass Coast Shire became part of Southern Metropolitan Region when the Victorian Government Regional Departmental Boundaries indicate that it should be part of Gippsland Region. In October 2012, Yarriambiack Shire was divided using the east-west rabbit fence (same as the Total Fire Ban District Boundary) which impacts on the Loddon Mallee and Grampians Regions boundary. In August 2013, the gazetted boundary prior to the mapping changes made as part of the Boundary Alignment Project at Inverloch Brigade, were reinstated impacting on the boundary ajoining Southern Metropolitan and Gippsland Regions.\nOn the 2nd October 2014, CFA's eight Regions became five. This involved the merger of Hume and Eastern Metropolitan Regions to form North East Region, and Loddon Mallee and Northern &amp; Western Metropolitan Regions to form North West Region. The other Regions were also renamed. These changes were a part of the Creating our Future Together (COFT) Program.",

    "description": "Permanency is defined as the capacity for carbon to be preserved and not reworked under conditions of higher hydrodynamic energy associated with storms and changes to tidal regimes. The permanency of carbon within substrates has been questioned (DeLaune and White, 2012; Kirwan and Mudd, 2012), particularly in the context of increased storminess. This component does not specifically indicate retreat pathways for coastal ecosystems as they respond to sea-level rise. Lower elevations on estuarine shorelines may be exposed to greater hydrodynamic energy due to fetch and wave-action, whilst coastal barrier sediments are more exposed to high wave energy of the open ocean; the exposure of these sediments to higher hydrodynamic energy increases the probability of reworking and poses considerable risk to carbon permanency. \nDeLaune, R., and White, J. (2012). Will coastal wetlands continue to sequester carbon in response to an increase in global sea level?: a case study of the rapidly subsiding Mississippi river deltaic plain. Climatic Change 110, 297-314.\nKirwan, M.L., and Mudd, S.M. (2012). Response of salt-marsh carbon accumulation to climate change. Nature 489, 550-553.",

This dataset contains a snapshot of the point-of-truth asset database extracted on 23 May 2019.

    "description": "Annual permitted take (APT) is a critical component of sustainable resource management, balancing the need for water resource utilisation with the preservation of ecosystems. It is a crucial mechanism for ensuring the long-term annual sustainable diversion limits (SDLs) set under the Murray-Darling Basin Plan are not exceeded, and that enough water is available for the environment. APT is the maximum amount of water permitted to be taken for consumptive purposes each year, and has been enforced since July 2019\n\nA method for determining APT is part of each water resource plans (WRPs) developed by the Basin states under the Commonwealth Water Act 2007. When the method is applied over the Basin Plan reference period (1895–2009), the annual APT must be equal to or less than SDL.\n\nAn APT model is a major component of the APT calculation method. It is used to calculate the APT that would be expected in a year, given that year’s water availability and climatic conditions. APT is calculated at the end of each year and compared to actual take in that year, with the difference added to a public register of take. SDL compliance is tracked using the cumulative difference (from water year 2019–20).\n\nAPT models are configured using estimates of the river management and development (public and private infrastructure) conditions in a river system across the water resource plan period. These estimates include:\n\n• irrigated crop area and planting decisions\n\n• water entitlement holders’ distribution and use patterns\n\n• how storages are operated to supply water for consumption and the environment.",

    "description": "This data was collected in June 2011 by the IMOS Ship of Opportunity Underway CO2 Measurement research group on RV Southern Surveyor (IMOS platform code: VLHJ) voyage SS2011_T02.\n\nDeparted: \tAuckland, NZ,   June 06, 2011\nArrived:   \tHobart, TAS,   June 14, 2011\n\nCO2 System Overview:\nThe fugacity of carbon dioxide (fCO2) in surface seawater was measured using a General Oceanics Inc. automated system (Model 8050; Pierrot et al 2009). Seawater is sprayed into an equilibration chamber and CO2 in the headspace gas equilibrates with the seawater. The headspace gas is pumped through a thermoelectric condenser followed by a nafion drying tube before flowing through a Licor 7000 non-dispersive infrared gas analyser used to measure the CO2 mole fraction (XCO2) of the dried air. The gas flow is stopped temporarily for the CO2 measurements, which are made at atmospheric pressure. A set of four CO2 standards that cover the range of CO2 values expected in the ocean are analysed about every four hours to calibrate the gas analyser. The standard gas concentrations are on the WMO-X2007 mole fraction scale for CO2-in-air. Atmospheric XCO2 (dry) is measured after the standards by pumping clean outside air from an intake on the forward mast of the ship. \n\nSeawater intake and ancillary data:\nThe seawater intake is located at about 5.5m depth in the bow of the ship. Sea surface salinity is measured using a thermosalinograph (Seabird Electronics SBE21) located next to the CO2 system. A remote temperature sensor (Seabird Electronics SBE 38) located at the intake is used to measure sea surface temperature (SST). The travel time between the intake and CO2 system is typically about 4 minutes with warming usually less than 0.6ºC. The thermosalinograph water is from the same intake, but the supply lines separate after the intake. A comparison of thermosalinograph and equilibrator temperature records shows the temperature difference in the two lines is generally less than 0.1ºC. The thermosalinograph water line travels outside the ship and is typically warmer than the equilibrator. The travel time in water line to the thermosalinograph is 2.5 minutes faster than to the equilibrator. \n\nMeteorological data, salinity, SST, and ships position and time are taken from the ships logging system. These parameters and the data quality are maintained by the Australian Marine National Facility.",
