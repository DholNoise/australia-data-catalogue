    "description": "The NISB Habitat Map was created by the University of Tasmania for a partnership between the Department of Climate Change and the National Land and Water Resources Audit. It supports the DCC/Audit partnership by providing a nationally consistent set of the available mapping data for those habitats that occur between the approximate position of the highest astronomical tide mark (HAT) and the location of the outer limit of the photic benthic zone (approximately at the 50-70 m depth contour). This area is broadly equivalent to the 'inner' and 'mid-shelf' regions identified by Geoscience Australia. The resulting map data set forms a core component of the ECM National Habitat Map Series. The habitat classes include: coral reef, rock dominated habitat, sediment dominated habitat, mangroves, saltmarsh, seagrass, macroalgae and filter feeders (e.g. sponges), as defined in the NISB Habitat Classification Scheme. The scheme is designed to support the development of marine 'ecoregions' or bioregional subregions. Details of the scheme and the process of its development are available in National Intertidal/Subtidal Benthic (NISB) Habitat Classification Scheme Version 1 (Mount, Bricher and Newton, 2007). The NISB Habitat Map consists of two layers for each state. _NISB.shp consists of the entire available habitat mapping at a resolution finer than 1:50 000 (with a few exceptions, outlined in the data quality section below). _NISB_PLUS.shp consists of all the data in _NISB.shp along with coarser resolution data, including NVIS and OzEstuaries data. These layers were used to produce the National ECM Key Habitat Distribution Map Series 10 km and 50 km tile maps.\r\n\r\nNote: This data is labelled as “NISB_plus”, indicating that it is the NISB Habitat layer plus other lower quality layers.",

    "description": "The Australian Continuous Plankton Recorder (AusCPR) survey is a joint project between CSIRO Oceans and Atmosphere (O&amp;A) and the Australian Antarctic Division (AAD) to measure plankton communities as a guide to the health of Australia's oceans. The biomass is analysed from the same segment from which the zooplankton is analysed. All the plankton is washed onto a pre-weighed filter. This is left in an oven at 60 degrees C for 24-48 hours.  It is reweighed to give the dry weight. It is advised that anyone using the data should contact the project contact person. The aims of the AusCPR survey are to: * map plankton biodiversity and distribution * develop the first long-term plankton baseline for Australian waters * document plankton changes in response to climate change * provide indices for fisheries management * detect harmful algal blooms * validate satellite remote sensing * initialise and test ecosystem models.  Servicing and maintenance of the CPRs and analysis of the samples for the AusCPR survey will be carried out by staff based at the O&amp;A CSIRO laboratories in Queensland and Hobart and at the AAD in Hobart. The project was funded by the Integrated Marine Observing System (IMOS) and falls with the Ships of Opportunity facility. Data storage and access is planned to be interoperable with other national and international programs through the IMOS Infrastructure. Results from the AusCPR survey are available through the AODN portal: https://portal.aodn.org.au. This data is freely available but please acknowledge all relevant parties, as detailed in acknowledgement section.",

    "description": "The Cooks River catchment is a major watershed within Sydney, draining some 103 km2 and is home to 560,265 people (ABS, 2020). As such, Cooks River is a key catchment in terms of floodplain risk management within New South Wales. The Cooks River catchment extends across multiple Local Government Areas (LGAs) and is of interest to several other state government agencies and community groups. \n\nThis project is the Cooks River Catchment Flood Study Stage 1 and is the first stage of a catchment-wide Flood Study for the Cooks River catchment. Stage 1 aims to consolidate an \nextensive range of datasets, including existing models from Flood Studies and Floodplain Risk Management Studies and Plans. Many of these studies have been supported by the NSW Floodplain Risk Management Program, whilst some have been separately undertaken. The outcome of Stage 1 is a framework to support the development of an integrated and regional floodplain risk management plan in the catchment and to define the basis of future modelling and catchment-wide consideration of flood risk.

There are some exceptions for features such as rivers, and multi-part polygons which may have widely separated parts. \n\nThis dataset is used to create the property_view_dvp and parcel_view_dvp datasets. These datasets have a \"display\" column which can be used to limit the display of the property or parcel polygons to appropriate scales. These datasets can be used to improve the efficiency of web mapping.\n\nThe polygons will be updated on an occasional basis to include newly subdivided areas.",

Volume 2 details the results of flood behaviour studies of\neach of the creeks.\n\nUndertaking of the flood studies on the creeks was an important first step in the process of\npreparing the FRMP. The flood study is the formal starting process of defining management\nmeasures for flood liable land and represents a detailed technical investigation of flood\nbehaviour.\n\nThis Volume describes the method and results of the investigation to define flooding conditions\non the catchments under both present day conditions and after development according to\nCouncil’s current zoning policy. The study then reviews the impacts of flooding on existing urban\ndevelopment and improvements to the drainage system which could be implemented to mitigate\nflood impacts.",

    "description": "\n## **Abstract** \nThe dataset was compiled by the Geological and Bioregional Assessment Program from multiple sources referenced within the dataset and/or metadata. The processes undertaken to compile this dataset are described in the History field in this metadata statement. The dataset was developed to assist in the classification of permanent waterholes in the Cooper GBA region.\n\n\n## **Attribution** \nGeological and Bioregional Assessment Program\n\n\n## **History** \nThe dataset contains two shapefiles. The first (COO_Lakes_WH_WFS.shp) contains all the lakes and waterholes identified in the 250K topo maps and uses the Water Observations From Space dataset to find the pixel within each polygon that has the maximum proportion of time inundated (MAX field). Waterholes that are inundated more than 70% of the time (MAX>0.70) are considered to be semi-permanent, those that are inundated more than 95% (MAX>0.95) are considered to be permanent. The second dataset (perm_WH_DTWT.shp) is looking at the depth to water table beneath waterholes. There are no dedicated observation bore networks to look at groundwater levels beneath waterholes so this dataset is using the closest water level observation up to a maximum of 5 km away. The field NEAR_DIST is the distance of the bore from the waterhole and the field WH_DTWT is the  depth to water table below the waterhole assuming that the groundwater level is the same as that in the borehole within 5 km. A positive value in WH_DTWT means that the groundwater level is below the water level of the waterhole, a negative value means that the groundwater level is above the water level of the water hole.",

    "title": "Collation of spatial seagrass data (meadow extent polygons, species presence/absence points) from 1984 - 2014 for the Great Barrier Reef World Heritage Area (GBRWHA) (NESP TWQ 3.1, TropWATER, JCU)",
    "description": "This dataset summarises 30 years of seagrass data collection (1984-2014) within the Great Barrier Reef World Heritage Area.  The Site data describes seagrass at 66,210 sites; while the Meadow data describes seagrass at 1,169 individual or composite meadows.  The data includes information on species, meadow type and age and reliability of the data.  The dataset is available as shapefiles, GIS layer packages, and/or a CSV file.  Data represented in this dataset has been collected by the TropWATER Seagrass Group and CSIRO in a GIS database.\r\n\r\nIn making this data publicly available for management, the authors from the TropWATER Seagrass Group request being contacted and involved in decision making processes that incorporate this data, to ensure its limitations are fully understood. The site and meadow GIS available on eAtlas should be considered a ¿living¿ document that will be updated and modified as new data become available.\r\n\r\nMethods:\r\n\r\nThe sampling methods used to study, describe and monitors seagrass meadows were developed by the TropWATER Seagrass Group and tailored to the location and habitat surveyed; these are described in detail in the relevant publications (https://research.jcu.edu.au/tropwater). Methods for data sets collected by CSIRO are reported in Pitcher et al (2007). \r\n1. Location ¿ Latitudes and longitudes are from converted RADAR fix or GPS. Depth is depth below mean sea level (dbMSL) in metres.\r\n2. Seagrass metrics ¿ Visual estimation methods prior to 1990 were mostly percent cover estimates matched to standard photographs. Data limitations for these early surveys are specific to each survey and advice from the TropWATER data custodians should be sought for assistance with interpretation. For recent surveys (post-1990) above-ground biomass was determined using a ¿visual estimates of biomass¿ technique (Mellors 1991) using trained observers. A linear regression was calculated for the relationship between the observer ranks and the harvested values. This regression was used to calculate above-ground biomass for all estimated ranks made from the survey sites. Biomass ranks were converted into above-ground biomass estimates in grams dry weight per square metre (g DW m-2) for each site. Observers estimated biomass data using video transects, grabs, free diving, helicopter and walking:\r\n* Video transect: Commonly used for subtidal meadows at each transect site. A CCTV camera was lowered to the bottom and towed at drift speed (less than one knot). Footage was observed on a TV monitor and digitally recorded. The recording was paused at random times and frames selected. From this frame, an observer estimated a rank of seagrass biomass and a species composition. On completion of the video analysis, the video observer ranked five additional quadrats that had been previously videoed for calibration. The camera sled included a small collecting net to obtain a specimen for identification. \r\n* van Veen grab: Commonly used for subtidal meadows. A sample of seagrass was collected using a van Veen grab (grab area 0.0625 m2) to identify species present at each site. Species identified from the grab sample were used to inform species composition assessments made from the recorded video transects (Kuo and McComb 1989), or to record presence/absence where visibility was too poor for video transects. \r\n* Free diving, helicopter and walking: At each site seagrass above-ground biomass and species composition were estimated from 0.25 m2 quadrats placed randomly. Seagrass percent cover was recorded at each site. The ¿visual estimates of biomass¿ technique when applied to free diving/helicopter/walking surveys involves ranking while referring to a series of quadrat photographs of similar seagrass habitats for which the above-ground biomass has been previously measured. The relative proportion of the above-ground biomass (percentage) of each seagrass species within each survey quadrat was also recorded. Field biomass ranks were converted into above-ground biomass estimates in grams dry weight per square metre (g DW m-2).\r\n\r\n\r\nChange Log:\r\n\r\nThis section will document changes to the dataset as subsequent versions are released. This section will allow you to tell if you have the latest copy of the dataset.\r\n\r\n- Version 1 (2016-06-09): Initial release of the dataset containing data from 1984 - 2014. The filenames for this release were: GBR_NESP-TWQ-3-1_JCU_Seagrass_1984-2014_Site-surveys and GBR_NESP-TWQ-3-1_JCU_Seagrass_1984-2014_Meadow-boundaries.\r\n\r\n\r\nFormat:\r\n\r\nAll survey data were entered into a Geographic Information System (GIS) using MapInfo (generally pre-2005) then ArcMap® software. MapInfo spatial data was converted to ArcMap shapefiles. Rectified colour satellite imagery of the region (Source: ESRI), field notes and aerial photographs taken from helicopter surveys were used to identify geographical features such as reef platforms, channels and deep-water drop-offs to assist in determining seagrass meadow boundaries. Two GIS layers - a Site layer and a Meadow layer - were created to describe seagrass. The projection used for these layers is GDA94.\r\n\r\nShape filenames:\r\n* GBR_NESP-TWQ-3-1_JCU_Seagrass_1984-2014_Site-surveys.shp  (Site surveys)\r\n* GBR_NESP-TWQ-3-1_JCU_Seagrass_1984-2014_Meadow-boundaries.shp (Meadow boundaries)\r\n\r\n\r\nData Dictionary:\r\n\r\nSeagrass site Data:\r\n\r\n1.

Data custodians:\r\n- DATA_CUSTO: Data custodians\r\n\r\n\r\nSeagrass meadow data:\r\n\r\n- NRM_REGION: The NRM region in which the survey occurred.\r\n- SURVEY_DAT: Survey month and year, or a list of survey dates for meadows repeatedly sampled.\r\n- METHOD: Sampling and mapping methods ¿ GPS/aerial photography, helicopter, walking, boat with camera, diver, grab and/or sled.\r\n- PERSISTENC: Meadows were classed according to four categories: Stable, Variable, Highly variable ephemeral, or Unknown.\r\n- MEADOW_LOC: Meadows were classed according to three categories, although some meadows cover a range of these locations: Intertidal, Shallow subtidal, or Deep subtidal.\r\n- DENSITY: Meadow density categories (light, dense, variable among years, unknown) were determined by the consistency of mean above-ground biomass of the dominant species among all years sampled.\r\n- DOMINANT_S: Dominant species and species present.\r\n- SPP_PRESEN: All species present.\r\n- MEAN_BIOMA: Mean meadow biomass in g DW m-2 (+ standard error if available), or the minimum and maximum biomass recorded for meadows sampled more than once.\r\n- AREA_HA: Meadow area in hectares (+ reliability estimate if available), or the minimum and maximum area recorded for meadows sampled more than once.\r\n- HECTARES: Total extent of meadow (HA)\r\n- PERCENT_CO: Meadow percent cover - this value represents mean seagrass percent cover, or the range of percent cover (if >1 number in the data cell). Meadow percent cover was most commonly calculated in pre-1990s surveys and recorded as ¿n/a¿ if not available.\r\n- CUSTODIAN: Data custodians\r\n- COMMENTS\r\n\r\nMeadow Persistence:\r\n- Stable: enduring meadow form; seagrass presence, biomass and area expected to be stable over time and seagrass meadow expected to be a permanent feature apart from extreme events or sustained long term impacts;\r\n- Variable: meadow presence, biomass and area expected to fluctuate within and among years, but generally some seagrass expected to be present apart from extreme events or sustained long term impacts;\r\n- Highly variable ephemeral: meadow not persistent over time; at some time periods seagrass will be present and at other times absent. Ephemeral meadows that have a naturally extreme level of variation in area and biomass within and among years; \r\n- Unknown: undetermined persistence as meadow sampled only once.\r\n\r\nMeadow Location:\r\n- Intertidal - all sites surveyed by helicopter or walking within a meadow and/or comments in field books identified an intertidal meadow, \r\n- Shallow subtidal - meadows where free divers SCUBA, sled collection, or cameras were used to sample and water depth was generally <10 m;\r\n- Deep subtidal - for this project meadows >10 m deep were included as deep subtidal.\r\n\r\n\r\nLimitations:\r\n\r\nSpatial limits:\r\nSeagrass data north and south of the GBRWHA were excluded from the layers but are available on request. Data were included when sites and meadows extended west of the GBRWHA boundary into coastal and estuarine water immediately adjacent. In shallow coastal waters seagrass meadows have been mapped and estimates of meadow boundaries are provided in the meadow GIS layer. For deeper water seagrass information is provided as data points in the site layer. Modelled distributions are available (Coles et al 2009; Pitcher et al 2007) but not included here. \r\n\r\nData limitations:\r\nData included extends back to the mid-1980s. Large parts of the coast have not been mapped for seagrass presence since that time. Technology and methods for mapping and position fixing have improved dramatically in 30 years. Early data included here has been re-checked and re-entered on several occasions and previously included in other spatial platforms (see McKenzie et al 2014). The layers included in this report represent the most reliable interpretation of that early data. \r\n\r\nTaxonomy:\r\nSeagrass taxonomy has changed through time, with species such as Halophila ovata no longer recognised and some doubts expressed about other species whose morphology is relatively plastic. Field surveys have at times grouped species that are difficult to distinguish outside a laboratory. To address these issues we have amalgamated some species into complexes: Halophila ovata, Halophila minor, Halophila colesi/australis and Halophila ovalis are included as Halophila. ovalis. Halodule pinifolia is grouped with Halodule. uninervis. Data collected in winter may underestimate the extent of ephemeral species such as Halophila decipiens and Halophila tricostata. This is important if this composite is used to compare annual changes. Zostera muelleri subsp. capricorni has been abbreviated to Zostera capricorni throughout.\r\n\r\nWarranty:\r\nTropWATER gives no warranty in relation to the data (including accuracy, reliability, completeness, currency or suitability) and accepts no liability (including without limitation, liability in negligence) for any loss, damage or costs (including consequential damage) relating to any use of the data. TropWATER reserves the right to update, modify or correct the data at any time. The limitations of some older data included need to be understood and recognised. The TropWATER Seagrass Group would appreciate the opportunity to review documents providing research, management, legislative or compliance advice based on this data.\r\n\r\n\r\nReferences:\r\n\r\nBirch, W.

These being Remnant and Non-remnant vegetation. Remnant vegetation is further split into regional ecosystems, whilst non-remnant is split into eight.\n<ul>\n<li>Canal - man-made.</li>\n<li>Disturbed - predominantly thinned vegetation that no longer meets criteria for remnant vegetation on the basis of canopy cover.</li>\n<li>Exotic - vegetation dominated by exotic species.</li>\n<li>Native plantation e.g. Eucalyptus spp., mixed native cabinet timber species.</li>\n<li>Plantation - predominantly pine plantation (Pinus spp.) and hoop/bunya pine.</li>\n<li>Regrowth - vegetation that has been cleared and has regrown but still does not meet the criteria for remnant vegetation.</li>\n<li>Rehabilitation area - actively managed e.g. 2 Million Trees area.</li>\n<li>Water - anthropogenic water bodies.</li>\n</ul>\n\nThis dataset was derived from the Queensland Herbarium dataset Regional Ecosystems 2015.",

    "description": "This collection consists of the model set-up used to develop an initial capability for modelling biological nitrification inhibition (BNI) in APSIM Next Generation and a preliminary evaluation of BNI in wheat, canola, sorghum and maize systems across Australian grain regions. To generate the data, an extensive literature review of BNI was undertaken. Based on the available evidence, an APSIM-BNI module was developed using APSIM Manager script and integrated into APSIM. The APSIM-BNI module was evaluated for model sensibility, parameter sensitivity and uncertainty. The developed APSIM-BNI module was then used in a scenario analysis to quantify the plausible impact of BNI on both productivity and emissions from Australian farming systems. This collection includes APSIMX file with BNI manager script, simulation output in csv formats. The output variables reported either daily, seasonal or annual include soil carbon, soil mineral nitrogen, nitrogen loss pathways, soil water, crop biomass, N uptake yield, and gross margins.  ",

The paper examines trends in criminal offences and family violence incidents to 30 June 2020, focusing on comparing the period from 1 April 2020 to 30 June 2020 with the same period in 2019.\nThis paper aims to examine whether and how the COVID-19 pandemic, associated behaviour changes and implemented restrictions impacted on crime in Victoria. It examines whether there were changes in the volume, nature or location of offending recorded by police following the introduction of restrictions in late March 2020 and provides an overview of offences recorded for breaching restrictions introduced to address COVID-19.

    "description": "This dataset presents the footprint of the number of installations of small generation unit (SGU) solar panel systems and their rated output in kilowatts (kW). The data spans the months of 2014 and includes the total for the year. The data is aggregated to Postal Areas (POAs) from the 2016 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nEvery month the Clean Energy Regulator (CER) publishes small-scale renewable energy installation data files. These data files provide a list of SGU (small-scale solar panel, wind and hydro systems) and kW capacity by installed postcode, and solar water heaters (SWH) and air source heat pumps by installed postcode. The data represents all systems that have had certificates validly created against them. The data includes new installations, upgrades to existing systems and stand-alone (off-grid) systems. This data is not publicly available via the Renewable Energy Certificate (REC) Registry and does not include systems that are pending registration or have been failed by the CER.\nFor further information about this dataset, visit the data source:Clean Energy Regulator - Postcode Data for Small-scale Installations.\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data by joining the data with the 2016 ASGS POAs\n\n\nThe data is current as at 30-09-2018.\n\n\nRenewable Energy Target (RET) legislation allows a 12 month creation period for registered persons to create their certificates.\n\n\nSmall-scale technology certificates are calculated based on the life of the system. This differs for solar hot water heaters and small generation units (solar panels, wind and hydro). Further information can be found at theRenewable Energy Target FAQ.\n\n\nCapacity data has been revised to account for past data entry errors which caused significant inconsistencies. These systems were installed between 2001 and 2003. As a result of this revision, the cumulative installed capacity from 2004 onwards has reduced by 5.517MW.\n\n",

    "description": "This dataset presents the footprint of the percentage of adults who felt their GP always or often showed respect for what they had to say in the preceding 12 months. The data spans the years of 2014-2017 and is aggregated to 2015 Department of Health Primary Health Network (PHN) areas, based on the 2011 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nThe data is sourced from the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) 2016-17 Patient Experience Survey, collected between 1 July 2016 and 30 June 2017. It also includes data from previous Patient Experience Surveys conducted in 2013-14, 2014-15 and 2015-16. The Patient Experience Survey is conducted annually by the ABS and collects information from a representative sample of the Australian population. The Patient Experience Survey is one of several components of the Multipurpose Household Survey, as a supplement to the monthly Labour Force Survey. The Patient Experience Survey collects data on persons aged 15 years and over, who are referred to as adults for this data collection.\nFor further information about this dataset, visit the data source:Australian Institute of Health and Welfare - Patient experiences in Australia Data Tables.\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data using the Department of Health - PHN Areas.\n\n\nPercentages are calculated based on counts that have been randomly adjusted by the ABS to avoid the release of confidential data.\n\n\nAs an indication of the accuracy of estimates, 95% confidence intervals were produced. These were calculated by the ABS using standard error estimates of the proportion.\n\n\nSome of the patient experience measures for 2016-17 have age-standardised rates presented. Age-standardised rates are hypothetical rates that would have been observed if the populations studied had the same age distribution as the standard population.\n\n\nCrude rates are provided for all years. They should be used for understanding the patterns of actual service use or level of experience in a particular PHN.\n\n\nThe Patient Experience Survey excludes persons aged less than 15 years, persons living in non-private dwellings and the Indigenous Community Strata (encompassing discrete Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities).\n\n\nData for Northern Territory should be interpreted with caution as the Patient Experience Survey excluded the Indigenous Community Strata, which comprises around 25% of the estimated resident population of the Northern Territory living in private dwellings.\n\n\nRows that contain a \"#\" in \"Interpret with Caution\" indicates that the estimate has a relative standard error of 25% to 50%, which indicates a high level of sampling error relative to its value and must be taken into account when comparing this estimate with other values.\n\n\nNP - Not available for publication. The estimate is considered to be unreliable. Values assigned to NP in the original data have been set to null.\n\n",

    "description": "This dataset presents the footprint of participation statistics in the National Bowel Cancer Screening Program (NBCSP) for people aged 50 to 74. The NBCSP began in 2006. It aims to reduce morbidity and mortality from bowel cancer by actively recruiting and screening the eligible target population for early detection or prevention of the disease. The data spans the years of 2015-2017 and is aggregated to Statistical Area Level 2 (SA2) geographic areas from the 2011 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nCancer is one of the leading causes of illness and death in Australia. Cancer screening programs aim to reduce the impact of selected cancers by facilitating early detection, intervention and treatment. Australia has three cancer screening programs:\n\n\nBreastScreen Australia\n\n\nNational Cervical Screening Program (NCSP)\n\n\nNational Bowel Cancer Screening Program (NBCSP)\n\n\nThe National cancer screening programs participation data presents the latest cancer screening participation rates and trends for Australia's 3 national cancer screening programs. The data has been sourced from the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare (AIHW) analysis of National Bowel Cancer Screening Program register data, state and territory BreastScreen Australia register data and state and territory cervical screening register data.\nFor further information about this dataset, visit the data source:Australian Institute of Health and Welfare - National Cancer Screening Programs Participation Data Tables.\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data.\n\n\nParticipation rates represent the percentage of people invited to screen through the NBCSP during the relevant 2-year period, who returned a completed screening test within that period or by 30 June of the following year. The number of individuals invited to screen excludes those who deferred or opted out without completing their screening test.\n\n\nValues assigned to n.p. in the original data have been set to null.\n\n\nSA2 areas were assigned to NBCSP invitees using an SA1 to SA2 correspondence. Those invitees without reliable SA1 details were mapped with a postcode to SA2 correspondences instead, which may lead to some minor inaccuracies in results.\n\n\nSome invitee SA1 codes and postcodes cannot be attributed to an SA2. These invitees were included in an 'Unknown' group where applicable.\n\n\nSome postcodes cross SA2 boundaries, leading to slight inaccuracies.\n\n\nBiennial screening for those aged 50-74 is not fully rolled out. During the time period reported, the specific ages invited within the 50-74 age range included 50, 54, 55, 58, 60, 64, 65, 68, 70, 72 and 74.\n\n\nThese results calculate participation rates using the new NBCSP performance indicator specifications. This indicator now measures a 2-year invitation period and also excludes those who opted off or suspended participation. Therefore, these results cannot be compared to rates reported prior to 2014.\n\n\nNBCSP participation rates per area are not related to bowel cancer incidence rates.\n\n\nSA2 areas with a numerator less than 20 or a denominator less than 100 have been suppressed. SA2 data for the Blue Mountains - South, Christmas Island, Cocos (Keeling) Islands, Illawarra Catchment Reserve, Jervis Bay and Lord Howe Island were suppressed due to reliability concerns from low numbers in these regions.\n\n\nThe 2015-2016 period covers 1 January 2015 to 31 December 2016, and the 2016-2017 period covers 1 January 2016 to 31 December 2017.\n\n\nParticipation by SA2 is not available for the period 2014-2015.\n\n\nThe number of people in different SA2s may not sum to 'Australia' total due to rounding.\n\n",

    "description": "The NSW SPOT 2025  imagery product is a state-wide satellite dataset for NSW Government. The SPOT 2025 satellite data acquisition period was from December 2024 to May 2025. The imagery scenes used to create the NSW mosaic includes Lord Howe Island. This imagery data set has been acquired through GeoImage Pty Ltd and Airbus Defence and Space.\n\nSPOT satellites offer high resolution imaging over broad areas in a single pass at resolutions up to 1.5m. Such precise coverage is ideal for applications at national and regional scales from 1:250,000 to 1:15,000. SPOT 6 also includes the benefits of the near-infrared (NIR) which enables applications for detection of features not visible to the human eye, such as detecting and monitoring vegetation health.\n\nData products supplied for all of NSW are:\n<ol>\n<li>\n\n<strong>State-wide mosaic High Definition 75cm resolution (GDA2020)</strong>\n</li>\n<li>\n\nState-wide mosaic 1.5m resolution (WGS84 and GDA2020/NSW Lambert) \n</li>\n<li>\n\n100k Mapsheet tiles (GDA2020)\n</li>\n<li>\n\nMulti spectral scenes (GDA94 and GDA2020)\n</li>\n<li>\n\nPan sharpened scenes (GDA94 and GDA2020)\n</li>\n<li>\n\nPanchromatic scenes (GDA94 and GDA2020)\n</li>\n<li>\n\nShapefile cutlines of statewide mosaic (WGS 84 and GDA2020)\n</li>\n</ol>\n\nThe statewide mosaic comes with RGB enhancements with 1:10 compression of the pansharpened imagery in ECW  (63GB) and JP2000 (84GB) format. Individual 100k mapsheet mosaics contain RGB+NIR band combination; unenhanced 16-bit GeoTIFF format tile.\n\nThe NSW mosaic is available from internal DCCEEW APOLLO Image Webserver for DCCEEW employees.\n\nThe 4band 100k mapsheet tiles are available for download from JDAP(pending).\nThe rectified multispectral, pan sharpened and panchromatic scenes are available for download from JDAP (pending)\n\nAcknowledgement when referencing: includes material © Airbus DS 2025\n\nContact spatial.imagery@environment.nsw.gov.au for further information or to request access to the imagery or JDAP \n\n<strong>These image products are only available to other NSW Government agencies upon request.</strong>",

    "description": "This data set provides fixed broadband network performance, allocated to zoom level 16 web mercator tiles (approximately 610.8 meters by 610.8 meters at the equator). Download speed, upload speed, and latency are collected via the Speedtest by Ookla applications for Android and iOS and averaged for each tile. Measurements are filtered to results containing GPS-quality location accuracy.\nFor more information please see the Ookla Github repository or the Registry of Open Data on AWS.\nOokla licenses data to NGOs and educational institutions to fulfill its mission: to help make the internet better, faster and more accessible for everyone. Ookla hopes to further this mission by distributing the data to make it easier for individuals and organizations to use it for the purposes of bridging the social and economic gaps between those with and without modern Internet access.\nAURIN has generated a subset corresponding to the intersection with the extent of Australia. It was then reprojected from EPSG 4326 (WGS84) to 4283 (GDA94).",

    "description": "The data contains the indicative distributions of threatened ecological communities, population and species, maintained in the BioNet Threatened Biodiversity Profiles data collection.  \n\nThe base geometry is IBRA subregions (Interim Bio-Regional of Australia). For each threatened entity, a 'known' or 'predicted' occurrence value is attributed against the individual IBRA subregions that form the species distribution.\n\nAttribution of 'Known' occurrence for an IBRA subregion is based on the existence of at least one valid observation record with a spatial accuracy of better than 10km. 'Predicted' occurrence contain no validated records where the spatial accuracy is better than 10km. The assignment is based on expert knowledge and is generally not assisted by distribution modelling approaches. For species and populations, validation of the underlying species records are managed by the Threatened Species Accountable Officer within the NSW Department of Climate Change, Energy, the Environment and Water. \n\nThe data are rendered live from BioNet Atlas to the Threatened Biodiversity Profiles web app https://threatenedspecies.bionet.nsw.gov.au/.\n\nThese distributions are pulled from the BioNet OData Web Service entity sets; ThreatenedBiodiversity_TECGeographicData, ThreatenedBiodiversity_TPGeographicData and ThreatenedBiodiversity_TSGeographicData. This data is available as spatial and non spatial (Excel power query) data.\n\nMetadata for each of the fields in the power query are contained in the data standard; https://www.environment.nsw.gov.au/publications/bionet-threatened-biodiversity-web-service-data-standard-version-1-2.\n\nNote the data are indicative only and should be used with care.",

    "description": "This dataset presents the footprint of the percentage of selected women who gave birth for the first time and who had labour induced. This has been calculated with the number of selected females who gave birth for the first time and who had labour induced, divided by all selected females, and multiplied by 100. The data spans the years of 2012-2016 and is aggregated to 2015 Department of Health Primary Health Network (PHN) areas, based on the 2011 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nWomen included are those who gave birth for the first time and met all of the following criteria:\n\n\nAged between 20 and 34.\n\n\nGestational age at birth between 37 and 41 completed weeks.\n\n\nPregnancy has one baby only (singleton).\n\n\nThe presentation of the baby is vertex (baby's head was at the cervix).\n\n\nThe data is sourced from the National Perinatal Data Collection (NPDC), which is a national population-based cross-sectional collection of data on pregnancy and childbirth. The data are based on births reported to the perinatal data collection in each state and territory in Australia. Midwives and other birth attendants, using information obtained from mothers and from hospital or other records, complete notification forms for each birth. A standard de-identified extract is provided to the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare (AIHW) on an annual basis to form the NPDC.\nFor further information about this dataset, please visit:\n\n\nAustralian Institute of Health and Welfare - National Core Maternity Indicators Data Tables.\n\n\nMetadata Online Registry Entry.\n\n\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data using the Department of Health - PHN Areas.\n\n\nA birth is defined as an event in which a baby comes out of the uterus after a pregnancy of at least 20 weeks gestation or weighing 400 grams or more.\n\n\nInduction of labour is a set of procedures (pharmacological and/or instrumental) to start the uterus contracting and begin the process of labour.\n\n\nGestational age is a clinical measure of the duration of the pregnancy. For the NPDC gestational age is reported as completed weeks.\n\n\nData for selected women criteria, parity, were not available from Victoria for 2009.\n\n\nData for Tasmania from 2004 to 2012 were not available. For Tasmania from 2005 to 2012, presentations via caesarean births were not reported by hospitals still using paper-based form. Where a caesarean section occurred the presentation was recorded as ‘Not stated’. Presentations via caesarean births were included in the paper-based form from 1 January 2013. The year 2004 was not included in this analysis.\n\n\nThe sum of the reported 'Grouped by' values may not equal the Australia total.\n\n",

    "description": "**This is a superseded dataset, the most recent _Australia's Indigenous land and forest estate_ spatial dataset can be found at: https://www.agriculture.gov.au/abares/forestsaustralia/forest-data-maps-and-tools/spatial-data/indigenous-land-and-forest.**\r\n\r\nThe Australia's Indigenous land and forest estate (2020) is a continental spatial dataset that identifies and reports separately the individual attributes of Australia's Indigenous estate, namely the extent of land and forest over which Indigenous peoples and communities have ownership, management and co-management, or other special rights.\r\n\r\nThis dataset is the same as the previously published Australia's Indigenous forest estate (2020) (released 03 December 2020) but with an amended title that more accurately reflects the full extent of the dataset.\r\n\r\nIt was developed from multiple data sources, including national, state and territory datasets related to land in which there is an Indigenous interest. The Indigenous land dataset is then combined with forest cover information from the Forests of Australia (2018) dataset.\r\n\r\nThe dataset was compiled by the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics and Sciences (ABARES) for the National Forest Inventory (NFI), a collaborative partnership between the Australian and state and territory governments. The role of the NFI is to collate, integrate and communicate information on Australia's forests. The NFI applies a national classification to state and territory data to allow seamless integration of these datasets. Multiple independent sources of external data are used to fill data gaps and improve the quality of final datasets. The following attributes are applied in this dataset:\r\n\r\n* __Indigenous owned__: Freehold land or forest that is owned by Indigenous communities, or land and forest for which ownership is vested through other mechanisms.\r\n\r\n* __Indigenous managed__: Land or forest that is managed by Indigenous communities.\r\n\r\n* __Indigenous co-managed__: Land or forest that has formal, legally binding agreements in place to include input from Indigenous people in the process of developing and implementing a management plan.\r\n\r\n* __Other special rights__: Land or forest subject to native title determinations, registered Indigenous Land Use Agreements and legislated special cultural use provisions.\r\n\r\nIn this dataset, the attributes of Indigenous ownership, Indigenous management or co-management, and other special rights are applied separately. The dataset structure therefore differs from Indigenous estate datasets published by ABARES in 2018 or earlier.\r\n\r\n",

    "description": "The NSW Combined Drought Indicator (CDI) is used by the Department of Primary Industries and Regional Development (DPIRD) to classify drought in New South Wales. It integrates weather, climate, soil, and land-use datasets into a single framework to help decision making.\nThe CDI combines meteorological, hydrological and agronomic definitions of drought using indicators for rainfall (RI), soil water (SWI), and plant growth (PGI). From these, a fourth index, the Drought Direction Index (DDI), is developed. Used together, these indices classify the five categories of drought. By using multiple indicators, the CDI provides an overall indication of drought conditions in NSW. \nThe CDI is a long-term drought indicator which tracks events that are at least 9-12 months in duration. It is not overly sensitive to short term climatic events and for this reason can lag field conditions. \nFor more information on the CDI and its underlying indicators, see https://www.dpi.nsw.gov.au/climate_applications/interactive-drought-map/Learn-more/understanding-the-cdi-phases\nCDI online interactive map https://www.dpi.nsw.gov.au/climate_applications/interactive-drought-map\nDPIRD's interactive CDI map provides free access to current and historical drought information at the NSW parish level (~10-20 farms), while the underlying monitoring occurs at 1 square kilometre resolution (data provided by ANUClimate). The interactive map is updated daily and displays the latest (4 days lag) CDI and drought indicator values for NSW. \nTime series CDI and indicator data for up to 5 years before present for a particular location can be obtained by using the location search bar or by clicking on the LLS, LGA, then Parish of interest. Time series can be downloaded as figure files (.jpg).\nCDI data cannot be downloaded directly from the interactive map. For access to the data that is displayed on the map, please visit the Seasonal Conditions Information Portal (SCIP) https://edis.spaceport.intersect.org.au/\nThe Seasonal Conditions Information Portal provides access to monthly snapshots of CDI data in several forms:\nMonthly CDI and indicator GIS .zips containing .shp, .shx, .dbf, and .prj (2020 January to present),\nMonthly CDI and indicator .csv files (2020 January to present),\n    Monthly LGA percentages in drought .csv files (2016 January to present),\n    Weekly updating high-quality parish-level time series figures (.jpg) (2 years before present to present), and \n    Extended parish time series by decade (1970 – 2020).\nThe NSW State Seasonal Update https://www.dpi.nsw.gov.au/climate_applications/state-seasonal-update contains a verified version of CDI information released as monthly report and accompanying text.\nIncludes: statewide overviews of monthly indicators, including the CDI, rainfall, temperature, remotely-sensed vegetation and water availability Regional (Local Land Service) breakdowns of seasonal conditions Climate driver updates Seasonal forecasts of rainfall, temperature, and drought.\nNSW Drought in a Changing Climate Report: The NSW-CDI has also been utilised to assesses the longer term risk of future drought using CMIP6 climate projections to drive the EDIS system.  A report summarising the project and its results are available here https://www.dpi.nsw.gov.au/dpi/climate/seasonal-conditions-and-drought/key-research/drought-under-climate-change.\nAdditional data available by request by contacting seasonal.conditions@dpird.nsw.gov.au",

    "description": "We propose to continue undertake a pulsar survey along the Galactic Plane using the new Methanol Multibeam receiver in order to uncover pulsars previously selected against in lower frequency surveys. The scientific aims of this survey are\n(a) to discover young pulsars in the spiral arms, hidden at lower frequencies, (b) to improve our knowledge of the distribution of dispersing and scattering material, particularly in the inner Galaxy, (c) strike it lucky and discover unique objects (e.g. a pulsar with a black hole companion and short period binary pulsars) and\n(d) to survey the transient radio sky at high frequencies.",

    "description": "The lesser hairy-footed dunnart (<i>Sminthopsis youngsoni, Dasyuridae</i>) is a generalist marsupial insectivore in arid Australia, but consumes wolf spiders (<i>Lycosa spp., Lycosidae</i>) disproportionately often relative to their availability. This project tested the hypothesis that this disproportionate predation is a product of frequent encounter rates between the interactants due to high overlap in their diets and use of space and time. This data set focuses on the dietary aspect. Specifically, invertebrate pitfall trapping was employed to quantify food availability and selectivity for both wolf spiders and <i>S.youngsoni</i>. Pitfall traps were deployed along trails left by tracked individuals, as well as control trails, of both species groups in the north-western Simpson Desert, Queensland. In total, invertebrate pitfall traps were deployed along 11 <i>S.youngsoni</i> and 8 <i>lycosa</i> trails in October 2016. Invertebrates were identified to the level of \"Order\", except for spiders (Order: Arachnida) and bees, wasps and ants (Order: Hymenoptera) which were identified to the \"Family\" level using identification keys and were also counted and grouped into seven size classes. This data was used for the following analyses: [1] a two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) to test whether total numbers of arthropods differed between trail type and species, [2] non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) and [3] permutational analysis of variance (PERMANOVA) to test whether assemblages of arthropod prey and prey sizes differed between the two trail types for each species and between each species.",

The Buildings dataset has relationships with the G-NAF, Cadastre, Property and Administrative Boundaries products produced by Geoscape Australia. Users should note that these related Geoscape products are not part of Buildings.\nFor more information regarding Geoscape Buildings, please refer to the Data Product Description and the June 2022 Release Notes.\nPlease note: As per the licence for this data, the coverage area accessed by you can not be greater than a single Level 2 Statistical Area (SA2) as defined by the Australian Bureau of Statistics. If you require additional data beyond a single SA2 for your research, please request a quote from AURIN.\nBuildings is a digital dataset representing buildings across Australia. Data quality and potential capture timelines will vary across Australia based on two categories, each category has been developed based on a number of factors including the probability of the occurrence of natural events (e.g. flooding), population distribution and industrial/commercial activities. Areas with a population greater than 200, or with significant industrial/commercial activity in a visual assessment have been defined as 'Urban' and all other regions have been defined as 'Rural'. This dataset has been restricted to the Sydney - Haymarket - The Rocks SA2 by AURIN.",

    "description": "    \n\nMean annual (00) and monthly (01a|12) transpiration (mm) from the plant canopy\nfor the period 1980-1999.Interpretation:Canopy transpiration is far more\nspatially variable than potential evaporation, reflecting the effects of water\nlimitation in most areas of the continent. Both the annual mean and seasonal\npattern broadly resemble the corresponding patterns for rainfall. Canopy\ntranspiration maps have more acontrasta (relative variation) than the total\nevaporation or rainfall maps because transpiration is a small component of\ntotal evaporation in areas of low plant cover (the remainder being soil\nevaporation).The partitioning between soil evaporation and canopy\ntranspiration in the model is determined by leaf area index.Notes: These are\nmodel-based estimates from the BiosEquil model. Results are given for the\naBASEa (pre-1788) and aAGRICa (present day) conditions.

    "description": "*Fires in Australia’s Forests 2011–16 (2018)* is a continental spatial dataset\r\nof the extent and frequency of planned and unplanned fires occurring in\r\nforest in the five financial years between July 2011 and June 2016,\r\nassembled for *Australia's State of the Forests Report 2018*. It was\r\ndeveloped from multiple fire area datasets contributed by state and\r\nterritory government agencies, after consultation with Australia’s Forest\r\nFire Management Group. The fire dataset is then combined with forest\r\ncover information sourced from the *Forests of Australia (2018)* dataset: https://data.gov.au/data/dataset/forests-of-australia-2018, \r\nand forest tenure information sourced from the *Tenure of Australia’s\r\nForests (2018)* dataset: https://data.gov.au/data/dataset/tenure-of-australia-s-forests-2018\r\n\r\nThe dataset was compiled by the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and\r\nResource Economics and Sciences (ABARES) for the National Forest\r\nInventory (NFI), a collaborative partnership between the Australian and\r\nstate and territory governments. The role of the NFI is to collate, integrate\r\nand communicate information on Australia's forests. The NFI applies a\r\nnational classification to state and territory data to allow seamless\r\nintegration of these datasets. Multiple independent sources of external\r\ndata are used to fill data gaps and improve the quality of the final dataset.\r\n\r\nForest areas burnt by fire are allocated by the month of the fire to a\r\nfinancial year (July–June inclusive). Where more than one fire event\r\noccurs on any one hectare during a financial year, only the first fire is\r\nrecorded for that area in the financial year. Fires are also classified into\r\ntwo categories, planned and unplanned, based on the fire seasonality and\r\nadvice from state and territory agencies.\r\n\r\nThe *Fires in Australia’s forests 2011–16 (2018)* dataset is produced to fulfil\r\nrequirements of Australia's *National Forest Policy Statement* and the\r\n*Regional Forests Agreement Act 2002* (Cwth), and is used by the Australian\r\nGovernment for domestic and international reporting.\r\n\r\nThis dataset is provided as part of the five-yearly Australia's State of the Forests Report Series.

    "description": "Overview  \r\n The March edition of Agricultural commodities contains ABARES' latest outlook for Australia's key agricultural commodities to 2021-22. \r\n The outlook will be an important focal point at the conference and underpin many presentations delivered by ABARES speakers at the conference. \r\n The report provides updated commodity forecasts, as well as articles on the EU sheep meat industry; farm performance of broadacre and dairy farms; productivity in Australia's broadacre and dairy industries; and disaggregating farm performance by size. \r\n\r\nKey Issues \r\n Commodity forecasts  \r\n• The gross value of farm production is forecast to increase by 8.3 per cent to a record $63.8 billion in 2016-17 before easing by 3.9 per cent to a forecast $61.3 billion in 2017-18. Despite the forecast decline, the gross value of farm production in 2017-18 would be 17.3 per cent higher than the average of $52.3 billion over the five years to 2015-16 in nominal terms. \r\n• The gross value of livestock production is forecast to increase by around 4.4 per cent to $31.2 billion in 2017-18, following a forecast decrease of 2.6 per cent in 2016-17. If this forecast is realised, the gross value of livestock production in 2017-18 would be around 28 per cent higher than the average of $24.4 billion over the five years to 2015-16 in nominal terms. \r\n• The gross value of crop production is forecast to decrease by 11.3 per cent to $30 billion in 2017-18, after a forecast increase of 20.2 per cent in 2016-17. The decrease follows record production of wheat and barley in 2016-17, which resulted from favourable seasonal conditions during winter and spring. If this forecast is realised, the gross value of crop production in 2017-18 would be around 8 per cent higher than the average of $27.9 billion over the five years to 2015-16 in nominal terms. \r\n• In 2021-22 the gross value of farm production is projected to be around $59.6 billion (in 2016-17 dollars), 8.6 per cent higher than the average of $54.9 billion over the five years to 2015-16 (also in 2016-17 dollars). In 2021-22 the gross value of crop production is projected to be around $29.0 billion and the gross value of livestock production is projected to be around $30.6 billion (in 2016-17 dollars). \r\n• Export earnings from farm commodities are forecast to be around $48.7 billion in 2017-18, higher than the forecast $47.7 billion in 2016-17. \r\n• The agricultural commodities for which export earnings are forecast to rise in 2017-18 are beef and veal (up 1 per cent), wool (10 per cent), dairy products (11 per cent), sugar (10 per cent), cotton (35 per cent), wine (5 per cent), lamb (3 per cent), live feeder/slaughter cattle (4 per cent), rock lobster (6 per cent) and mutton (1 per cent). \r\n• Forecast increases in 2017-18 are expected to be partly offset by expected declines in export earnings for wheat (down 9 per cent), coarse grains (11 per cent), canola (6 per cent) and chickpeas (42 per cent). \r\n• In Australian dollar terms, export prices of wool, dairy products, sugar, wine, lamb, barley, canola, rock lobster and mutton are forecast to increase in 2017-18. Export prices for cotton and chickpeas are forecast to fall. Prices for beef and veal, wheat and live feeder/slaughter cattle are forecast to remain around the same as in 2016-17. \r\n• In 2021-22 the value of farm exports is projected to be around $46.6 billion (in 2016-17 dollars), 8 per cent higher than the average of $43.1 billion over the five years to 2015-16 in real terms. \r\n• The value of crop exports is projected to be $24.9 billion (in 2016-17 dollars) in 2021-22, 7 per cent higher than the average of $23.2 billion over the five years to 2015-16 in real terms. The value of livestock exports is projected to be $21.8 billion (in 2016-17 dollars) in 2021-22, 10 per cent higher than the average of $19.8 billion over the five years to 2015-16 in real terms. \r\n• Export earnings for fisheries products are forecast to increase by 2.3 per cent in 2017-18 to $1.5 billion, after decreasing by a forecast 3.4 per cent in 2016-17. \r\n\r\n Economic assumptions underlying this set of commodity forecasts  \r\n\r\n In preparing this set of agricultural commodity forecasts: • World economic growth is assumed to be 3.3 per cent in 2017 and 3.4 per cent in 2018. Growth is expected to rise further to around 3.5 per cent in 2019 before declining to 3.4 per cent in 2021 and 3.3 per cent in 2022. \r\n• Economic growth in Australia is assumed to average 2.8 per cent in 2017-18. Over the medium term to 2021-22, economic growth is assumed to average around 3 per cent. \r\n• The Australian dollar is assumed to average US73 cents in 2017-18, slightly lower than the forecast average of US75 cents in 2016-17. It is assumed to appreciate slightly over the medium term, reaching US74 cents towards 2021-22. \r\n\r\n Articles on agricultural issues  \r\n The EU sheep meat industry  \r\n• The European Union is one of the world's largest consumers of sheep meat. Imports are controlled by import quotas and prohibitive out-of-quota tariffs. \r\n• Australia is the second largest exporter to the European Union, behind New Zealand, although its allocated quota is just 8 per cent that of New Zealand's. \r\n• As a high value market for sheep meat, expanding sheep meat exports to the European Union would benefit the Australian industry. However, until the trade outcomes of Brexit are known, opportunities for Australian sheep meat exporters are uncertain. \r\n\r\n Farm performance: broadacre and dairy farms, 2014-15 to 2016-17  \r\n• In 2016-17 farm cash income for Australian broadacre farms is projected to average $216,000 a farm, the highest recorded in the past 20 years. \r\n• Record broadacre farm cash incomes this year are the result of near record winter grain production in most regions and good prices for beef cattle, sheep, lamb and wool. \r\n• Average farm cash income is projected to increase for broadacre farms in all states except Tasmania in 2016-17. \r\n• Farm cash income for dairy farms is projected to decline by 17 per cent nationally to an average of $105,000 a farm in 2016-17, reflecting lower average farmgate milk prices and reduced milk production. \r\n\r\n Productivity in Australia's broadacre and dairy industries  \r\n• From 1977-78 to 2014-15, productivity in the broadacre industries averaged 1.1 per cent a year as a result of declining input use (down 1 per cent a year) and modest output growth (up 0.1 per cent a year). \r\n• In the dairy industry, productivity growth averaged 1.5 per cent a year between 1978-79 and 2014-15. This reflected average annual growth of 1.3 per cent in output and an average annual decline of 0.2 per cent in input use. \r\n\r\n Disaggregating farm performance by size  \r\n• The largest 10 per cent of broadacre farms produced 46 per cent of total output, while the smallest 50 per cent of farms produced 12 per cent of total output. \r\n• The average rate of return, including capital appreciation, generated by the largest 10 per cent of broadacre farms was 8.2 per cent, while the smallest 10 per cent generated average returns of -2.8 per cent. \r\n• The largest 10 per cent of broadacre farms had the lowest average equity ratio of all farms (79 per cent), while the smallest 10 per cent of farms had the highest average equity ratio (97 per cent). \r\n",

Australian Unity and the Australian Centre on Quality of Life at Deakin University have conducted national bi-annual population surveys for the last ten years and created an index of perceived wellbeing for the Australian population, including the population of Melbourne. Both organisations support the Index being used and developed as a scientific tool and encourage investigations into the usefulness of the Index by others.\n\n\n\nCity of Melbourne annually collects data on the personal wellbeing, social connection, self-reported health, volunteering behaviour, food security, acceptance of diverse cultures; engagement in decision making and arts and cultural activities of residents in Melbourne Local Government Area.

The Census collects information on students and staff from all non-government establishments that have, as their major activity, the administration or provision of full-time primary, secondary and/or special education. \nFor further information about this dataset, please visit the Queensland Department of Education - Downloadable Data Files.\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled this data using the Queensland Department of Education - State and Non State School Listings 2012-2018.\n\n\nData is made available through a AURIN-QCIF-RIDL collaboration.\n\n\nFrom 2015, students enrolled at state schools are recorded against their age or ability appropriate year level as determined by their school.\n\n\nFrom 2015, Year 7 became the first year of secondary school in Queensland.\n\n\nA half cohort of Prep Year was introduced in 2007 to align with the shift in the compulsory school starting age from 2008. In 2017 the half cohort is in Year 10.\n\n\nThe school structure in this data is as at August 2017; historical data has been combined for schools which have been amalgamated. For this reason, schools which were created by an amalgamation may have enrolments for years prior to opening.\n\n\nThe number of schools in this data may differ from the school count cube because there are a small number of schools which do not have enrolments of their own; rather students from other schools attend these schools on an as needs basis. The Lady Cilento Children's Hospital School does not have enrolments of their own.\n\n",

    "description": "\nUpper Murrumbidgee Waterwatch engages the community in the environment through monitoring and caring for our catchments. We educate and raise awareness in schools and the community on issues concerning catchment health and we use data collected by volunteers to inform policy and on ground catchment management.\nUpper Murrumbidgee Waterwatch volunteers collect data on water quality, waterbug diversity and abundance, and riparian vegetation condition at over 200 sites in the catchment. To use these data to assess the health of our waterways and the broader catchment, sites are grouped into reaches (segments of waterways and/or related waterbodies) and the data are summarised and presented by reach. To ensure that data collected from a small number of sites can be considered representative of a reach, reaches consist of similar sections of waterway as defined by criteria including the size (magnitude / stream order), surrounding land uses, and underlying geology of the included waterways and waterbodies.\nThis dataset contains annual scores of the water quality, waterbug diversity and abundance, riparian vegetation condition and overall health of individual reaches (related waterbodies) in the Upper Murrumbidgee River catchment, 2015 - 2024. Scores are calculated from monthly water quality data collected by Upper Murrumbidgee Waterwatch volunteers, and waterbug and riparian vegetation assessments conducted by Waterwatch staff. Detailed methods can be found in the <a href=\"https://www.act.waterwatch.org.au/data/chip-reports\">Catchment Health Indicator Program (CHIP) reports </a>produced each year by Upper Murrumbidgee Waterwatch: <a href=\"https://www.act.waterwatch.org.au/data/chip-reports\">https://www.act.waterwatch.org.au/data/chip-reports</a>\nThe data are best viewed using the <a href=\"https://experience.arcgis.com/experience/bf04e20bd88b4896854d86007d94eea3\">Waterwatch interactive map and data dashboard</a>.",

    "title": "Catchment Scale Land Use of Australia - Update September 2017",
    "description": "##This dataset has been superseded. An updated version of this dataset is available from the ABARES website.\r\n\r\nThis dataset is a national compilation of catchment scale land use data for Australia (CLUM), as at September 2017. It replaces the Catchment Scale Land Use of Australia - Update May 2016 released in June 2016. It is a seamless raster dataset that combines land use data for all state and territory jurisdictions, compiled at a resolution of 50 metres by 50 metres. It has been compiled from vector land use datasets collected as part of state and territory mapping programs through the Australian Collaborative Land Use and Management Program (ACLUMP). Catchment scale land use data was produced by combining land tenure and other types of land use information, fine-scale satellite data and information collected in the field. The date of mapping (2003 to 2017) and scale of mapping (1:5 000 to 1:250 000) vary, reflecting the source data, capture date and scale. This information is provided in a supporting polygon dataset. \r\n\r\nThe following areas have been updated since the May 2016 version: Desert Channels and Mackay-Whitsundays natural resource management (NRM) regions in Queensland; the Adelaide and Mount Lofty Ranges NRM region in South Australia (extending into part of the Murray-Darling Basin NRM region); the state of New South Wales; the state of Victoria; the state of Tasmania; the state of Western Australia; and the Northern Territory. The capital city of Adelaide was also updated using 2016 mesh block information from the Australian Bureau of Statistics. This equates to over 585 million hectares or 76% of Australia, the largest update of catchment scale land use mapping to date. \r\n\r\nUsers should update any references or links to previous CLUM datasets in their databases. Users should also note that it is not possible to calculate land use change statistics between annual CLUM national compilations as not all regions are updated each year; land use mapping methodologies, precision, accuracy and source data (in particular satellite imagery) have improved over the years; and the land use classification has changed over time. In particular, the major differences between this September 2017 version and the May 2016 version are:\r\n\r\n* The September 2017 version has been mapped to version 8 of the Australian Land Use and Management (ALUM) Classification (released in October 2016)\r\n* Improvements to the Western Australia mapping including improved mapping of native forests, conservation areas, topographic features, horticulture and intensive animal production\r\n* Changes to the mapping of native and modified pastures in New South Wales\r\n* Changes to the mapping of dairies in Tasmania so that only the dairy infrastructure is mapped as dairies and the dairy pastures are mapped as modified pastures.\r\n\r\nIt is only possible to calculate change when earlier land use datasets have been revised and corrected to ensure that changes detected are real change and not an artefact of the mapping process. The Queensland Land Use Mapping Program (QLUMP) have done this on an NRM regions basis for Queensland and can be accessed at:\r\n\r\n* Data: Search the Queensland Spatial Catalogue (http://dds.information.qld.gov.au/dds/) for \"Land Use Mapping\"\r\n* Reports: https://www.qld.gov.au/environment/land/vegetation/mapping/qlump-reports.\r\n\r\nThe CLUM data shows a single dominant land use for a given area, based on the primary management objective of the land manager (as identified by state and territory agencies). As a seamless spatial dataset for Australia, it can be used to identify, map and analyse high level land use categories (such as irrigated horticulture and dryland cropping) and more specific land use categories such as grapes, cotton, cereals, sugar and tree fruits. These categories can be extracted or combined with other spatial datasets to provide new insights and analysis concerning land use in Australia. A complementary dataset Catchment Scale Land Use of Australia - Commodities - September 2017 provides commodity level mapping as a vector dataset. \r\n\r\nLand use is classified according to the Australian Land Use and Management (ALUM) Classification version 8, a three-tiered hierarchical structure. There are five primary classes, identified in order of increasing levels of intervention or potential impact on the natural landscape. Water is included separately as a sixth primary class. Primary and secondary levels relate to the principal land use. Tertiary classes may include additional information on commodity groups, specific commodities, land management practices or vegetation information. The primary, secondary and tertiary codes work together to provide increasing levels of detail about the land use. Land may be subject to a number of concurrent land uses. For example, while the main management objective of a multiple-use production forest may be timber production, it may also provide conservation, recreation, grazing and water catchment land uses. In these cases, production forestry is commonly identified in the ALUM code as the prime land use. \r\n\r\nThe operational scales of catchment scale mapping vary according to the intensity of land use activities and landscape context. Scales range from 1:5 000 and 1:25 000 for irrigated and peri-urban areas, to 1:100 000 for broadacre cropping regions and 1:250 000 for the semi-arid and arid pastoral zone. The date of mapping generally reflects the intensity of land use. The most current mapping occurs in intensive agricultural areas; older mapping generally occurs in the semi-arid and pastoral zones. \r\nThe primary classes of land use in the ALUM Classification are:\r\n \r\n1. Conservation and natural environments - land used primarily for conservation purposes, based on maintaining the essentially natural ecosystems present\r\n2. Production from relatively natural environments - land used mainly for primary production with limited change to the native vegetation\r\n3. Production from dryland agriculture and plantations - land used mainly for primary production based on dryland farming systems\r\n4. Production from irrigated agriculture and plantations - land used mostly for primary production based on irrigated farming\r\n5. Intensive uses - land subject to extensive modification, generally in association with closer residential settlement, commercial or industrial uses\r\n6. Water - water features (water is regarded as an essential aspect of the classification, even though it is primarily a land cover type, not a land use)\r\n\r\nThe Catchment Scale Land Use of Australia - Update September 2017 is a product of the Australian Collaborative Land Use and Management Program (ACLUMP). ACLUMP, of which ABARES is a partner, promotes the development of consistent information on land use and land management practices. This consortium of Australian, state and territory government partners is critical to providing nationally consistent land use mapping at both catchment and national scale, underpinned by common technical standards including an agreed national land use classification. ACLUMP provides a national land use data directory and the maintenance of land use datasets on Australian and state government data repositories.

    "description": "Flow cytometry data was collected in July 2011, in waters off South Australia. \n\nThe general purpose of the study is to be able to establish background knowledge on the ecosystem on the continental shelf of South Australia and the impact of upwelling/saline outflow events on microbial communities to ultimately develop a biogeochemical model of the region. Sampling was carried out during cruises conducted on board the RV Ngerin as part of the Southern Australian Integrated Marine System (SAIMOS). During each cruise, the physical, chemical and biological properties of the chlorophyll fluorescence maximum (FM) layer were investigated. Flow cytometry data has been collected for picophytoplankton, bacteria and viruses.\n\nSix main stations have been sampled over the course of the study, five are located on the 100 m isobath, i.e. RS (35.508S, 136.278E), B2 (35.418S, 136.148E), B3 (35.258S, 136.048E), B4 (35.168S, 135.418E) and B5 (35.008S, 135.198E), and one from an offshore station (B1; 36.188S, 136.178E) located southwest of Kangaroo Island. Note that combining the distances between stations (14–25 nautical miles), the average component of the current velocity at middepth along the shelf (0.01 m s21) and the average speed of the vessel (i.e. 9 knots) indicate that different water masses were sampled at each station. Additional samples have on occasion been collected from the National Reference Station (NRS) at Kangaroo Island (35.832S, 136.447E) and the SA Spencer Gulf Mouth Mooring (SAM8SG, 35.25S, 136.690E), where the saline outflow occurs.",

The other HF ocean radar station is at Fremantle.  The HF ocean radar coverage is from the coast to beyond the edge of the continental shelf. \n\nThe GUI HF ocean radar is a WERA phased array system with a 16-element receive array.  This radar operates at a frequency of 8.512 MHz, with a bandwidth of 33 KHz, a maximum range of 200 Km and a range resolution of 4.5 Km.  Azimuthally the radar covers a sweep 60 deg either side of a bore sight direction of 230 deg true east of north (approximately south-west).\n\nWithin the HF radar coverage area surface current radials are measured.  Data are also collected from which wind directions and significant wave height can be calculated.",

The lightest 18O value (-2.99ppt) is recorded during the Holocene (~5cm depth) while the LGM (~125cm depth) is positioned at the heaviest 18O value of -0.59ppt. Once the estimated ice volume effect has been accounted for, this still leaves a substantial difference in 18O which must be accounted for through significant changes in sea-surface temperature (SST) or salinity. The 13C record ranges from a minimum at approximately 8500 yrs BP of 0.16ppt to a maximum value of 1.31ppt during MIS 3.",

Data were processed using PyFluxPro (v3.4.15) as described by Isaac et al. (2017). PyFluxPro produces a final, gap-filled product with Net Ecosystem Exchange (NEE) partitioned into Gross Primary Productivity (GPP) and Ecosystem Respiration (ER). \n\nThe site is classified as an open woodland savanna. The overstory is co-dominated by tree species <em>Eucalyptus miniata</em> and <em>Eucalyptus tentrodonata</em>, and average tree height is 14-16&nbsp;m. Elevation of the site is close to 64&nbsp;m and mean annual precipitation is 1750&nbsp;mm. Maximum temperatures range from 30.4&nbsp;°C (in July) to 33.2&nbsp;°C (in November), while minimum temperatures range from 19.3&nbsp;°C (in July) to 25.4&nbsp;°C (in November). Therefore, the maximum and minimum range varies from 7&nbsp;°C (wet season) to 11&nbsp;°C (dry season).\n\nThe instrument mast is 23&nbsp;m tall. Heat, water vapour and carbon dioxide measurements are taken using the open-path eddy flux technique. Temperature, humidity, wind speed, wind direction, rainfall, incoming and reflected shortwave radiation and net radiation are measured above the canopy. Soil heat fluxes are measured and soil moisture content is gathered using time domain reflectometry.",

The other HF ocean radar station is at North Nambucca.  \n\nThe RRK HF ocean radar is a WERA phased array system with a 16-element receive array.  This radar operates at a frequency of 13.912 MHz, with a bandwidth of 100 KHz, a maximum range of 100 Km and a range resolution of 1.5 Km.  Azimuthally the radar covers a sweep 60 deg either side of a bore sight direction of 285 deg true east of north (approximately west by north-west).\n\nWithin the HF radar coverage area surface current radials are measured.  Data are also collected from which wind directions and significant wave height can be calculated.",

    "description": "All government primary and secondary schools, including Prep/Foundation to Year 9 and multi-campus schools have school zones. This does not include schools with specific enrolment criteria including English Language Schools and Select Entry Schools. Specialist schools also do not have school zones and have special enrolment criteria.\nDesignated neighbourhood schools are generally the public school within closest proximity to the student’s permanent residential address, unless the Minister for Education or Regional Director has restricted the zone of the school. Closest proximity is calculated as the nearest school by straight line distance in metropolitan areas (including Geelong, Ballarat and Bendigo), or the nearest school by shortest practical route (in regional areas).\nSchool zones were produced in GDA94 VicGrid projection (EPSG: 3111) using locations that represent the front of the school or driveway access. Voronoi polygons define the measure of straight-line distance and calculations using road classes 0 to 7 in the VicMap Roads dataset were used to define the measure of shortest practical route. \nSchool zones defined as metropolitan have taken preference over school zones of regional schools where they interface. A small number of school zones have been restricted by the Minister for Education to support schools in managing their enrolments. Some school zones have been aligned with structural and geographic barriers recognising the significant accessibility issues they impose.\nSchool zones are reviewed annually and updated as government school provision changes. The school zones ZIP file consists of distinct spatial datasets for primary school zones and school zones for each year of secondary school, acknowledging the different year levels offered by schools. The spatial datasets can be used in conjunction with the school locations CSV file also available on data.vic.gov.au. School zones have been published on the findmyschool.vic.gov.au website.\nThe Victorian government school zones are intended to be relied on by parents and families for the purposes of making enrolment decisions for their children. They should not be relied on for making property purchase decisions, or by any party other than parents and families seeking to enrol their child in a government school.",

These moorings comprise the Indonesian Throughflow array, which was deployed in June 2011. This is an important first step in the enhanced monitoring of northern Australian waters.  These shelf moorings complement the three deep-water moorings deployed in the Timor Passage and Ombai Strait to monitor inter-basin Indian-Pacific Ocean exchange.\n\nProcessed data from the first two deployments (Jun 2010 and Jan 2011) are now available.",

The Gate point layer is only indicative for locked gates and the information is not always kept up to date therefore regard all gates as locked for safety reasons.\n\nThe Assets Geodatabase is directly related to the Assets Maintenance System (AMS) which runs under SAP and contains similar fields, values and business rules. The Assets Geodatabase is the vehicle in which spatial assets are initially captured, edited and stored so that the features have coordinates and can be viewed spatially.   The data is collected across the entire NSW National Parks Estate and includes some off-park features for fire management, access and mapping purposes.  The spatial feature data is manually synchronised with the AMS.  The two systems run side by side and are linked by an ID field.  AMS is also set up to be used by other OEH Divisions eg. Botanic Gardens and Parklands and previously Marine Parks.\n\nThe database includes the following asset Feature Class types - Barrier, Bridge or Elevated Walkway, Building, Communication Equipment, Crossing, Drainage Point, Environmental Monitoring Station, Extractive industry, Facility, Fence Handrail, Fire Management Zone, Gate, Hydraulic Point, Hydraulic Storage Point, Hydraulic Valve, Irrigation System, Landing, Landing Strip, Lookout, Natural Feature, Other Structure, Parking Area, Pipe Channel Section, Power or Communication line, Power or Communication point, Sign, Step point, Stormwater Drainage Line, Surface, Survey Mark, Tower, Track Section, Treatment Disposal System, Visitor Area, Visitor Monitoring Point.\nDetailed documentation is available including:\n-  Data Dictionary (internal location - P:\\Corporate\\Tools\\Information\\Assets)\n-  Data Model\n-  Business Rules\n-  Functional Location and Naming Convention\n\nNote that for external supply the dataset is simplified with certain attribute fields being removed.  Those fields that have a name prefixed with \"d_\" contain descriptions extracted from the original geodatabase domains.",

Council monitors the water quality at 11 sites in the Brisbane River and sections of Moreton Bay, which have high rates of recreational use. The datasets derived from the monitoring are published and warning signs are put in place where required.\n\nInformation on water quality monitoring can be found on the <a href=\"https://www.brisbane.qld.gov.au/environment-and-water/water-and-air-quality/water-quality-monitoring\">Brisbane City Council website</a>.\n\nThis dataset consists of the level of microbial contamination within Brisbane River and Moreton Bay. Brisbane City Council monitors of enterococci bi-monthly in summer and monthly during the cooler winter months. The presence of high levels of enterococci can vary daily, and may be elevated after heavy rainfall. Enterococci exposure can contribute to increased health risk and primary contact should be avoided.\n\nThe Data and resources section of this dataset contains further information for this dataset.",

    "title": "Lessons from the water market: The southern Murray-Darling Basin water allocation market 2000-01 to 2015-16",
    "description": "ABARES Lessons from the water market report analyses trends in water allocation prices in the southern Murray-Darling Basin (sMDB), between 2000-01 and 2015-16. This report analyses the major demand and supply side drivers of water allocation prices in the sMDB, drawing on historical data for 2000-01 to 2015-16. The study disentangles the effects of climate variability (rainfall, water storage and allocation volumes) from the key policy changes (including Commonwealth purchase of entitlements for the environment) and irrigation sector changes that have occurred during the period. \r\n\r\nKey Issues • The main driver of change in water prices over this period has been variation in rainfall, storages and allocations. During the peak of the drought water prices jumped to more than $1 000 per ML, before dropping to near zero during the flood years (2010-11 and 2011-12). Between 2011-12 and 2015-16, storage volumes steadily decreased and prices steadily increased. \r\n• However, ABARES finds that even after controlling for these dry conditions, market prices during 2014-15 and 2015-16 were higher than expected from past experience. The report finds that these higher prices can be explained by a combination of demand and supply factors including: Commonwealth entitlement purchases, state carryover rule changes, interregional trade restrictions and commodity price fluctuations and irrigation land-use changes. \r\n• While Commonwealth entitlement purchases reduce the supply of water and have an upward effect on prices, these are offset to some extent by Commonwealth investments in water saving infrastructure. Further, even if water savings are ignored, Commonwealth entitlement purchases offer only a partial explanation for the increase in water prices. \r\n• Another important factor has been changes to carryover rules particularly in Victoria, which have led to large increases in carryover volumes since 2007-08. This increase carryover since 2007-08 has contributed to higher allocation prices in the market. Despite this, carryover remains a positive development that will benefit irrigators in the long run by keeping prices lower in drought years. \r\n",
