    "description": "Export DataAccess APIThe Track Section Feature Class sits within the National Parks and Wildlife Service (NPWS) Assets Geodatabase. The Track Section line layer not only includes Walking Routes and Walking Tracks but also Aboriginal Travel Routes, Footpaths, Track Continuity Lines, and Specified Use Tracks.The Assets Geodatabase is directly related to the Assets Maintenance System (AMS) which runs under SAP and contains similar fields, values and business rules. The Assets Geodatabase is the vehicle in which spatial assets are initially captured, edited and stored so that the features have coordinates and can be viewed spatially. The data is collected across the entire NSW National Parks Estate and includes some off-park features for fire management, access and mapping purposes. The spatial feature data is manually synchronised with the AMS. The two systems run side by side and are linked by an ID field. AMS is also set up to be used by other OEH Divisions eg. Botanic Gardens and Parklands and previously Marine Parks.The database includes the following asset Feature Class types - Barrier, Bridge or Elevated Walkway, Building, Communication Equipment, Crossing, Drainage Point, Environmental Monitoring Station, Extractive industry, Facility, Fence Handrail, Fire Management Zone, Gate, Hydraulic Point, Hydraulic Storage Point, Hydraulic Valve, Irrigation System, Landing, Landing Strip, Lookout, Natural Feature, Other Structure, Parking Area, Pipe Channel Section, Power or Communication line, Power or Communication point, Sign, Step point, Stormwater Drainage Line, Surface, Survey Mark, Tower, Track Section, Treatment Disposal System, Visitor Area, Visitor Monitoring Point. Detailed documentation is available including: - Data Dictionary (internal location - P:\\Corporate\\Tools\\Information\\Assets) - Data Model - Business Rules - Functional Location and Naming ConventionNote that for external supply the dataset is simplified with certain attribute fields being removed.

    "description": "A large collection of photographs taken by photographer, Richard Woldendorp, including a wide variety of images of people, buildings, places, industries, sport and entertainment in Western Australia.The photographs were taken between 1958 - 2006.  The images can be accessed via the urls provided in the data.\r\n\r\nRichard Woldendorp was born in Utrecht, The Netherlands in 1927 and migrated to Perth in 1951. His long association with photography began in 1955 when he purchased a camera for a trip back to The Netherlands. Woldendorp's fascination with photography and skill rapidly grew and in 1961 won first and third prizes in the Craven-A National Photographic competition. As a professional photographer Woldendorp was intrigued by Australia's landscapes with a special passion for aerial photography. In 1991 Woldendorp was made a Fellow of the Australian Institute of Professional Photography, then in 1998 was admitted as a Honorary Life Member to the Australian Commerical and Media Photographers (A.C.M.P.), then to the A.C.M.P. Hall of Fame. In 2004 Richard Woldendorp was named a Western Australian Living Treasure.  ",

    "description": "The South-East Queensland 200m mooring (IMOS platform code SEQ200) is part of the East Australian Current (EAC) array. It was initially deployed on the 25/03/2012 at (27.34 S, 153.77 E). The site depth is 200m.\n\nObservations of currents, temperature, and conductivity are measured.\n\nIn conjunction with the SEQ400 mooring and the North Stradbroke Island National Reference Station (NRS NSI), this mooring forms the inshore component of the the EAC mooring array. The East Australian Current (EAC) is the major western boundary current of the south Pacific Ocean. It plays a critical role in the ocean re-distribution of global heat from the equator to the midand- high latitudes. The EAC is relatively stable north of Brisbane, but as the current moves south 2-3 large eddies are pinched off every year. These eddies frequently move onto the continental shelf and close inshore and influence the local circulation patterns. At prominent coastal features the EAC moves away from the coast, driving upwelling which draws nutrient-rich water from a depth of 200m or more. \n\nManagement of this mooring is undertaken by staff from the National Reference Station (North Stradbroke and Maria Island).",

    "description": "The operational map for Montane Peatlands and Swamps was constructed to resolve long-standing issues surrounding its identification, location and extent within the NSW State Forest estate covered by the eastern Regional Forest Agreements. \nThe project’s Threatened Ecological Community (TEC) Reference Panel (the Panel) reviewed the determination for Montane Peatlands and Swamps and agreed upon a set of diagnostic parameters for its identification through aerial photograph interpretation (API). These parameters included an elevation of greater than 400m and, broadly, the presence of treeless native vegetation on poorly drained soils. \nUsing API, we then assessed whether Montane Peatlands and Swamps is present within more than 828,000 hectares of state forests within the coastal, tableland and montane regions of eastern NSW. A number of State Forests were excluded from the assessment because they fell below the elevation threshold or were underlain by Triassic sandstone sediments, which are explicitly excluded in the determination for Montane Peatlands and Swamps. \nIn total we identified 1729.5 hectares of candidate Montane Peatlands and Swamps across State Forests in eastern NSW. From this we constructed several operational maps showing the extent of the Montane Peatlands and Swamps TEC within the relevant State Forests. More than 60% of the total mapped areas were located in the southern tablelands. The largest areas of the candidate TEC were mapped in Bago, Glenbog and Badja State Forests in the south, and in Boonoo and Girard State Forests in the north. Patch size varied, with more than 200 patches being smaller than 0.1 hectare and around 50 patches being larger than 30 hectares. \nIt is noted that the broad mapping criteria will have captured a wide range of floristic assemblages including swamps, bogs, marshes, fens, meadows, grasslands and herb fields. Not all of these assemblage will be Montane Peatlands and Swamps, and it is highly likely that the mapping has captured two related TECs due to their overlapping environmental gradients and similar vegetation structure. These two TECs (Upland Wetlands of the Drainage Divide of the New England Bioregion and Carex Sedgeland of the New England Tableland, Nandewar, Brigalow Belt South and NSW North Coast Bioregions) are both candidate TECs within State Forests in their own right.\nOperational TEC Mapping have been derived by API at a viewing scale between 1-4000 using ADS40 50 cm pixel imagery and 1 m derived LIDAR DEM grids for floodplain EECs.",

    "description": "Map notes:North Esk &amp; Tamar Flood Water Surface ProfilesFor use in Planning GeneralThese maps indicate North Esk derived flood levels from the Black Bridge to Corra Linn. The maximum flood levels below Hobblers Bridge and in the Tamar are determined by South Esk discharges into the Tamar which provide higher elevations than the North Esk discharges for the same Average Recurrence Interval (ARI).This map is primarily intended for use in planning to that end it includes:A 100 year ARI profile with current sea level conditionsA 100 year ARI profile with 800mm rise in sea levelA 200 year ARI profileDischargesHydro Consulting was commissioned to review the South Esk hydrology while the North Esk hydrology was derived by the University of New South Wales Water Research laboratory. The Table 1 indicates the results of latter study used in the construction of this map.Flood Return Period in Years ARINorth Esk Flood Discharges (UNSW WRL 2006)South Esk Discharges (Hydro Consulting 2008)1034514302041918105052623301006142910200710(Monte Carlo Range)1850 3430 39905008514630Table 1The adopted tail-water level used in the North Esk analysis for this map was 2.1 m AHD at the junction with the Tamar for all discharges. This represents the highest astronomical tide at Launceston with average atmospheric pressure and neutral wind conditions. The North Esk model was successfully calibrated to the flood which occurred on 30thAugust 2005 which peaked at 470 cumecs and the flood which occurred on 21stJune 2011 at 251 cumecs.",

The data spans every two years between 2012-2016 and is aggregated to Statistical Area Level 3 (SA3) geographic areas from the 2011 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nThe Child and Maternal Health Indicators have been calculated from the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare (AIHW) National Mortality Database and Register of Births and National Perinatal Data Collection. This measure has been calculated with the numerator as the total number of low birthweight liveborn singleton babies, and the denominator as the total number of live births.\nFor further information about this dataset, visit the data source:Australian Institute of Health and Welfare - Child and Maternal Health Data Tables.\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data.\n\n\nThis dataset uses the World Health Organisation (WHO) definition of a low birthweight baby as weighing less than 2,500 grams.\n\n\nData at the area level exclude births to Australian non-residents and women who could not be allocated because their usual residence was not stated or was not valid.\n\n\nMultiple births and stillbirths have been excluded.\n\n\nPercentage for an area are suppressed for publication and marked as 'NP' if the total number of liveborn singleton babies for the area is less than 100.\n\n",

    "description": "    \n\nMean annual (00) and monthly (01a|12) transpiration (mm) from the plant canopy\nfor the period 1980-1999.Interpretation:Canopy transpiration is far more\nspatially variable than potential evaporation, reflecting the effects of water\nlimitation in most areas of the continent. Both the annual mean and seasonal\npattern broadly resemble the corresponding patterns for rainfall. Canopy\ntranspiration maps have more acontrasta (relative variation) than the total\nevaporation or rainfall maps because transpiration is a small component of\ntotal evaporation in areas of low plant cover (the remainder being soil\nevaporation).The partitioning between soil evaporation and canopy\ntranspiration in the model is determined by leaf area index.Notes: These are\nmodel-based estimates from the BiosEquil model. Results are given for the\naBASEa (pre-1788) and aAGRICa (present day) conditions.

    "description": "Transport for NSW provides projections of employment at the small area (Travel Zone or TZ) level for NSW. The latest version is Travel Zone Projections 2024 (TZP24), released in January 2025.\nTZP24 replaces the previously published TZP22.\nThe projections are developed to support a strategic view of NSW and are aligned with the NSW Government Common Planning Assumptions.\nTZP24 Employment Projections are for employed persons by place of work. They are provided by Industry using two breakdowns:\n\n\n33 industry categories (equivalent to the ABS 1-digit Australia and New Zealand Standard Industrial Classification (ANZSIC) codes with the exception of Manufacturing which is at 2-digit level).\n\n\n4 Broad Industry Categories (groupings of the above).\n\n\nThe projections in this release, TZP24, are presented annually from 2021 to 2031 and 5-yearly from 2031 to 2066, and are in TZ21 geography.\nPlease note, TZP24 is based on best available data as at early 2024, and the projections incorporate results of the National Census conducted by the ABS in August 2021.\nKey Data Inputs used:\n\n\nTZP24 Workforce Projections\n\n\nCensus 2021 Place of Work by Destination Zone - ABS\n\n\nNSW Intergenerational Report - NSW Treasury\n\n\nSA4 Employment by industry projections - Victoria University\n\n\nFuture Employment Development Database (FEDD) - a custom dataset compiled by TfNSW between August 2023 and February 2024, that presents the number of jobs expected from major projects based on publicly available documents.\n\n\nFor a summary of the TZP24 Projections method please refer to the TZP24 Factsheet.\nFor more detail on the projection process please refer to the TZP24  Technical Guide.\nAdditional land use information for population and workforce as well as Travel Zone 2021 boundaries for NSW (TZ21) and concordance files are also available for download on the Open Data Hub.\nVisualisations of the employment projections are available on the Transport for NSW Website.\nCautions\nThe TZP24 dataset represents one view of the future aligned with the NSW Government Common Planning Assumptions for population and employment projections.\nThe projections are not based on specific assumptions about future new transport infrastructure, but do take into account known land-use developments underway or planned, and strategic plans.\n\n\nTZP24 is a strategic state-wide dataset and caution should be exercised when considering results at detailed breakdowns.\n\n\nThe TZP24 outputs represent a point in time set of projections (as at early -2024).\n\n\nThe projections are not government targets.\n\n\nTravel Zone (TZ) level outputs are projections only and should be used as a guide. As with all small area data, aggregating of travel zone projections to higher geographies leads to more robust results.\n\n\nAs a general rule, TZ-level projections are illustrative of a possible future only.\n\n\nMore specific advice about data reliability for the specific variables projected is provided in the “Read Me” page of the Excel format summary spreadsheets on the TfNSW Open Data Hub.\n\n\nCaution is advised when comparing TZP24 with the previous set of projections (TZP22) due to addition of new data sources for the most recent years, and adjustments to methodology.\n\n\nFurther cautions and notes can be found in the TZP24 Technical Guide.",

    "description": "Heroes of the Great War Indexing Project - over 17,000 references to notices published in the South Australian newspaper The Chronicle between 1915 and 1919. Some service personnel had more than one notice within the paper. \nThe notices were published under various headings including 'Heroes of the Great War', 'Heroes of the Empire', 'Died on Active Service' and ‘Biographical’. \nThe notices were placed by relatives and friends of approximately 10,000 World War I service personnel who died, or were wounded, or were decorated. Some newspaper printing errors have been corrected using official sources.\nData set of 9514 notices includes the reference (date, page and column) within The Chronicle, brief biographical details including name, age, rank, battalion and occasionally place of death. Also included are names of relatives and place of residence in South Australia by street address, suburb or town.\nSome obituaries within The Chronicle have portraits, although included in this data set, a separate data set has been created for those entries that have portraits.",

    "description": "\n## **Abstract** \nThe dataset was compiled by the Geological and Bioregional Assessment Program from multiple sources identified in the Lineage field in this metadata statement. A landscape classification approach was used to determine how hydrological changes due to shale, tight and deep coal gas development may affect ecosystems at a landscape scale in the Cooper GBA region. Seven landscape classes have been identified for the Cooper GBA region.\n\n\n## **Attribution** \nGeological and Bioregional Assessment Program\n\n\n## **History** \nInputs into the landscape classification were based on existing classification schemes wherever possible and can be purely physical, biological or predictive.\r\nThe landscape classification developed for the Cooper GBA region is a harmonisation of the Queensland Land Zones (Wilson and Taylor, 2012) and South Australian Land Systems (Santos, 1997), reflecting the substantial areas of the Cooper Basin in both states. Consistent with the principles outlined above, it sought to use existing data sources and classifications, and to leverage the extensive effort already expended to develop highly relevant conceptual models at both landscape scale and wetland scale by the Queensland Government as part of its Wetlands Program (Department of Environment and Science (Qld), 2017).\r\nDetailed land zones (Qld) within the Cooper GBA region were supplied by the Queensland Government (Department of Environment and Science (Qld), 2018a) and assigned to corresponding landscape classes. Land systems in South Australia (Santos, 1997) were coarsely mapped in the 1990s; hence, landscape classes for the Cooper Basin within SA were refined from land systems based on land system mapping, detailed (1:100 000) surface geology (Department for Energy and Mining (SA), 2018), elevation (Geoscience Australia, 2008) and landscape position inferred from 30 m Landsat images.",

    "description": "# What is IPGOD?\r\nThe Intellectual Property Government Open Data (IPGOD) includes over 100 years of registry data on all intellectual property (IP) rights administered by IP Australia. It also has derived information about the applicants who filed these IP rights, to allow for research and analysis at the regional, business and individual level. This is the 2019 release of IPGOD.\r\n\r\n\r\n# How do I use IPGOD?\r\nIPGOD is large, with millions of data points across up to 40 tables, making them too large to open with Microsoft Excel. Furthermore, analysis often requires information from separate tables which would need specialised software for merging. We recommend that advanced users interact with the IPGOD data using the right tools with enough memory and compute power. This includes a wide range of programming and statistical software such as Tableau, Power BI, Stata, SAS, R, Python, and Scalar.\r\n\r\n\r\n# IP Data Platform\r\nIP Australia is also providing free trials to a cloud-based analytics platform with the capabilities to enable working with large intellectual property datasets, such as the IPGOD, through the web browser, without any installation of software. [IP Data Platform](https://www.ipdataplatform.com)\r\n\r\n# References\r\n\r\nThe following pages can help you gain the understanding of the intellectual property administration and processes in Australia to help your analysis on the dataset.\r\n\r\n* [Patents](https://www.ipaustralia.gov.au/patents/)\r\n* [Trade Marks](https://www.ipaustralia.gov.au/trade-marks/)\r\n* [Designs](https://www.ipaustralia.gov.au/designs/)\r\n* [Plant Breeder’s Rights](https://www.ipaustralia.gov.au/plant-breeders-rights/)\r\n\r\n\r\n# Updates\r\n\r\n### Tables and columns\r\n\r\nDue to the changes in our systems, some tables have been affected.\r\n\r\n* We have added IPGOD 225 and IPGOD 325 to the dataset!\r\n* The IPGOD 206 table is not available this year.\r\n* Many tables have been re-built, and as a result may have different columns or different possible values. Please check the data dictionary for each table before use.\r\n\r\n### Data quality improvements\r\n\r\nData quality has been improved across all tables.\r\n\r\n* Null values are simply empty rather than '31/12/9999'.\r\n* All date columns are now in ISO format 'yyyy-mm-dd'.\r\n* All indicator columns have been converted to Boolean data type (True/False) rather than Yes/No, Y/N, or 1/0.\r\n* All tables are encoded in UTF-8.\r\n* All tables use the backslash \\ as the escape character.\r\n* The applicant name cleaning and matching algorithms have been updated. We believe that this year's method improves the accuracy of the matches. Please note that the \"ipa_id\" generated in IPGOD 2019 will not match with those in previous releases of IPGOD.",

    "description": "A glacial refuge-dependent forest community is considered to be one that occupies a climatic or topographic refuge retaining elements of the climatic regime of the last Ice Age. Rainforest undoubtedly qualifies as such a community in Tasmania. \n\nThe last Ice Age began in the Quaternary Period, around 40 000 years BP; it peaked between 20 000 and 17 000 years BP, continuing to a lesser degree until 10 000 years BP. During this time there was glaciation in the Snowy Mountains and the land bridge between Victoria and Tasmania was re-established. \n\nAs well as being colder, the climate was much drier. After about 10 000 BP temperatures and precipitation began to increase, reaching a post-Ice Age peak about 8000 years ago. The climate has since become slightly drier, although the warming effect of the ocean has maintained higher rainfall in sub-coastal areas. \n\nParts of Tasmania exhibit relatively steep environmental and topographic gradients. This means that slight changes in global climate may produce significant localised effects.\n\nThis database is a digital polygon coverage of Tasmania (captured at 1:500 000) detailing glacial refugia areas. Glacial refugia are coded with a unique number and the relevant National Estate values and criteria.\n\nAll sites in this coverage are classified according to National Estate criteria A1: Importance in the evolution of Australian flora, fauna, landscapes or climate.\n\nThis is an archived dataset jointly owned by the Commonwealth and the Tasmanian Governments under the Tasmania-Commonwealth Regional Forest Agreement (RFA) data agreement of 8th November 1997.This data is available to the public under licence from the Department as part of the Commonwealth Spatial Data Access and Pricing Policy.\n\nAny reproduction of this dataset must carry the following statement:\nCopyright Commonwealth of Australia and Tasmanian Government 1997.\nDepartmental Deed",

    "description": "The  Australian fisheries economic indicators report  expands on and takes the place of the long running ABARES  Australian fisheries surveys report. The report presents results from ABARES' fishery surveys on financial returns to fishers and net economic returns from fisheries to the Australian community. The report includes a range of other economic indicators, including productivity analysis. \r\n\r\nThis report covers the Commonwealth Trawl Sector (CTS), and the Gillnet, Hook and Trap Sector (GHTS) of the Southern and Eastern Scalefish and Shark Fishery (SESSF), with new results for financial years 2011-12, 2012-13 and 2013-14. \r\n\r\n Key issues  \r\n• Profit at full equity - an estimate of profits based on all assets being fully owned by operators - has decreased since 2008-09, from $267 000 to $205 000 in 2012-13. In the Gillnet, Hook and Trap Sector, it has fallen from $200 000 in 2008-09 to $15 000 in 2012-13. This indicator assumes that all assets are fully owned by operators, and includes income from all sources. \r\n• Net economic return in the Commonwealth Trawl Sector has declined from $7.3 million in 2010-11 to an estimated $1.4 million in 2013-14. Net economic returns in the Gillnet, Hook and Trap Sector has declined from $7.2 million to an estimated -$4.4 million in 2013-14. \r\n• The decline in net economic returns in both sectors may suggest that the total allowable catch settings may be misaligned with the Harvest Strategy Policy target of achieving maximum economic yield from the fishery. \r\n",

This census approach provides a comprehensive view of the APS and ensures no eligible respondents are omitted from the survey sample, removing sampling bias and reducing sample error. The census' content is designed to establish the views of APS employees on workplace issues such as leadership, learning and development and job satisfaction. The census ran from 11 May to 12 June 2015. Overall, 91,937 APS employees responded to the employee census, a response rate of 66%. \r\n\r\nPlease be aware that the very large number of respondents to the employee census means these files are up to 200 mb in size.

    "description": "This dataset presents counts of payment recipients by payment type for the quarter ending June 2018. The data is based on the recipient's geocoded address aggregated by Statistical Area Level 2 (SA2) from the Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS) 2011.\nThe Department of Social Services (DSS) is the Australian Government's lead agency in the development and delivery of social policy, and is working to improve the lifetime wellbeing of people and families in Australia. DSS' policies and services respond to need across people's lives - looking after families, children and older people; providing a safety net for people who cannot fully support themselves; enhancing the wellbeing of people with high needs; assisting people who need help with care; and supporting a diverse and harmonious society. DSS supports people and families in Australia by encouraging independence and participation, and supporting a cohesive society.\nFor more information on this dataset please visit the Australian Government Open Data.\nFor further details on payments, see 'A guide to Australian Government payments'.\nPlease note:\n\n\nIn order to protect individuals' privacy, identified populations between 1 and 4 have been suppressed and replaced with '&lt;5' for confidentiality purposes. Additional data may be suppressed and replaced with 'n.p.' (not provided) to prevent the derivation of identified populations that have values of less than 5.\n\n\nCaveats specific to payments type can be found in the relevant payment description of the original data.\n\n\nAURIN has spatialised this dataset and have made the following replacements to enforce data type consistency: \n\n\n'&lt;5' has been assigned a value of '-1' within the data\n\n\nA boolean field has been created for each data field to flag left-censored data. 'True' is assigned to fields that have been censored.\n\n\n'n.p.' (not provided) has been set to Null within the data.\n\n",

    "description": "This data was collected in November 2012 by the IMOS Ship of Opportunity Underway CO2 Measurement research group on MV L'Astrolabe (IMOS platform code: FHZI) voyage AL1213R0.\n\nDeparted:   Dumont d'Urville station, Antarctica, November 17, 2012\nArrived:  Hobart Australia, November 22, 2012\n\n\nCO2 System Overview:\nThe fugacity of carbon dioxide (fCO2) in surface seawater was measured using a General Oceanics Inc. automated system (Model 8050; Pierrot et al 2009). Seawater is sprayed into an equilibration chamber and CO2 in the headspace gas equilibrates with the seawater. The headspace gas is pumped through a thermoelectric condenser followed by a nafion drying tube, before flowing through a Licor 7000 non-dispersive infrared gas analyser used to measure the CO2 mole fraction (XCO2) of the dried air. The gas flow is stopped temporarily for the CO2 measurements, which are made at atmospheric pressure. A set of four CO2 standards (Table 1) that cover the range of CO2 values expected in the ocean are analysed about every three hours to calibrate the gas analyser. Atmospheric XCO2 (dry) is measured after the standards by pumping clean outside air from an intake on the forward mast of the ship. \n\nThe seawater intake is at about 3m depth in the bow of the ship. A remote temperature sensor (Seabird Electronics SBE38) located at the intake is used to measure sea surface temperature (SST). Sea surface salinity is measured using a thermosalinograph (Seabird Electronics SBE21) mounted in the bow thruster space near the intake. The travel time between the intake and CO2 system is typically about 50 seconds with warming usually less than 0.4ºC. The thermosalinograph water is from the same intake and supply line. Meteorological data, salinity, SST, and ships position and time are taken from the ship’s logging system. The salinity values measured by the SBE21 were checked against discrete bottle samples collected on the voyage.\n\nMeteorological data, salinity, SST, and ships position and time are taken from the ships logging system.",

    "description": "This dataset presents counts of payment recipients by payment type for the quarter ending September 2018. The data is based on the recipient's geocoded address aggregated by Statistical Area Level 2 (SA2) from the Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS) 2011.\nThe Department of Social Services (DSS) is the Australian Government's lead agency in the development and delivery of social policy, and is working to improve the lifetime wellbeing of people and families in Australia. DSS' policies and services respond to need across people's lives - looking after families, children and older people; providing a safety net for people who cannot fully support themselves; enhancing the wellbeing of people with high needs; assisting people who need help with care; and supporting a diverse and harmonious society. DSS supports people and families in Australia by encouraging independence and participation, and supporting a cohesive society.\nFor more information on this dataset please visit the Australian Government Open Data.\nFor further details on payments, see 'A guide to Australian Government payments'.\nPlease note:\n\n\nIn order to protect individuals' privacy, identified populations between 1 and 4 have been suppressed and replaced with '&lt;5' for confidentiality purposes. Additional data may be suppressed and replaced with 'n.p.' (not provided) to prevent the derivation of identified populations that have values of less than 5.\n\n\nCaveats specific to payments type can be found in the relevant payment description of the original data.\n\n\nAURIN has spatialised this dataset and have made the following replacements to enforce data type consistency: \n\n\n'&lt;5' has been assigned a value of '-1' within the data\n\n\nA boolean field has been created for each data field to flag left-censored data. 'True' is assigned to fields that have been censored.\n\n\n'n.p.' (not provided) has been set to Null within the data.\n\n",

He carried out his investigations until the well had reached the depth of 4,659 feet, and returned to Canberra on December 30th. Preliminary determinations of foraminifera and radiolaria were made at the site. This report is the result of detailed examination of the microfossils which were brought back to Canberra.",

    "description": "This section houses over 55,000 registered and 6,000 unregistered specimens including skins, eggs, skeletons, nests and spirit collections. It has an excellent collection of South Australian species, both historical and recent, a large collection of stomach contents, which is used to determine diets, and an Australia wide collection of eggs. \nThe SA Museum manages this dataset using the KE EMu collection management system. It is interpreted into the Darwin Core metadata schema (DwC) and semi-regularly exported to the Atlas of Living Australia (ALA: http://www.ala.org.au/) and the Online Zoological Collections of Australian Museums (OZCAM: http://www.ozcam.org.au/). Information about Darwin Core can be found here: http://rs.tdwg.org/dwc/index.htm. Data sourced from Australian museums on both the ALA and OZCAM should be identical, but on ALA they are combined with observational data from citizen science initiatives and other sources. \nBoth of those sites make it possible to combine, interrogate and analyse data through web services such as the Spatial Analysis Portal (http://spatial.ala.org.au/). In the Spatial Portal ALA data can be combined with meteorological and other environmental data sourced from and made accessible by relevant government agencies. \nData about endangered species are either withheld from online publication, or coordinates or other data are obscured on the ALA and OZCAM. In those circumstances more specific information is available directly from SA Museum collection managers if it is genuinely required for research purposes. \nSA Museum data can be downloaded in full from the Atlas of Living Australia, or broken down into discipline specific parts (e.g. Herpetology, Mammalogy etc). On download the ALA will request an email address (not mandatory) and a reason for download (mandatory) – this is required to track usage of the ALA data to help data providers determine priorities for upload and improvement.",

The Future Reef MAP project is funded by Rio Tinto Alcan and administered by the Great Barrier Reef Foundation, with an equal co-investment by CSIRO. The project is the first large-scale CO2 observing system established on the Great Barrier Reef using the Rio Tinto ship, RTM Wakmatha. The research is targeted at providing information on the CO2 uptake and the controls on ocean acidification change in the region. It is providing foundation data needed to assess the vulnerability of the GBR reefs to ocean acidification. This dataset contains quality controlled underway measurements of the fugacity of CO2, atmospheric pressure, and sea surface temperature and salinity. The data management and distribution of these data were supported by the CSIRO Carbon Collaboration Cluster and the Australian Coastal Ecosystem Facility.",

    "description": "The <strong>Climate Vulnerability Assessment</strong> was designed to provide an overview of the impact of future climate change on all stages of production for the commodities and biosecurity risks assessed. The project used multicriteria analysis (MCA) models to produce assessments for the commodities and biosecurity risks in a consistent and comparable way, and a framework was developed to provide a rigorous, flexible and transparent process for assessing vulnerabilities and opportunities to climate change. Details of the approach and the climate data used in the assessments can be found in the <a href=\"https://www.dpi.nsw.gov.au/dpi/climate/climate-vulnerability-assessment/publications-and-reports\">Methodology Report</a> which also details model exclusions and assumptions.\n\nAssessments were undertaken on commodities grouped into 6 nodes: <em>Horticulture and Viticulture</em>, <em>Broadacre Cropping</em>, <em>Forestry</em>, <em>Extensive Livestock</em>, <em>Marine Fisheries</em>, as well as for a set of biosecurity risks related to these primary industry sectors. The <a href=\"https://www.dpi.nsw.gov.au/dpi/climate/climate-vulnerability-assessment/publications-and-reports\">Summary Report</a> gives details of the chosen commodities and biosecurity risks and summarises the high-level results.\n\nResults Reports for each commodity and biosecurity risk are being released. Visit the <a href=\"https://www.dpi.nsw.gov.au/dpi/climate/climate-vulnerability-assessment\">project's web pages</a> to access these reports and for further information.\n\nThis dataset contains maps of modelled climate suitability for the <strong>irrigated wheat</strong> model in the Broadacre Cropping node of the DPIRD Climate Vulnerability Assessment. Maps are provided (in GeoTIFF format) for each element of the model: the overall climate suitability, climate suitability maps for each phenophase and also for each phenophase/climate variable combination in the model. Data is provided for each of the eight global climate models (GCMs) used in the project, as well as the climate suitability derived from historical observations, along with the ensemble median for each map.",

    "description": "This is a multi-sensor SSTfnd L3S product for a single 72 hour period, derived using sea surface temperature retrievals from the VIIRS sensor on the Suomi-NPP satellite and JPSS series of satellites, and AVHRR sensor on the NOAA and Metop series of Polar-orbiting satellites. The sensors and satellite platforms contributing to each file are listed in the sensor and platform global attributes in the file header. The SSTfnd is derived by adding a constant 0.17 degC to the NOAA AVHRR SSTskin observations, and 0 degC to the Metop and VIIRS SSTsubskin observations, after rejecting observations with low surface wind speeds (&lt;6 m/s by day and &lt;2 m/s at night). The Multi-sensor L3S product is provided as a 0.02deg x 0.02deg cylindrical equidistant projected map over the region 70E to 170W, 20N to 70S. The quality level for each pixel was remapped using the original ACSPO VIIRS and AVHRR L3U quality levels and Sensor Specific Error Statistics (SSES), as described in Griffin et al. (2017) Appendix at http://imos.org.au/facilities/srs/sstproducts/sstdata0/sstdata-references/, before compositing single swaths from the sensors. Each grid cell contains the 72 hour average of all the highest available quality SSTs that overlap with that cell, weighted by the area of overlap. Refer to the IMOS SST products web page at http://imos.org.au/sstproducts.html for further information.",

Rehua (IMOS platform code: ZMRE).\n\nDeparted:  Australia, August 13, 2011\nArrived:  \t New Zealand, August 17, 2011\n\nBio acoustic signals allow understanding how mid-water prey species (known collectively as micronekton) such as small fish, squid, krill and jellyfish are distributed. \n\nMid-water prey form the core of the ocean food web, transferring energy from primary producers at the ocean surface to top predators such as tunas, billfish, sharks, seals and seabirds.The mass and distribution of micronekton reflects broad-scale patterns in the structure and function of the ocean, as well as the dynamics of marine ecosystems. \n\nAcoustic mapping is done from fishing and scientific vessels that are equipped with scientifically-calibrated 38 kHz digital echo-sounders that record a slice of acoustic backscatter to a depth of 1500 meters.",

    "title": "Southern Ocean Time Series (SOTS) - Phytoplankton Abundance and Biovolume",
    "description": "This dataset comprises the phytoplankton abundance and biovolume estimates as part of a broader sampling program carried out at the Southern Ocean Time Series, a facility within the Integrated Marine Observing System (IMOS). The primary focus is sustained observing of ocean properties and processes important to climate, carbon cycling, and ocean productivity. Regular phytoplankton samples are collected at approximately 14 day intervals (exact intervals and seasonal coverage dependent on deployment length). The moorings are serviced annually, at which time the existing moorings are recovered and new moorings are deployed. Water samples from within the surface mixed-layer are collected at pre-programmed intervals using a Remote Access Sampler, in pairs about 1 hour apart. One sample in each pair is preserved for phytoplankton community composition by microscopy, and the other sample is preserved and used for accompanying chemical analysis of nutrients, total dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) and alkalinity. \nEach sample is collected from within the surface mixed-layer at 32 m depth (2010 - 2017) or 5 m depth (2018-current) depending on the design of the mooring surface assembly and instrumentation. Typically a maximum of 24 samples are collected over an annual deployment cycle. The samples collected are analysed for: 1. Community composition / abundance (cells/L) 2. calculated biovolume (um3/L). Protocols for the phytoplankton time-series are described in Eriksen et al (2018), and the annual sample reports for each deployment.\nData storage and access is planned to be interoperable with other national and international programs through the IMOS Infrastructure. Station metadata can be found through this resource. Data is available freely via the AODN portal: https://portal.aodn.org.au. As the taxonomic resolution of the data has changed over time, due to continual training, it is important that users refer to the change log tables included in your data download. These will provide information on the validity of the taxa, from what date we have been identifying certain taxa etc. Classification fields may be blank depending on the level to which that taxa has been identified, i.e. if only identified to family, genus and species will be blank.",

    "description": "This dataset translates solar irradiance into estimated daily photovoltaic energy output (kWh) for individual buildings, incorporating panel characteristics and temperature efficiency losses to deliver actionable generation estimates.\n\nCovering approximately 16,000 footprints, the dataset provides monthly daily average PV potential values that account for panel efficiency (27%), temperature coefficient (-0.5%/°C), and optimal panel layout within each rooftop geometry. These values represent realistic generation expectations from standard mid-performance panels (0.96 x 1.64m, 300W), enabling direct comparison of building-level solar capacity across the urban area.\n\nThe dataset was created to bridge the gap between raw irradiance data and practical energy planning. By incorporating panel specifications and calculating maximum feasible panel counts per rooftop (accounting for edge setbacks and spacing), it delivers estimates directly usable for installation feasibility studies and energy self-sufficiency analysis.\n\nTarget users include building owners evaluating solar investment opportunities, property developers assessing renewable energy contributions, and municipal planners setting district-level clean energy targets. The daily average format provides accessible seasonal generation patterns without requiring specialised photovoltaic modelling software.\n\nEstimates assume flat-mounted panels in optimal orientation and do not account for actual roof pitch, shading, or site-specific installation constraints. For hourly generation profiles needed for grid integration studies or battery sizing, reference the hourly PV potential dataset. For customised panel specifications, apply your parameters to the irradiance datasets.\n\nComprehensive technical documentation, including data dictionary, usage examples, and processing methodology, is available in <a href=\"https://resources.aurin.org.au/ckan/resources/DataSet-Information.pdf\">here</a>; software stack details and calculation workflows are documented in <a href=\"https://resources.aurin.org.au/ckan/resources/Software_Stack.pdf\">here</a>.",

The Table 1 indicates the results of latter study used in the construction of this map.Flood Return Period in Years ARINorth Esk Flood Discharges (UNSW WRL 2006)South Esk Discharges (Hydro Consulting 2008)1034514302041918105052623301006142910200710(Monte Carlo Range)1850 3430 39905008514630Table 1The adopted tail-water level used in the North Esk analysis for this map was 2.1 m AHD at the junction with the Tamar for all discharges. This represents the highest astronomical tide at Launceston with average atmospheric pressure and neutral wind conditions. The North Esk model was successfully calibrated to the flood which occurred on 30thAugust 2005 which peaked at 470 cumecs and the flood which occurred on 21stJune 2011 at 251 cumecs.",

The data is based on the recipient's geocoded address aggregated by Statistical Area Level 2 (SA2) from the Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS) 2011.\nThe Department of Social Services (DSS) is the Australian Government's lead agency in the development and delivery of social policy, and is working to improve the lifetime wellbeing of people and families in Australia. DSS' policies and services respond to need across people's lives - looking after families, children and older people; providing a safety net for people who cannot fully support themselves; enhancing the wellbeing of people with high needs; assisting people who need help with care; and supporting a diverse and harmonious society. DSS supports people and families in Australia by encouraging independence and participation, and supporting a cohesive society.\nFor more information on this dataset please visit the Australian Government Open Data.\nFor further details on payments, see 'A guide to Australian Government payments'.\nPlease note:\n\n\nIn order to protect individuals' privacy, identified populations between 1 and 4 have been suppressed and replaced with '&lt;5' for confidentiality purposes. Additional data may be suppressed and replaced with 'n.p.' (not provided) to prevent the derivation of identified populations that have values of less than 5.\n\n\nCaveats specific to payments type can be found in the relevant payment description of the original data.\n\n\nAURIN has spatialised this dataset and have made the following replacements to enforce data type consistency: \n\n\n'&lt;5' has been assigned a value of '-1' within the data\n\n\nA boolean field has been created for each data field to flag left-censored data. 'True' is assigned to fields that have been censored.\n\n\n'n.p.' (not provided) has been set to Null within the data.\n\n",

The location of the client is based on their place of usual residence. The data spans the financial years between 2014-2016 and is aggregated to 2015 Department of Health Primary Health Network (PHN) areas, based on the 2011 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS). \nThe data is sourced from the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare (AIHW) - National Hospital Morbidity Database (NHMD), which is a compilation of episode-level records from admitted patient care data collection systems in Australian hospitals in each state and territory. The NHMD is based on data provided to the AIHW by state and territory health authorities for the National minimum data set (NMDS) for Admitted patient care.\nFor further information about this dataset, visit the data source: Australian Institute of Health and Welfare - Indigenous Eye Health Measures 2017 Data Tables.\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data using the Department of Health - PHN Areas.\n\n\nThe data are crude rates.\n\n\nData by PHN should be interpreted with caution due to variations in admission practices, and because patients may be hospitalised outside the PHN where they reside.\n\n\nThe quality of data provided for Indigenous status varies. Time-series analyses may also be affected by changes in the quality of Indigenous identification over time.\n\n",

A railway can be heavy rails, light rail, monorail and heavy rail siding, for example a railway, tramway or monorail.Initial Publication Date01/05/2024Data Currency01/05/2024Data Update FrequencyOtherContent SourceData provider filesFile TypeScene Layer Package (*.slpk)AttributionData Theme, Classification or Relationship to other DatasetsTransport Theme of the NSW Foundation Spatial Data FrameworkAccuracyThe dataset maintains a positional relationship to, and alignment with, the Lot and Property digital datasets. The Lot and Property data was captured by digitising the best available cadastral mapping at a variety of scales and accuracies, ranging from 1:500 to 1:250 000 according to the National Mapping Council of Australia, Standards of Map Accuracy (1975). Therefore, the position of the feature instance will be within 0.5mm at the map scale for 90% of the well-defined points. That is 1:500 = 0.25m, 1:2000 = 1m, 1:4000 = 2m, 1:25000 = 12.5m, 1:50000 = 25m and 1:00000 = 50m. A program of positional upgrade (accuracy improvement) is currently underway. Feature heights have been derived from LiDAR elevation sources including 1m and 2m DEMS. The data used to create the DEMs have an accuracy of 0.3m (95% Confidence Interval) vertical and 0.8m (95% Confidence Interval) horizontal. The features vertical accuracy is also a function of its horizon.Spatial Reference System (dataset)WGS84Spatial Reference System (web service)EPSG:4326WGS84 Equivalent ToGDA2020Spatial ExtentContent LineageData ClassificationUnclassifiedData Access PolicyOpenData QualityTerms and ConditionsCreative CommonStandard and SpecificationData CustodianSpatial Services | Department of Customer ServicesPoint of ContactSS-SDS@customerservice.nsw.gov.auData AggregatorSpatial Services | Department of Customer ServicesData DistributorSpatial Services | Department of Customer ServicesAdditional Supporting InformationOpen Geospatial Consortium (OGC) implemented and compatible for the consumption by common GIS platforms.

    "description": "\n## **Abstract** \nThis dataset represents a historic annual time-series of estimated habitat condition across the study region, from 2001 to 2018 inclusive. These spatial grids were developed by combining two spatial data products: (1) a new analytical approach called Compere, which contrasts the vegetation cover of each location with a set of environmentally similar locations across the region, for each year; (2) a temporally static spatial layer on the total length of all linear anthropogenic disturbances, in each 500 m grid cell across the study region. The resultant habitat condition spatial time-series is therefore intended to combine information on both localised (e.g. roads, seismic surveys) and dispersed (e.g grazing, fire)  influences on the habitat condition for biodiversity of each location, ranging continuously from '0' (completely degraded) to '1' (pristine).\n\n\n## **Attribution** \nGeological and Bioregional Assessment Program\n\n\n## **History** \nTo derive a past-to-present time-series of habitat condition across the buffered study regions, we combined two spatial data products. The first set of spatial data come from a new analytical approach called Compere, which contrasts the vegetation cover of each location with a set of environmentally similar locations across the region. For the present purpose, we applied the Absolute Range Ratio (ARR) metric from Compere, which for each location at a time-point is the observed vegetation cover divided by the maximum vegetation cover across all the environmentally similar locations at that time-point. The ARR spatial layers were available for each year from 2001 to 2018 inclusive. To translate the ARR spatial layers to better represent a habitat condition metric (h_ARR), we rescaled the ARR values as: \r\nh_ARR=ARR+(k×((100-ARR)/100))\r\nwith the scalar k specifying the minimum habitat condition value set to 40 % for the present analysis.\r\n\r\nThe second spatial dataset used in deriving habitat condition for biodiversity was a spatial layer on the total length of all linear disturbances in each 500 m grid cell across the study regions. We converted this layer into a habitat condition metric (hL) by assuming complete habitat loss for a width of 10 m for all linear disturbances, then taking the inverse of the proportion of each grid cell area that was disturbed.\r\n\r\nThese two data sources on habitat condition provide complementary information. The h_ARR condition metric derived from the Compere analysis is useful in detecting the broadscale impacts of actions such as grazing and fire management across the region on habitat condition. In contrast, the hL condition metric derived from the spatial data on linear disturbances is useful in identifying known disturbances, such as roads, fence-lines and seismic survey lines. We therefore combined these two condition metrics, using a conservative approach of taking the minimum condition value from each of these metrics, for each grid cell:\r\nh=min(h_ARR,h_L )\r\nassuming a constant level of linear disturbance over the time period of the Compere analysis (2001-2018). This provided an historic annual time series of habitat condition across each study region.",

The Signs layer includes Panel, Plank and Totem signs on and sometimes adjacent to NPWS Estate and what type, style and material they are.\n\nThe Assets Geodatabase is directly related to the Assets Maintenance System (AMS) which runs under SAP and contains similar fields, values and business rules. The Assets Geodatabase is the vehicle in which spatial assets are initially captured, edited and stored so that the features have coordinates and can be viewed spatially. The data is collected across the entire NSW National Parks Estate and includes some off-park features for fire management, access and mapping purposes. The spatial feature data is manually synchronised with the AMS. The two systems run side by side and are linked by an ID field. AMS is also set up to be used by other OEH Divisions eg. Botanic Gardens and Parklands and previously Marine Parks.\nThe database includes the following asset Feature Class types - Barrier, Bridge or Elevated Walkway, Building, Communication Equipment, Crossing, Drainage Point, Environmental Monitoring Station, Extractive industry, Facility, Fence Handrail, Fire Management Zone, Gate, Hydraulic Point, Hydraulic Storage Point, Hydraulic Valve, Irrigation System, Landing, Landing Strip, Lookout, Natural Feature, Other Structure, Parking Area, Pipe Channel Section, Power or Communication line, Power or Communication point, Sign, Step point, Stormwater Drainage Line, Surface, Survey Mark, Tower, Track Section, Treatment Disposal System, Visitor Area, Visitor Monitoring Point. \n\nNote that for external supply of the dataset is simplified with certain attribute fields being removed. Those fields that have a name prefixed with \"d_\" contain descriptions extracted from the original geodatabase domains.\n\nDetailed documentation is available including: - Data Dictionary (internal location - P:\\Corporate\\Tools\\Information\\Assets) - Data Model - Business Rules - Functional Location and Naming Convention",

Monitoring is carried out by three different boat-based sampling parties, but is co-ordinated to occur on the same day each month. \nAt each site, in-situ field measurements are taken using calibrated sensors for temperature, salinity, pH, dissolved oxygen and turbidity. Water clarity is also measured using a secchi disk. Surface and bottom water samples are collected for analysis of true color, total suspended solids(TSS), total  and dissolved nutrients, organic carbon and zinc. at most sites, depth integrated samples are also collected for chlorophyll a using a plastic tube. Bottom samples in the Middle and Outer estuary are collected using a niskin bottle. Pumps are used in the upper estuary site to fill up the bottles. All water samples are analysed at Analytical Service Tasmania, a National Association of Testing Authorities-accredited laboratory. Monitoring site depth is 2 meters",

    "description": "This dataset presents the footprint of the number and per cent of small for gestational age births, by the mother's usual place of residence. The data spans the year of 2016 and is aggregated to Statistical Area Level 3 (SA3) from the 2011 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nThe data is sourced from the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare (AIHW) National Perinatal Data Collection (NPDC). The NPDC began in 1991 and is a collaborative effort by the AIHW and state and territory health departments. Perinatal data are collected for each birth in each state and territory, usually by midwives and other birth attendants. The data are collated by the relevant state or territory health department and a standard de-identified extract is provided to the AIHW on an annual basis to form the NPDC. The NPDC covers both live births and stillbirths, where gestational age is at least 20 weeks or birth weight is at least 400 grams, except in Victoria and Western Australia, where births are included if gestational age is at least 20 weeks or, if gestation is unknown, birthweight is at least 400 grams.\nThe Mothers and Babies data accompanies the Australia's Mothers and Babies 2016 - In Brief Report.\nFor further information about this dataset, visit the data source: Australian Institute of Health and Welfare - Australia's Mothers and Babies 2016 Data Tables.\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data.\n\n\nBabies are defined as small for gestational age if their birthweight is below the 10th percentile for their gestational age and sex, according to national birthweight percentiles. Includes singleton liveborn babies with known birthweight, gestational age and sex.\n\n\nSA3 is derived from Statistical Area Level 2 (SA2) of the ABS Australian Statistical Geography Standard Edition 2011. Numbers may not sum to totals due to rounding error.\n\n\nExcludes mothers not usually resident in Australia or whose SA2 of usual residence was 'Not stated'.\n\n",

Its position is determined by the methodology used to input into the Topographic Database. Common methods of input include GPS, traced from the cadastre or traced from an orthorectified image.Data included in Road Segments includes:Vehicular TrackPathwayContinuity LineStandard Road&nbsp;On-off RampDual CarriagewayInitial Publication Date01/05/2024Data Currency01/05/2024Data Update FrequencyOtherContent SourceData provider filesFile TypeScene Layer Package (*.slpk)AttributionData Theme, Classification or Relationship to other DatasetsTransport Theme of the NSW Foundation Spatial Data FrameworkAccuracyThe dataset maintains a positional relationship to, and alignment with, the Lot and Property digital datasets. The Lot and Property data was captured by digitising the best available cadastral mapping at a variety of scales and accuracies, ranging from 1:500 to 1:250 000 according to the National Mapping Council of Australia, Standards of Map Accuracy (1975). Therefore, the position of the feature instance will be within 0.5mm at the map scale for 90% of the well-defined points. That is 1:500 = 0.25m, 1:2000 = 1m, 1:4000 = 2m, 1:25000 = 12.5m, 1:50000 = 25m and 1:00000 = 50m. A program of positional upgrade (accuracy improvement) is currently underway. Feature heights have been derived from LiDAR elevation sources including 1m and 2m DEMS. The data used to create the DEMs have an accuracy of 0.3m (95% Confidence Interval) vertical and 0.8m (95% Confidence Interval) horizontal. The features vertical accuracy is also a function of its horizon.Spatial Reference System (dataset)WGS84Spatial Reference System (web service)EPSG:4326WGS84 Equivalent ToGDA2020Spatial ExtentContent LineageData ClassificationUnclassifiedData Access PolicyOpenData QualityTerms and ConditionsCreative CommonStandard and SpecificationData CustodianSpatial Services | Department of Customer ServicesPoint of ContactSS-SDS@customerservice.nsw.gov.auData AggregatorSpatial Services | Department of Customer ServicesData DistributorSpatial Services | Department of Customer ServicesAdditional Supporting InformationOpen Geospatial Consortium (OGC) implemented and compatible for the consumption by common GIS platforms.

    "description": "Long-term average annual extraction limit (LTAAEL) is a regulatory limit set on annual water extractions from a river system. It ensures that average extractions over the long term are sustainable, and thus help prevent environmental degradation.\n\nIn NSW these limits are defined by water sharing plans (WSPs). Every WSP outlines how the water in a river system will be shared over a 10-year period. They also define:\n\n• how LTAAEL compliance is to be assessed for each river system\n\n• what conditions will trigger noncompliance action\n\n• what compliance action can be taken.\n\nThe Natural Resources Commission regularly reviews all WSPs to ensure extractions from each river system are within the limits set, and the Murray-Darling Basin Authority reviews sustainable diversion limit (SDL) compliance each year.\n\nTo assess compliance, we model LTAAEL using a model that has been configured to represent the development and management rules defined by a system WSP (this refers to as LTAAEL model). We then compare this modelled LTAAEL with the modelled under current conditions long-term average annual extractions (LTAAEs) (which are usually those modelled by the annual permitted take, or APT, model). Although, the LTAAEL includes multiple types of water use, the compliance assessment is based on the total. We do this annually using the best available models, and the outcomes are published on the DPE website.\n\nWhere river system’s LTAAE exceed LTAAEL, the system is considered noncompliant. If the noncompliance trigger conditions in the WSP are met, noncompliance action is taken.\n\nThe data set provided contains flows at several gauges in each river system, as simulated by the annually extended LTAAEL model. Notwithstanding the model’s inherent limitations, these are a fair representation of those we would expect under WSP operation and development conditions. They can be compared with flows simulated by other key scenario models, such as annual permitted take (APT) model or without development (WOD) model.",

The data is based on the recipient's geocoded address aggregated by Statistical Area Level 2 (SA2) from the Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS) 2016.\nThe Department of Social Services (DSS) is the Australian Government's lead agency in the development and delivery of social policy, and is working to improve the lifetime wellbeing of people and families in Australia. DSS' policies and services respond to need across people's lives - looking after families, children and older people; providing a safety net for people who cannot fully support themselves; enhancing the wellbeing of people with high needs; assisting people who need help with care; and supporting a diverse and harmonious society. DSS supports people and families in Australia by encouraging independence and participation, and supporting a cohesive society.\nFor more information on this dataset please visit the Australian Government Open Data.\nFor further details on payments, see 'A guide to Australian Government payments'.\nPlease note:\n\n\nIn order to protect individuals' privacy, identified populations between 1 and 4 have been suppressed and replaced with '&lt;5' for confidentiality purposes. Additional data may be suppressed and replaced with 'n.p.' (not provided) to prevent the derivation of identified populations that have values of less than 5.\n\n\nCaveats specific to payments type can be found in the relevant payment description of the original data.\n\n\nAURIN has spatialised this dataset and have made the following replacements to enforce data type consistency: \n\n\n'&lt;5' has been assigned a value of '-1' within the data\n\n\nA boolean field has been created for each data field to flag left-censored data. 'True' is assigned to fields that have been censored.\n\n\n'n.p.' (not provided) has been set to Null within the data.\n\n",

    "description": "Data were collected as part of the FutureReef MAP project, a three-year project designed to monitor ocean chemistry along the entire length of the Great Barrier Reef. The Future Reef MAP project is funded by Rio Tinto Alcan and administered by the Great Barrier Reef Foundation, with an equal co-investment by CSIRO. The project is the first large-scale CO2 observing system established on the Great Barrier Reef using the Rio Tinto ship, RTM Wakmatha. The research is targeted at providing information on the CO2 uptake and the controls on ocean acidification change in the region. It is providing foundation data needed to assess the vulnerability of the GBR reefs to ocean acidification. This dataset contains quality controlled underway measurements of the fugacity of CO2, atmospheric pressure, and sea surface temperature and salinity. The data management and distribution of these data were supported by the CSIRO Carbon Collaboration Cluster and the Australian Coastal Ecosystem Facility.",

    "description": "After nearly two years of monitoring, comprising 126.7 hours over 57 observations with the Parkes telescope and 49.4 hours across 101 observations with the FAST telescopes, we have determined that FRB 20220529 is an extremely active repeater. It exhibits one of the longest activity durations and a potential period. Due to frequent observations scheduled with both Parkes and FAST, we recently observed an abrupt rotation measure (RM) flare in this source. This is the first detection of such an <code>RM flare'' in a fast radio burst (FRB), suggesting that the source is in an environment with occasionally erupting coronal mass ejection. This presents a unique opportunity to study the eruption environment of FRBs and investigate the relation between burst activity and other burst parameters. If confirmed, the periodicity and the</code>RM flare'' of FRB 20220529 would corroborate each other and become a ``smoking gun'' of the binary origin of FRB. In our previous analysis, both Parkes and FAST observations have proven essential. While FAST's higher sensitivity has enabled the capture of many bursts, Parkes' wideband receiver has provided a good burst detection rate even during low-rate phases. Notably, during the RM flare, two high signal-to-noise ratio bursts from Parkes have been crucial in understanding the RM variations. To further investigate FRB 20220529, we have scheduled regular FAST observations every fortnight, monitoring the source for 20 minutes each time. Therefore, we also propose to monitor FRB 20220529 using the Parkes UWL receiver, ensuring high-time resolution and employing full-polarization observations.",

    "description": "    \n\nThis data set shows designated and actual irrigation areas in Australia\ncompiled by the National Land Use Mapping Project of the National Land and\nWater Resources Audit to assist in the identification of irrigation areas in\nAustralia. Additional data custodians include Agriculture WA, Queensland\nDepartment of Natural Resources and Mines, Murray-Darling Basin Commission,\nNew South Wales Department of Land and Water Conservation and Tasmanian\nDepartment of Primary Industries, Water and Environment.aDesignated irrigation\nareasa indicate areas with administratively defined boundaries which have\nassociated rights and obligations pertaining to use of water for irrigation.\nThe precise meaning of the term adesignated irrigation areaa varies from\nregion to region. aActual irrigation areasa indicate areas with\nobservationally defined boundaries within which irrigation is practised. The\nboundaries have been supplied by various agencies and cover the more important\nirrigation areas in Australia. Users of this data set should be aware that\nthere are irrigated areas outside the designated and actual areas shown and\nthat there are non-irrigated areas inside them. This is particularly true of\nTasmania and the Murray-Darling Basin.The data set is available in both vector\nand raster formats. The raster data set can be used as a companion to the\n1996/97 Land Use of Australia data set which is also in raster format. Both\ndata sets have the same coordinate system, boundary coordinates and cell size\nso that they can easily be overlaid. Users may find, however, that some cells\nare classified as irrigated by the Australian Irrigation Areas data set and as\nnon-agricultural land by the 1996/97 Land Use of Australia data set.The\nVersion 1a data set may be of use to researchers and policy makers in need of\nnational, regional or local scale irrigation data, though the scale of the\nsource material is highly variable and completedness of coverage is poor in\nsome regions.\n\nSee [further metadata](http://data.daff.gov.au/anrdl/metadata_files/pa_aia__r9ab\n__00211a01.xml) for more detail.\n\n",

    "description": "This polygon dataset shows the position and names of Recreational Areas within the State of Queensland. Recreational areas include: - civic Squares, gardens, golf gourses, miscellaneous areas (e.g. basketball courts, bowling clubs, caravan parks, netball courts, tennis courts, velodromes , ovals, parks, race courses, racetracks, rifle Ranges, showgrounds, zoos). This purpose of this dataset is to provide the position and names of Recreational Areas for use in Land Administration,Topographic Mapping and in the production of Navigational and Web Based Mapping applications. Additional Information: This data has been compiled from numerous sources to produce a state wide coverage with the boundaries aligned in most cases with the Queensland Digital Cadastral Database (DCDB)or captured from the best available imagery with an attribute within the data describing the source and reliability. Source data include: Queensland digital cadastral database, Queensland regional mapping, Queensland orthophotography, satellite imagery, Geoscience Australia, community and government websites. The horizontal positional accuracy of the data that has been used to compile this dataset is as follows: Orthophotography +/- 1m, Satellite Imagery +/- 2.5m. The horizontal positional accuracy of DCDB is dependent on the accuracy of the DCDB at the time of extraction.Initially for whole of state data capture, the location of the features was sourced from existing government topographic maps, regional maps and photogrammetric data. The features were validated against current orthophotography and satellite imagery and modified where necessary. The location and names of parks were extracted from the Queensland Digital Cadastral Database (DCDB). The data had been loaded into the DCDB from a \"Park and Canal Name Attribute Project\" commenced in September 1999 for data acquisition for PSMA. For golf courses, the address of the feature was sourced from the Queensland Golf Union Website. The address was then used to identify the Lot/Plan description in the DCDB that formed the extent of the feature. The features were validated against current orthophotography and satellite imagery and modified where the spatial accuracy of the DCDB was outside 25k topographic data specifications. For rifle ranges, the address of the feature was sourced from the Queensland Rifle Association Website. The address was then used to identify the Lot/Plan description in the DCDB that formed the extent of the feature. The features were validated against current orthophotography and satellite imagery and modified where the spatial accuracy of the DCDB was outside 25k topographic data specifications. For racecourses, the address of the feature was sourced from the Queensland Racing Website. The address was then used to identify the Lot/Plan description in the DCDB that formed the extent of the feature. The features were validated against current orthophotography and satellite imagery and modified where the spatial accuracy of the DCDB was outside 25k topographic data specifications. Features for ongoing data capture are sourced from government and community websites and National Park maps and their location is digitized from current orthophotography and satellite imagery. Additional data is supplied by Geoscience Australia as part of their 25K large scale data capture and commitment to the National Topographic Information Coordination Initiative (NTICI). In most cases these features have been identified through fieldwork by Geoscience Australia staff. ",

Data prior to that date were submitted to the RBA.\n\nPrior to March 2002, banks reported to APR on the _Impaired Assets Return_.\nFrom that date, banks report quarterly on _ARF 220.0: Impaired Assets_.\n\naConsolidated groupa, for a locally incorporated bank, refers to the global\noperations of the bank and its subsidiaries, excluding those involved in\ninsurance, funds management/trustee and non-financial business. For a foreign\nbank authorised to operate in Australia as a branch, the data relate to the\noperations of the branch only.\n\naTotal assetsa includes the total on-balance sheet assets reported to APR by\nlocally incorporated banks for capital adequacy purposes, and the assets of\nthe Australian bank operations of foreign bank branches.\n\naImpaired assetsa refers to the aggregate of a reporting bankas non-accrual\nand restructured exposures, both on- and off-balance sheet, plus any assets\nacquired through the enforcement of security conditions. Off-balance sheet\nexposures include, _inter alia_, commitments to provide funds that cannot be\ncancelled or revoked and the credit equivalent amounts of interest rate,\nforeign exchange and other market-related instruments.\n\naNon-accrual itemsa refers to exposures on which income may no longer be\naccrued ahead of its receipt because there is doubt about the ultimate\ncollectibility of principal and/or interest. Included are facilities where\ncontractual payments of principal and/or interest are 90 or more days in\narrears (or which have remained continuously outside approved limits for 90 or\nmore days) and the associated security is insufficient to cover payment of\nprincipal and accrued interest.\n\naRestructured itemsa refers to exposures, not classified as non-accrual, where\nthe original contractual terms have been modified to provide for concessions\nof interest or principal, for reasons related to customersa financial\ndifficulties, which render the facilities anon-commerciala to the bank.\n\naOther real estate owneda (OREO) refers to real estate acquired through\nsecurity enforcement or otherwise as settlement for outstanding obligations.\nExcluded are properties controlled under amortgagee in possessiona rights.\n\naOther assets acquireda refers to all other assets acquired through security\nenforcement or otherwise as settlement for outstanding obligations.\n\naWrite-offsa refers to the aggregate value of items written off against\nprovisions or profits during the period.\n\naPast-due itemsa refers to items that are 90 or more days in arrears but are\nwell secured and have no provisions held against them.

Both the annual mean and seasonal\npattern broadly resemble the corresponding patterns for rainfall. Canopy\ntranspiration maps have more acontrasta (relative variation) than the total\nevaporation or rainfall maps because transpiration is a small component of\ntotal evaporation in areas of low plant cover (the remainder being soil\nevaporation).The partitioning between soil evaporation and canopy\ntranspiration in the model is determined by leaf area index.Notes: These are\nmodel-based estimates from the BiosEquil model. Results are given for the\naBASEa (pre-1788) and aAGRICa (present day) conditions.

MBRC Planning Scheme will help to respond to growth and development across the Moreton Bay Region. It is a statutory document regulating how land can be used and developed. The MBRC planning scheme replaces the three previous planning schemes created by the former Caboolture, Pine Rivers and Redcliffe councils.\n\n\nPlanning schemes use zones and overlays to show the location and extent of special features that need to be considered, such as where land may be subject to hazards or other characteristics. Overlay maps may apply to all or part of your property and your property may be affected by more than one overlay. Having an overlay on your property will only affect you if you intend to develop (i.e. extent or build, change use, subdivide, clear native vegetation, fill or excavate). \nThe attribute fields are defined as per Qld Planning Provisions, Schedule 2. The Queensland Planning Provisions (QPP) are the standard planning scheme provisions made by the Minister for Planning under Chapter 2, Part 5, Division 2 and Chapter 2, Part 6 of the Sustainable Planning Act 2009.",

Data were processed using PyFluxPro (v3.4.21) as described by Isaac et al. (2017). PyFluxPro produces a final, gap-filled product with Net Ecosystem Exchange (NEE) partitioned into Gross Primary Productivity (GPP) and Ecosystem Respiration (ER).\n\n The flux station is located within an area of dryland agriculture. The surrounding area is dominated by broadacre farming practices. The vegetation cover is predominantly pasture. Elevation of the site is close to 330&nbsp;m. Climate information comes from the nearby Pingelly BoM AWS station 010626 (1991 to 2016) and shows mean annual precipitation is approximately 445&nbsp;mm with highest rainfall in June and July of 81&nbsp;mm each month. Maximumum and minuimum annual rainfall is 775 and 217&nbsp;mm, respectively. Maximum temperatures range from 31.9&nbsp;°C (in Jan) to 15.4&nbsp;°C (in July), while minimum temperatures range from 5.5&nbsp;°C (in July) to 16.0&nbsp;°C (in Feb).",
