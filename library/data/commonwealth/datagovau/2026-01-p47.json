    "description": "The West Australian Mooring Sub-Facility is part of the Australian National Mooring Network. \n\nThe Western Australia moorings sub-facility is responsible for a collection of moorings designed to monitor variability in the Leeuwin Current and continental shelf currents both in terms of along-shore and cross-shore variability. Moorings in the region also monitor processes within the Perth Canyon. The time-series monitoring of physical and biological parameters provided by these moorings supplements past and current research activities in the region based at the CSIRO, the Department of Fisheries WA and Western Australian Universities. The sub-facility currently maintains six regional moorings (two recently decommissioned) and two National Reference Stations (one recently retrieved and not redeployed).\n \nThe regional moorings are located off Perth, clustered near the Perth Canyon and the Two Rocks Line. The Two Rocks Line contains four moorings which transect the continental shelf north of Perth from the 44m to the 500m isobath (the 50m mooring was decommissioned in May 2013, and the 150m mooring in October 2013). Around the Perth Canyon, there remains one shelf mooring in shallower water at the head of the canyon, formerly two slope moorings were located near the 500m isobath (decommissioned in July 2010 and March 2014), to monitor processes in and around the canyon. Primarily these moorings are thermistor strings allowing the structure of the Leeuwin Current to be determined. Two of the moorings also sample biogeochemical parameters.",

    "title": "Victorian Land Use Information System 2016-2017",
    "description": "The Victorian Land Use Information System (VLUIS) 2016/17 dataset has been created by the Spatial Information Sciences Group of the Agriculture Victoria Research in the Department of Economic Development, Jobs, Transport, and Resources. It covers the entire landmass of Victoria and separately describes the land tenure, land use and land cover across the state at the cadastral parcel level.\n\nThe methodology for creating the VLUIS is described in Morse-McNabb et al. (2015) with the following notable changes:\n1. Land use data provided by the Office of the Valuer-General of Victoria for the 2014 year has been used as a base input. Readily available sources of land use information from government and industry have been used to provide updates to the land tenure and land use components of the 2016/17 dataset. The source dataset and source date are recorded for each parcel. The land cover mapping method remains unchanged to previous versions of the VLUIS.\n2. The Australian Land Use and Management (ALUM) Classification, version 8, has been added to the attribute table. The VLUIS land use code fields have been translated across to the ALUM classification. Version 8 has been used you can find the ALUM Classification on the Department of Agriculture and Water Resources ABARES ALUM page: http://www.agriculture.gov.au/abares/aclump/land-use/alum-classification. \n3. Land parcels within urban areas, mapped in previous versions, have been masked out and have been renamed as Built Up Areas vastly reducing the size of the 2016/17 dataset. Land cover for Built Up Areas (LC_CODE = BUILT) is listed as null.\n4. Road reserves and road parcels have been merged together and renamed Voids. Land cover for Voids (LC_CODE = VOID) is listed as null.\n5. Parcels &lt;12.5 hectares: land cover has not been attributed as the resolution of MODIS cannot support classifications of polygons smaller than 12.5 hectares.\n\nThe data is in the form of an ESRI feature class. \n\nTo use the VLUIS data correctly it is important to understand the difference between the three components of VLUIS. The Guidelines for land use mapping in Australia: principles, procedures and definitions, Edition 3 published in 2006 by the Commonwealth of Australia, defines them as follows: \nLand tenure is the form of an interest in land. Some forms of tenure (such as pastoral leases or nature conservation reserves) relate directly to land use and land management practice. \nLand use means the purpose to which the land cover is committed. Some land uses, such as agriculture, have a characteristic land cover pattern. These usually appear in land cover classifications. Other land uses, such as nature conservation, are not readily discriminated by a characteristic land cover pattern. For example, where the land cover is woodland, land use may be timber production or nature conservation. \nLand cover refers to the physical surface of the earth, including various combinations of vegetation types, soils, exposed rocks and water bodies as well as anthropogenic elements, such as agriculture and built environments. Land cover classes can usually be discriminated by characteristic patterns using remote sensing.\n\nA metadata statement, for the VLUIS product, and ESRI symbology files for the data can be freely downloaded from the VLUIS project page on the Victorian Resources Online website: http://vro.agriculture.vic.gov.au/dpi/vro/vrosite.nsf/pages/vluis\n\nDOI 10.26279/5b96043f7bd02",

    "description": "This dataset presents counts of payment recipients by payment type for the quarter ending June 2015. The data is based on the recipient's geocoded address aggregated by Statistical Area Level 2 (SA2) from the Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS) 2011.\nThe Department of Social Services (DSS) is the Australian Government's lead agency in the development and delivery of social policy, and is working to improve the lifetime wellbeing of people and families in Australia. DSS' policies and services respond to need across people's lives - looking after families, children and older people; providing a safety net for people who cannot fully support themselves; enhancing the wellbeing of people with high needs; assisting people who need help with care; and supporting a diverse and harmonious society. DSS supports people and families in Australia by encouraging independence and participation, and supporting a cohesive society.\nFor more information on this dataset please visit the Australian Government Open Data.\nFor further details on payments, see 'A guide to Australian Government payments'.\nPlease note:\n\n\nIn order to protect individuals' privacy, identified populations between 1 and 19 have been suppressed and replaced with '&lt;20' for confidentiality purposes. Additional data may be suppressed and replaced with 'n.p.' (not provided) to prevent the derivation of identified populations that have values of less than 20.\n\n\nCaveats specific to payments type can be found in the relevant payment description of the original data.\n\n\nAURIN has spatialised this dataset and have made the following replacements to enforce data type consistency: \n\n\n'&lt;20' has been assigned a value of '-1' within the data\n\n\nA boolean field has been created for each data field to flag left-censored data. 'True' is assigned to fields that have been censored.\n\n\n'n.p.' (not provided) has been set to Null within the data.\n\n",

    "description": "This data was collected in October 2009 by the IMOS Ship of Opportunity Underway CO2 Measurement research group on RV Southern Surveyor (IMOS platform code: VLHJ) voyage SS052009.\n\nDeparted: \tSydney, Australia, October 16, 2009\nArrived:  \tSydney, Australia, October 26, 2009\n\nCO2 System Overview:\nThe fugacity of carbon dioxide (fCO2) in surface seawater was measured using a General Oceanics Inc. automated system (Model 8050; Pierrot et al 2009). Seawater is sprayed into an equilibration chamber and CO2 in the headspace gas equilibrates with the seawater. The headspace gas is pumped through a thermoelectric condenser followed by a nafion drying tube before flowing through a Licor 7000 non-dispersive infrared gas analyser used to measure the CO2 mole fraction (XCO2) of the dried air. The gas flow is stopped temporarily for the CO2 measurements, which are made at atmospheric pressure. A set of four CO2 standards that cover the range of CO2 values expected in the ocean are analysed about every four hours to calibrate the gas analyser. The standard gas concentrations are on the WMO-X2007 mole fraction scale for CO2-in-air. Atmospheric XCO2 (dry) is measured after the standards by pumping clean outside air from an intake on the forward mast of the ship. \n\nSeawater intake and ancillary data:\nThe seawater intake is located at about 5.5m depth in the bow of the ship. Sea surface salinity is measured using a thermosalinograph (Seabird Electronics SBE21) located next to the CO2 system. A remote temperature sensor (Seabird Electronics SBE 38) located at the intake is used to measure sea surface temperature (SST). The travel time between the intake and CO2 system is typically about 4 minutes with warming usually less than 0.6ºC. The thermosalinograph water is from the same intake, but the supply lines separate after the intake. A comparison of thermosalinograph and equilibrator temperature records shows the temperature difference in the two lines is generally less than 0.1ºC. The thermosalinograph water line travels outside the ship and is typically warmer than the equilibrator. The travel time in water line to the thermosalinograph is 2.5 minutes faster than to the equilibrator. \n\nMeteorological data, salinity, SST, and ships position and time are taken from the ships logging system. These parameters and the data quality are maintained by the Australian Marine National Facility.",

    "description": "This dataset presents the statistics of hospitalisations with a principal diagnosis associated with chronic kidney disease excluding principal diagnosis of dialysis distributed by sex for the years between 2014-2015. The data is aggregated to 2015 Primary Health Network (PHN) geographic boundaries based on the 2011 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nThe chronic kidney disease (CKD) datasets were released by the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare (AIHW) to present data on prevalence, treatment (hospitalisations for CKD and dialysis) and deaths. It shows the distribution of the impact of CKD across Australia and visualises rates of CKD and the health and demographic profile for local areas.\nThe data was modelled by the AIHW from The National Hospital Morbidity Database (NHMD) which is compiled from data supplied by the state and territories. Hospitalisation counts are counts of admitted patient episodes of care not individual patients, and would include multiple hospitalisations experienced by the same individual if the individual had more than one hospitalisation for CKD in the given time period.\nFor further information about this dataset, please visit:\n\n\nAIHW Geographical variation in chronic kidney disease data.\n\n\nAIHW Geographical variation in chronic kidney disease report.\n\n\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data using the Department of Health - PHN Areas.\n\n\nWhere data has not been published due to small numbers, \"n.p.\" in the original data, the value has been set to null.\n\n\nWhere values have been identified to have a relative root mean square error (RRMSE), a new column has been added where \"*\" presents an RRMSE between 25% and 50%. This data should be used with caution.\n\n\nThese counts do not include home dialysis services received by patients and dialysis treatment completed in Emergency Department before their hospital admission.\n\n",

For the purposes of this report, patients presenting for family violence reasons are identified by the ‘human intent’ data item. \nAt the Emergency Department, the clinician assesses the most likely human intent. Patients presenting for family violence reasons are those that presented with a human intent injury of 'Maltreatment, assault by domestic partner' or 'Child neglect/maltreatment by parent or guardian'. The VEMD information published under the Family Violence Database (FVDB) focuses on the demographic characteristics as well as the nature and cause of their injuries of the patients presenting for family violence reasons. The FVDB only reports on family violence (FV) related patients (as indicated by the human intent data item). Therefore, when there is a reference in the FVDB to 'patients', this only includes family violence related patients presenting to a public hospital in Victoria.\nThe counting unit for the VEMD is the patient presenting at a Victorian public hospital. In the dataset there is one record per patient. However, persons can present multiple times at the emergency department and thus have multiple records in the VEMD.",

    "description": "The 2014 APS employee census was administered to all available Australian Public Service (APS) employees. This census approach provides a comprehensive view of the APS and ensures no eligible respondents are omitted from the survey sample, removing sampling bias and reducing sample error. The census' content is designed to establish the views of APS employees on workplace issues such as leadership, health and wellbeing, learning and development and job satisfaction. The census ran from 12 May to 15 June 2014. Overall, 99,392 employees responded to the employee census, a response rate of 68%. \r\n\r\nPlease be aware that the very large number of respondents to the employee census means these files are up to 200 mb in size. Downloading and opening these files may take some time. \r\n\r\n_TECHNICAL NOTES_\r\n\r\nThree files are available for download. \r\n\r\n* 2014 APS employee census - Questionnaire: This contains the 2014 APS employee census questionnaire.\r\n\r\n* 2014 APS employee census - 5 point dataset.csv: This file contains individual responses to the 2014 employee census as clean, tabular data as required by data.gov.au. This will need to be used in conjunction with the above document.\r\n \r\n* 2014 APS employee census - 5 point dataset.sav: This file contains individual responses to the 2014 employee census for use with the SPSS software package.\r\n\r\nTo protect the privacy and confidentiality of respondents to the 2014 APS employee census, the datasets provided on data.gov.au include responses to a limited number of demographic or other attribute questions.\r\n\r\nFull citation of this dataset should list the Australian Public Service Commission (APSC) as the author.  \r\n\r\nA recommended short citation is: 2014 APS employee census data, Australian Public Service Commission. \r\n\r\nAny queries can be directed to research@apsc.gov.au.",

Insufficient physical activity is defined as those aged 18-64 years who did not complete over 150 minutes of physical activity, and at least 5 sessions over a week, and those aged 65+ years who did not complete 30 minutes of activity on at least 5 days in a week. As an indication of the accuracy of estimates, 95% confidence intervals were produced.

Examples of health risk factors include risky alcohol consumption, physical inactivity and high blood pressure. High-quality information on health risk factors is important in providing an evidence base to inform health policy, program and service delivery.\nFor further information about this dataset, visit the data source: Australian Institute of Health and Welfare - Health Risk Factors in 2014-2015 Data Tables.\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data using the Department of Health - PHN Areas.\n\n\nThe health risks factors reported are known to vary with age and the different PHN area populations are known to have a range of age structures.

    "description": "This data was collected in January - February 2013 by the IMOS Ship of Opportunity Underway CO2 Measurement research group on RV Aurora Australis (IMOS platform code: VNAA) voyage AA1213V3.\n\nDeparted: \tHobart, Tasmania, January 13, 2013\nArrived:  Hobart, Tasmania,  February 22, 2013\n\nCO2 System Overview:\nThe fugacity of carbon dioxide (fCO2) in surface seawater was measured using a General Oceanics Inc. automated system (Model 8050; Pierrot et al 2009). Seawater is sprayed into an equilibration chamber and CO2 in the headspace gas equilibrates with the seawater. The headspace gas is pumped through a thermoelectric condenser followed by a nafion drying tube before flowing through a Licor 7000 non-dispersive infrared gas analyser used to measure the CO2 mole fraction (XCO2) of the dried air. The gas flow is stopped temporarily for the CO2 measurements, which are made at atmospheric pressure. A set of four CO2 standards that cover the range of CO2 values expected in the ocean are analysed about every three hours to calibrate the gas analyser.  Atmospheric XCO2 (dry) is measured after the standards by pumping clean outside air from an intake on the forward mast of the ship. \n\nSeawater intake and ancillary data:\nThe seawater intake is at about 6 m depth. A remote temperature sensor (Seabird Electronics SBE38) located at the intake is used to measure sea surface temperature (SST). Sea surface salinity is measured using a thermosalinograph (Seabird Electronics SBE21) mounted in the oceanographic lab next to the pCO2 system. The travel time between the intake and CO2 system is typically about 70 seconds with warming usually less than 0.7ºC in cold waters near freezing. The thermosalinograph water is from the same intake and supply line. \n\nMeteorological data, salinity, SST, and ships position and time are taken from the ship’s logging system.",

    "description": "The Australian Charities and Not-for-profits Commission (ACNC) is  the national regulator of charities in Australia. \r\n\r\nSince 3 December 2012,  charities wanting to access Commonwealth charity tax concessions (and other benefits), need to register with the ACNC. Although many charities choose to register, registration with the ACNC is voluntary. Each financial year, registered charities are required to lodge an Annual Information Statement (AIS) with the ACNC. \r\n\r\nGenerally, charities are required to submit their AIS within six months of the end of their reporting period – for example, by 31 December for a charity with a 30 June financial year end. \r\n\r\nThis dataset provides a record of the 2013 AISs submitted by charities, that is, the statements submitted for the 2013 reporting period. For most charities that will be for the financial year 1 July 2012 – 30 June 2013, for others it will be the 2013 calendar year. There are also a small number of charities that will have alternative particular reporting periods. \r\n\r\nFor the 2013 financial year (being the first period for reporting to the ACNC), the Commissioner exercised her discretion to extend the due date for lodgement to 31 March 2014. As at August 2014, approximately 42 000 registered charities have filed their 2013 AIS with the ACNC. The dataset is updated fortnightly.\r\n\r\nRegistered charities can apply to the ACNC to have some or all of the information they provide withheld from the [ACNC Register](www.acnc.gov.au/findacharity). There are only limited circumstances when the ACNC can agree to withhold information, including because the information:\r\n\r\n-\tis commercially sensitive and it could cause harm\r\n-\tis false, confusing or misleading\r\n-\tis offensive\r\n-\tcould endanger public safety\r\n-\tfalls within the circumstances allowed by the regulations (such as if the information identifies a private donor in relation to a private ancillary fund).\r\n\r\nSome charities have asked for their details to be withheld. If their withholding request is pending or has been approved, the AIS data relating to these charities has been excluded from this dataset.\r\n\r\nThe AIS information for individual charities can be viewed at [www.acnc.gov.au/findacharity](www.acnc.gov.au/findacharity).\r\n\r\nThe 2013 AIS dataset on data.gov.au can be used to find the AIS information lodged by more than one charity, for example for research purposes. It can also be used to filter and sort by different variables across all the AIS information that the ACNC has received for the 2013 reporting period.\r\n\r\nThe 2014 AIS will ask further questions, particularly in relation to financial information for medium and large charities. The dataset of 2014 Annual Information Statements will be uploaded to data.gov.au in due course.\r\n\r\nThe ACNC also publishes other datatsets on data.gov.au, as part of our commitment to open data and transparent regulation. Please click [here](http://www.data.gov.au/dataset?q=acnc) to view these. \r\n\r\nPLEASE NOTE: It is possible that some information in this dataset might be subject to a future request by the charity to have their information withheld, but will still appear in the dataset until the next update. Please consider this risk when using this dataset. ",

    "description": "This dataset presents the footprint of the number of closed treatment episodes for clients who seek treatment for their own drug use by principal drug of concern. A treatment episode is the period of contact between a client and a treatment provider where there are defined start (commencement) and end (cessation) dates. It is considered closed where any of the following occurs: treatment is completed or has ceased; there has been no contact between the client and treatment provider for 3 months; or there is a change in the main treatment type, principal drug of concern or delivery setting.\nThe alcohol and other drug treatment services (AODTS) data is based on data reported to the AODTS National Minimum Dataset (NMDS). The data spans the financial years of 2013-2017 and is aggregated to 2015 Department of Health Primary Health Network (PHN) areas, based on the 2011 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nThe AODTS data accompanies the Alcohol and other drug treatment services in Australia 2016-17 Report.\nFor further information about this dataset, please visit: \n\n\nAustralian Institute of Health and Welfare - AODTS Data Tables.\n\n\nAlcohol and other drug treatment services NMDS 2016-17 Quality Statement.\n\n\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data using the Department of Health - PHN Areas.\n\n\nThe PHN of the closed treatment episode was assigned based on the reported postcode of the client using the Australian Bureau of Statistics' (ABS) Postal Area 2013 to Primary Health Network 2015 concordance file. Clients with an invalid postcode were assigned to the PHN group 'PHN Unallocated' and removed from the analysis.\n\n\nTreatment episodes are excluded from the AODTS NMDS if they: are not closed in the relevant financial year; are for clients who are receiving pharmacotherapy and not receiving any other form of treatment that falls within the scope of the collection; include only activities relating to needle and syringe exchange; or are for a client aged under 10 years.\n\n",

    "description": "This dataset presents the footprint of cancer incidence statistics in Australia for all cancers combined and the 6 top cancer groupings (colorectal, leukaemia, lung, lymphoma, melanoma of the skin and pancreas) and their respective ICD-10 codes. The data spans the years 2006-2010 and is aggregated to Statistical Area Level 4 (SA4) from the 2011 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nIncidence data refer to the number of new cases of cancer diagnosed in a given time period. It does not refer to the number of people newly diagnosed (because one person can be diagnosed with more than one cancer in a year). Cancer incidence data come from the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare (AIHW) 2012 Australian Cancer Database (ACD).\nFor further information about this dataset, please visit:\n\n\nAustralian Institute of Health and Welfare - Cancer Incidence and Mortality Across Regions (CIMAR) books.\n\n\nAustralian Cancer Database 2012 Data Quality Statement.\n\n\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data.\n\n\nDue to changes in geographic classifications over time, long-term trends are not available.\n\n\nValues assigned to \"n.p.\" in the original data have been removed from the data.\n\n\nThe Australian and jurisdictional totals include people who could not be assigned a SA4. The number of people who could not be assigned a SA4 is less than 1% of the total.\n\n\nThe Australian total also includes residents of Other Territories (Cocos (Keeling) Islands, Christmas Island and Jervis Bay Territory).\n\n\nThe ACD records all primary cancers except for basal and squamous cell carcinomas of the skin (BCCs and SCCs). These cancers are not notifiable diseases and are not collected by the state and territory cancer registries.\n\n\nThe diseases coded to ICD-10 codes D45-D46, D47.1 and D47.3-D47.5, which cover most of the myelodysplastic and myeloproliferative cancers, were not considered cancer at the time the ICD-10 was first published and were not routinely registered by all Australian cancer registries. The ACD contains all cases of these cancers which were diagnosed from 1982 onwards and which have been registered but the collection is not considered complete until 2003 onwards.\n\n\nNote that the incidence data presented are for 2006-2010 because 2011 and 2012 data for NSW and ACT were not able to be provided for the 2012 ACD.\n\n",

    "description": "This data was collected in July and August 2009 by the IMOS Ship of Opportunity Underway CO2 Measurement research group on RV Southern Surveyor (IMOS platform code: VLHJ) voyage ST022009.\n\nDeparted: \tNoumea, New Caledonia, July 29, 2009\nArrived:  \tHobart, Tasmania, August 6, 2009\n\nCO2 System Overview:\nThe fugacity of carbon dioxide (fCO2) in surface seawater was measured using a General Oceanics Inc. automated system (Model 8050; Pierrot et al 2009). Seawater is sprayed into an equilibration chamber and CO2 in the headspace gas equilibrates with the seawater. The headspace gas is pumped through a thermoelectric condenser followed by a nafion drying tube before flowing through a Licor 7000 non-dispersive infrared gas analyser used to measure the CO2 mole fraction (XCO2) of the dried air. The gas flow is stopped temporarily for the CO2 measurements, which are made at atmospheric pressure. A set of four CO2 standards that cover the range of CO2 values expected in the ocean are analysed about every four hours to calibrate the gas analyser. The standard gas concentrations are on the WMO-X2007 mole fraction scale for CO2-in-air. Atmospheric XCO2 (dry) is measured after the standards by pumping clean outside air from an intake on the forward mast of the ship. \n\nSeawater intake and ancillary data:\nThe seawater intake is located at about 5.5m depth in the bow of the ship. Sea surface salinity is measured using a thermosalinograph (Seabird Electronics SBE21) located next to the CO2 system. A remote temperature sensor (Seabird Electronics SBE 38) located at the intake is used to measure sea surface temperature (SST). The travel time between the intake and CO2 system is typically about 4 minutes with warming usually less than 0.6ºC. The thermosalinograph water is from the same intake, but the supply lines separate after the intake. A comparison of thermosalinograph and equilibrator temperature records shows the temperature difference in the two lines is generally less than 0.1ºC. The thermosalinograph water line travels outside the ship and is typically warmer than the equilibrator. The travel time in water line to the thermosalinograph is 2.5 minutes faster than to the equilibrator. \n\nMeteorological data, salinity, SST, and ships position and time are taken from the ships logging system. These parameters and the data quality are maintained by the Australian Marine National Facility.",

    "description": "After nearly two years of monitoring, comprising 126.7 hours over 57 observations with the Parkes telescope and 49.4 hours across 101 observations with the FAST telescopes, we have determined that FRB 20220529 is an extremely active repeater. It exhibits one of the longest activity durations and a potential period. Due to frequent observations scheduled with both Parkes and FAST, we recently observed an abrupt rotation measure (RM) flare in this source. This is the first detection of such an <code>RM flare'' in a fast radio burst (FRB), suggesting that the source is in an environment with occasionally erupting coronal mass ejection. This presents a unique opportunity to study the eruption environment of FRBs and investigate the relation between burst activity and other burst parameters. If confirmed, the periodicity and the</code>RM flare'' of FRB 20220529 would corroborate each other and become a ``smoking gun'' of the binary origin of FRB. In our previous analysis, both Parkes and FAST observations have proven essential. While FAST's higher sensitivity has enabled the capture of many bursts, Parkes' wideband receiver has provided a good burst detection rate even during low-rate phases. Notably, during the RM flare, two high signal-to-noise ratio bursts from Parkes have been crucial in understanding the RM variations. To further investigate FRB 20220529, we have scheduled regular FAST observations every fortnight, monitoring the source for 20 minutes each time. Therefore, we also propose to monitor FRB 20220529 using the Parkes UWL receiver, ensuring high-time resolution and employing full-polarization observations.",

    "description": "This data was collected in April 2011 by the IMOS Ship of Opportunity Underway CO2 Measurement research group on RV Southern Surveyor (IMOS platform code: VLHJ) voyage SS2011_C01.\n\nDeparted: \tSydney, NSW, Apr 05, 2011\nArrived:   \t   Hobart, TAS, Apr 14, 2011\n\nCO2 System Overview:\nThe fugacity of carbon dioxide (fCO2) in surface seawater was measured using a General Oceanics Inc. automated system (Model 8050; Pierrot et al 2009). Seawater is sprayed into an equilibration chamber and CO2 in the headspace gas equilibrates with the seawater. The headspace gas is pumped through a thermoelectric condenser followed by a nafion drying tube before flowing through a Licor 7000 non-dispersive infrared gas analyser used to measure the CO2 mole fraction (XCO2) of the dried air. The gas flow is stopped temporarily for the CO2 measurements, which are made at atmospheric pressure. A set of four CO2 standards that cover the range of CO2 values expected in the ocean are analysed about every four hours to calibrate the gas analyser. The standard gas concentrations are on the WMO-X2007 mole fraction scale for CO2-in-air. Atmospheric XCO2 (dry) is measured after the standards by pumping clean outside air from an intake on the forward mast of the ship. \n\nSeawater intake and ancillary data:\nThe seawater intake is located at about 5.5m depth in the bow of the ship. Sea surface salinity is measured using a thermosalinograph (Seabird Electronics SBE21) located next to the CO2 system. A remote temperature sensor (Seabird Electronics SBE 38) located at the intake is used to measure sea surface temperature (SST). The travel time between the intake and CO2 system is typically about 4 minutes with warming usually less than 0.6ºC. The thermosalinograph water is from the same intake, but the supply lines separate after the intake. A comparison of thermosalinograph and equilibrator temperature records shows the temperature difference in the two lines is generally less than 0.1ºC. The thermosalinograph water line travels outside the ship and is typically warmer than the equilibrator. The travel time in water line to the thermosalinograph is 2.5 minutes faster than to the equilibrator. \n\nMeteorological data, salinity, SST, and ships position and time are taken from the ships logging system. These parameters and the data quality are maintained by the Australian Marine National Facility.",

Figure 1.1 shows the study area which comprises the urban part of town on the\nsouthern bank of the Cudgegong River. This area is drained by seven creeks in addition to Redbank\nCreek, which was included in the Mudgee Floodplain Management Study and Plan (Bewsher\nConsulting, 2002). That study dealt with mainstream flooding from the Cudgegong River which also\ninfluences flooding near the junctions with the creeks.\n\nThe seven creeks investigated in the present study comprise Catchments A to F and Sawpit Gully.\n\nThe Brief for the study issued by Council generally follows the scope of work required for a Floodplain\nRisk Management Study as identified in the Floodplain Development Manual (FDM, 2005). The NSW\nGovernment’s Flood Prone Land Policy and the FDM, 2005 form the basis of floodplain management\nin the State. Figure 1.2 shows the steps involved in the floodplain management planning process.\n\nThis report is <strong>Volume 1</strong> of the overall investigation and sets out the findings of the Floodplain Risk\nManagement Study and contains the draft Plan. The results of the updated flood investigations of the\nvarious creeks are presented in <strong>Volume 2</strong>.\n\n<strong>Section 2</strong> of the Study contains information on baseline flooding conditions on the floodplains,\nincluding a review of existing planning policies, assessment of the impacts of flooding on the\ncommunity, flood warning and preparedness and environmental considerations.\n\n<strong>Section 3</strong> is a review of possible Floodplain Management Measures which could be included in the\nPlan.\n\n<strong>Section 4</strong> details the selection of Floodplain Management Measures.

    "description": "This dataset comprises projected absolute values and projected changes in hillslope erosion (also referred to as sediment yield and soil loss) for all estuaries in New South Wales (NSW), Australia. Estimates were derived using the latest New South Wales and Australian Regional Climate Modelling (NARCliM2.0) climate projections. \n\nThis dataset provides the first process-based, region-wide assessment of soil availability for estuarine intertidal wetlands of NSW, complementing previous studies that focused primarily on the effects of sea-level rise (SLR). Together, these datasets provide a more comprehensive understanding of current and future trends affecting the state’s intertidal wetlands. Datasets of absolute sediment yield are provided as raster files, while differences between historical and projected epochs are supplied as vector files.\n\nHillslope erosion was estimated for each catchment using NARCliM2.0 rainfall projections within the framework of the Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE). Projected rainfall data were initially used to estimate rainfall erosivity, one of the five RUSLE parameters. The remaining parameters of the RUSLE retained their previously established values for Southern Australia (Yang, 2014; 2015; Yang et al., 2018) and include soil erodibility (K), cover management (C), slope length and steepness (LS) and the support practice (P). NARCliM2.0 projections were prepared with a 4-km spatial resolution for 2 Shared Socio-economic Pathways (SSP1-2.6 and SSP3-7.0), derived from 5 global climate models (GCMs) and downscaled to 2 regional climate models (RCMs). The GCMs include: \n<ul>\n<li>ACCESS-ESMI1-5 (CSIRO, Australia) </li>\n<li>EC-Earth3-Veg (EC-EARTH consortium, The Netherlands and Ireland) </li>\n<li>MPI–ESM1-2-HR (Max Planck Institute for Meteorology, Germany)</li>\n<li>NorESM2-MM (Norwegian Climate Center, Norway) </li>\n<li>UKESM1-0-LL (Met Office and Natural Environment Research Council, UK)</li>\n</ul>\n\nRainfall projections were interpolated to a 100-metre spatial resolution to match the remaining RUSLE factors. The absolute sediment yield values were then generated for all estuarine catchments in NSW for one historical epoch (1990–2009) and three future epochs:\n<ul>\n<li>Near Future (NF): 2020–2039</li>\n<li>Mid Future (MF): 2050–2069</li>\n<li>Far Future (FF): 2080–2099</li>\n</ul>\n\nThe historical epoch serves as the baseline, against which differences for each future epoch were calculated. These 20-year future periods were selected to capture adequate climatic variability while maintaining near-stationarity of climate variables within an epoch. \n\nTo ensure comparability, differences in sediment yield are presented as percentage change relative to the baseline using a consistent colour ramp with 18 bins (10% intervals) ranging from –80% to 80%. Differences in sediment yield increase from red (negative) to blue (positive), where red indicates projected decreases and blue indicates projected increases relative to the historical period. \n\nDetailed information on file naming conventions, raster files, and shapefile attributes is provided in the accompanying ReadMe documentation. Readers are also encouraged to refer to the accompanying scientific article (under review) for detailed information on the methodology, assumptions, and modelling procedures.",

    "description": "This identifies the land to which the LEP applies under clause 1.3 of the LEP. This is usually the whole local government area, but certain land may be excluded. The LAP dataset describes the land to which a LEP applies. Land can either be included or excluded from the LEP. Land may be excluded from the LEP due to it being a Deferred Matter, or covered by a SEPP or other planning instrument.\n The original GIS data was captured by local councils, DP&amp;I and contractors and provided in accordance with the DP&amp;I's Standard Requirements for GIS LEP data and Standard Technical Requirements for LEP maps. Before the LEP is notified on the NSW Legislation website, the mapping is checked by DP&amp;I and the Parliamentary Council's Office to ensure that it is consistent with these standards. After the LEP is notified, the GIS data is quality controlled using an ISO 9001-Quality-Certified, Quality Management System and incorporated into the Statewide dataset.\n The Land Application data relates directly to and adopts the accuracy of its reference dataset, Land and Property Information DCDB. The GIS data may be subject to change as a part of quality control, or if the LEP is amended. Please confirm dates of respective features before use as this dataset has a large temporal extent.",

This methodology assists Aerometrex to produce a seamless geo-referenced orthophotography product.Tile Size / Grid - 1km x 1km GeoTIFF TilesLimitations of DataThis dataset contains imagery which has been aero-triangulated, spatially adjusted and rectified using a digital ground surface model. The stated spatial accuracy of this product is relevant for features present at ground level only. Elevated structures (roof-tops, tree canopies, etc) will be affected by relief displacement and cannot be reliably measured from this product. Spatial accuracy is reduced in areas of dense vegetation. ",

Monitoring is carried out by three different boat-based sampling parties, but is co-ordinated to occur on the same day each month. \nAt each site, in-situ field measurements are taken using calibrated sensors for temperature, salinity, pH, dissolved oxygen and turbidity. Water clarity is also measured using a secchi disk. Surface and bottom water samples are collected for analysis of true color, total suspended solids(TSS), total  and dissolved nutrients, organic carbon and zinc. at most sites, depth integrated samples are also collected for chlorophyll a using a plastic tube. Bottom samples in the Middle and Outer estuary are collected using a niskin bottle. Pumps are used in the upper estuary site to fill up the bottles. All water samples are analysed at Analytical Service Tasmania, a National Association of Testing Authorities-accredited laboratory. Monitoring site depth is 2 meters",

    "description": "Phytoplankton and physico-chemical monitoring along the River Murray were established in 1978 under the River Murray Water Quality Monitoring Program (RMWQMP).\r\n\r\nThe phytoplankton component began with sites spread across NSW, Victoria, and SA from the NSW upper Murray to the SA Lower Lakes. With the number of sites reconciled in 1980, phytoplankton monitoring has continued at 12 sites, with 10 sites along the River Murray and 2 sites near the confluence of the main tributaries, being the Darling and Murrumbidgee rivers. \r\n\r\nBiological parameters monitored comprise phytoplankton, phycocyanin and chlorophyll-a.  For further details refer to accompanying PDF the [phytoplankton metadata statement](https://data.gov.au/data/dataset/river-murray-water-quality-monitoring-program/resource/0e0a5050-8b2f-4ce3-ab16-8b749c0a38bf).\r\n\r\nThe physico-chemical component began with 32 sites along the Murray River and various tributaries, increasing to 35 sites in 1980 then reducing to 28 sites (along with some frequency changes) in 2012.\r\n\r\nPhysico-chemical parameters monitored vary but include temperate, EC, pH, turbidity, colour, TKN, NOx, Total P, FRP, silica, DOC, bicarbonate, sulfate, and metals. The range of parameters and frequency of monitoring undertaken at a site is determined by the site class as described in Physico-chemical meta data statement.

    "description": "This record describes, and links to a working paper produced through the Resource Management in Asia-Pacific (RMAP) Program based at The Australian National University in Canberra.\n*****\nThe experience of the Fiji Locally Managed Marine Areas (FLMMA) network provides an illustration of how to mainstream community-based resource management practices that began with local communities, and were in-turn supported by a Government which has witnessed the success of community-based intervention. To improve the success of conservation in the communities and attract attention to its approach, FLMMA formed a learning portfolio. This is a network of projects that use a common strategy to achieve a common end and agree to work together to collect, test and communicate information about the conditions under which the strategy works, to enable the partners to exchange ideas and experiences. The learning portfolio enhances collaboration and also ensures that lessons learnt are shared widely with people in the network. FLMMA is working to increase the effectiveness of conservation and to ensure that the involvement of people in the management of their marine resources is both satisfying and meaningful. \n\nModern science is an important part of the FLMMA approach because it is used to demonstrate the effects of the use of traditional resource management practices. Using simple biological, social, and economic monitoring methods, the villagers are collecting impressive results on resources and habitat recovery and the associated social and economic improvements in living conditions. The objectives of improving conservation to protect biodiversity and improve people's living conditions are important features of the kind of community-based resource conservation that is now being undertaken in the Pacific and Asia region. The objectives are also consistent with national policies for inshore fisheries development and global concerns about poverty alleviation. \n\nThe success of community-based conservation in different parts of Fiji has resulted in long-term support from the communities. It has also facilitated the articulation of Government fisheries development policies. The Government has set up a new conservation unit and has formalised its support, and adopted the FLMMA method of involving local community units in the sustainable use of their marine resources. Under FLMMA, the success and combined experiences of conservation practitioners are being used to mainstream resource conservation and influence policy development in Fiji.",

    "description": "An access-restricted basemap image service that displays the latest high resolution authoritative general reference imagery datasets captured by remotely piloted aircraft systems (drones) and piloted aircraft over areas of Queensland under the Spatial Imagery Services Program  (SISP).This basemap service is designed to provide access to the latest State Remotely Sensed Image Library collection of aerial imagery captured under SISP.Basemap services comprise a single layer of static imagery optimised for display purposes. This service can be used in dynamic mode to filter and display individual project areas. The projects range from 2cm to 50cm resolution. Accuracy is dependent on the individual projects. Periodical updates will be made to the service as new projects are captured. Projects are visible at a regional scale of 1:250,000.The images comprised in each of the projects are orthorectified which removes the effects of image perspective (tilt) and relief (terrain) effects for the purpose of creating a planimetrically correct image. The resultant orthorectified images have a constant scale wherein features are represented in their “true” positions.This service supports projects captured in both GDA94 and GDA2020 datums. A Seven parameter similarity transformation has been applied to new projects that have been captured in GDA2020, this is to ensure that they align and display correctly when published in the default WGS 1984 Web Mercator (Auxiliary Sphere) projection alongside GDA94 projects.If you would like to receive updates for new projects, functionality or planned downtime please subscribe here: http://ems.gs/3qln0ijbKGR.",

It is available as a resource and reference, to assist in the future selection and planting of trees on public and private land. For more information on its use and development refer to the  Tree Species List – Development and Use Report.  The City of Sydney Tree Species List (the list) is a list of trees considered to be appropriate for planting within our local area. The list was developed with the assistance of professional arboricultural consultants, academics, landscape architects, an Indigenous consultant and experienced urban forest practitioners. It is hoped that the list will be a valuable resource and reference, to assist in the future selection and planting of trees on public and private land.  Selecting the most appropriate tree to be planted is an important process. It can be crucial to the long-term success of a landscape. To get the best results for the City or your project, the right tree must be planted in the right place, and at the right time. It can also be complicated, with many factors to be considered and balanced before arriving at a decision. The data presented in the list will help to narrow down the potential options, to arrive at tree species that are most appropriate, based on the various site conditions, the design attributes, and any personal preferences. This FAQ answers some key questions and provides a short guide to help.

Values 1 and 2 combine to form Rank 1 habitat that identifies high conservation value foraging habitat. Values 3 and 4 combine to form Rank 2 that identifies moderate conservation value foraging habitat. Rank 0 is habitat containing no foraging resources (as recognised by methodology used). Note that introduced species (e.g. mango trees) are not included in this analysis. Data also includes bi-monthly habitat scores. d_j identifies December and January. f_m identified February and March etc…\n\n•\tThe GIS mapping data were obtained to inform sustainability planning for the Lower Hunter region, particularly to assist in informing the NSW Government review of the NSW Lower Hunter regional strategy and Lower Hunter regional conservation plan.\no\tOnce this review is complete, the second stage is to undertake a strategic assessment of proposed urban development and related infrastructure corridors.

    "description": "In the Edith River area uranium occurs as meta-autunite associated with apatite and hematite in narrow siliceous reef formations which are in part brecciated and mylonized. The reefs, which dip steeply west and strike mostly north-north-west, occur over a length of about 3 miles in a north-south, sheared greisenized, zone in granite. Two main types of granite are present, a coarse grained granite and a finer-grained adamellite, which is intrusive into the coarse granite. In places partial digestion of the coarse by the fine granite has produced a porphyritic \"hybrid\" granite. All granites except the greisenized granite of the sheared zone give high background counts, 2 to 3 times as high as that of the sediments of the Brocks Creek group into which the coarse granite is intrusive. Within the reef formations the distribution of uranium-bearing material is patchy. In many places the best geiger readings are obtained where cross reefs or fractures with a north easterly strike cut the main reefs. Surface samples were taken across most places where significant Geiger readings were obtained and all returned less than .1% U3O8. Commercial production from the field will only be possible if the grade of the original ore has been greatly affected by surface leaching and a site was selected for a shaft to test the primary ore.",

    "description": "Snow data is sourced from each of the resorts, using data collected each morning by on-mountain staff. The measuring of natural snow depths is done at up to four gauge locations (snow plots) at the resorts. From these locations an average overall depth is ascertained, as well as an average 24hr snowfall. The average depth in snow-making areas is calculated from depths taken from probing the areas where snow-making occurs.\nNotwithstanding that all Victorian alpine resorts (other than Mount Stirling) routinely make snow during the season when the conditions are suitable, snow depth in snow-making areas may not be reported in cases where only limited ski lift accessible terrain is open, particularly early or late in the season.\nIn addition, during the season, when there is an abundance of natural snow, accurate snow depth measurements in snow-making areas may not have been recorded. Rather, snow depth in snow-making areas may have been assumed to be equal to natural snow depth or may have been recorded as exceeding the reported snow depth (e.g. 146cm+). This means that recorded snow depths in snow-making areas, may be less than the actual snow depths in snow-making areas.\nIn addition the snow reporting service ceases when resort operations cease, be that before or at the official end of the snow season. As a consequence, no snow depths are reported subsequently, notwithstanding that significant snow depth may remain.",

    "description": "The Climate Science Initiative (CSI) State temperature projection 20km bias corrected dataset has been produced as part of the Climate Science Initiative program. This dataset contains maximum temperature projections.\n\nClimate projection data is available at a 20-kilometre resolution representing the monthly average maximum near-surface air temperature (at 2m) for annual and seasonal time slices (Summer, Autumn, Winter, Spring) over 5 time periods including:\n\n•   Baseline (1990-2009)\n\n•   2030 (2020-2039)\n\n•   2050 (2040-2059)\n\n•   2070 (2060-2079)\n\n•   2090 (2080-2099)\n\nProjections represent two emissions scenarios, SSP1-2.6 (a ‘low’ emissions scenario) and SSP3-7.0 (a ‘high’ emissions scenario). The results are presented as a mean, minimum and maximum result of the NSW and Australian Regional Climate Modelling (NARCliM) ensemble (representing 10 Global Climate Model results) for each gridded point, as well as a standard deviation to reveal the statistical range between model results.\n\nRelative change files (difference between the future and baseline prediction) are also available for each of the calculations i.e. annual and seasonal mean, standard deviation, minimum, maximum. \nThe data is bias corrected, and users are encouraged to read the CSI technical fact sheet for further information on this, and data limitations. It also includes background information on the project and datasets, explanations of technical terms such as Global Climate Models (GCMs), Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs) and further information about the projections. It also contains important advice regarding using the data appropriately.  \n\nFuture updates to this dataset may include regional and global climate model specific data at a 4-kilometre resolution, as well as a third ‘middle of the road’ scenario (SSP2-4.5). \n\nThe data naming protocol is outlined in the technical information factsheet available under Data and Resources. \n\n•   Frequently asked questions - https://www.wa.gov.au/service/environment/environment-information-services/climate-science-initiative-frequently-asked-questions\n\n•   Climate Science Initiative - https://www.wa.gov.au/organisation/department-of-water-and-environmental-regulation/climate-science-initiative",

    "description": "A CYG area is an area or precinct where EPA knows groundwater has been contaminated by:\n    • an activity\n    • waste\n    • pollution\n    • contaminated land.\nCYG areas are where contaminant levels threaten one or more environmental values.\nThe groundwater in a CYG area may not be suitable for some uses. It may be harmful to human health and the environment.\nIt's important for anyone who wants to use groundwater in CYG areas to test it to make sure it's safe to use.\nEach CYG area has a status to help you understand how much groundwater investigation and clean-up has been done.\nEPA assigns a CYG area one of 3 statuses:\n    1. Post remediation – clean-up of groundwater has been done, but some groundwater contamination remains. All former groundwater quality restricted use zones (GQRUZs) have this status.\n    2. Under assessment – further monitoring, evaluation and/or remediation of the groundwater is expected.\n    3. Precinct – the source of groundwater contamination is not clear. There's evidence it comes from multiple sites. Clean-up of the groundwater cannot be effectively completed.\nWhen a particular area is not captured by a CYG area, it does not mean that the groundwater there is suitable for use. The groundwater may not have been tested. Every effort has been made to ensure the accuracy of the CYG area data published. EPA will not be held liable or responsible for any errors, or for any loss incurred from reliance on this data. For further information about a particular CYG area, refer to the accompanying assessment report (where available) or contact EPA.",

We apply recently-developed statistical methods to a novel dataset, compiled from Australia's national account statistics and farm surveys. \r\n\r\n The results show agricultural productivity grew at 2.0 per cent a year between 1948-49 and 2013-14. This work provides a unique measure of the productivity performance of Australia's agriculture industry over time, and thereby provides insight into trends in farm performance and the effects of policy reforms.",

    "description": "This dataset presents the footprint of the percentage of women who had an episiotomy when giving birth for the first time and giving birth vaginally and non-instrumentally, by the mother's usual residence. This has been calculated with the number of females having their first baby who had an episiotomy during a non-instrumental vaginal birth, divided by the number of females having their first baby who gave birth vaginally and had a non-instrumental vaginal birth, and multiplied by 100. The data spans the years of 2012-2016 and is aggregated to 2015 Department of Health Primary Health Network (PHN) areas, based on the 2011 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nThe data is sourced from the National Perinatal Data Collection (NPDC), which is a national population-based cross-sectional collection of data on pregnancy and childbirth. The data are based on births reported to the perinatal data collection in each state and territory in Australia. Midwives and other birth attendants, using information obtained from mothers and from hospital or other records, complete notification forms for each birth. A standard de-identified extract is provided to the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare (AIHW) on an annual basis to form the NPDC.\nFor further information about this dataset, please visit:\n\n\nAustralian Institute of Health and Welfare - National Core Maternity Indicators Data Tables.\n\n\nMetadata Online Registry Entry.\n\n\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data using the Department of Health - PHN Areas.\n\n\nA birth is defined as an event in which a baby comes out of the uterus after a pregnancy of at least 20 weeks gestation or weighing 400 grams or more.\n\n\nIncluded are those females who gave birth for the first time and had a vaginal birth, with or without instruments. Females who had a multiple birth are included if this was the first time they had given birth.\n\n\nExcluded are those females who did not give birth for the first time or gave birth by caesarean section.\n\n\nNon-instrumental vaginal births include spontaneous vaginal and vaginal breech.\n\n\nCaution should be used when interpreting these results. There was no standardised collection across jurisdictions for the data used to derive this indicator.\n\n\nFor multiple births, the perineal status after the birth of the first-born baby was used.\n\n\nFrom 2004 to 2013, a combined laceration and episiotomy value could be recorded; from 2014 onwards, episiotomy could be recorded separately.\n\n\nData were not available from Victoria for 2009.\n\n\nThe sum of the reported 'Grouped by' values may not equal the Australia total.\n\n",

    "description": "This dataset shows land parcels owned by Melbourne Water that have potential to be utilised for liveability related projects. The data does not provide a guarantee that the land can be used, or used by any particular activity. Authority to use the land will still need to be assessed and granted by Melbourne Water. Due to the restrictive nature of potentially using land containing assets such as pipes, pits, retarding basins etc the land has been classified into three landuse types. These types describe the potential for using the land area for different purposes. Land classified as \"A\" (or \"Likely Available\") are those area that are likely to be available for community projects and could be used for a variety of purposes depending on the space. Land classified as \"L\" (or \"Restrictions Apply\") are areas likely to be available for small scale or portable infrastructure such as park benches, goal posts, landscaping and temporary food vans. They are unlikely to be available for large scale infrastructure due to access, drainage, safety, current lease or licence agreements or other requirements. Land classified as \"X\" (or \"Access Only\") are areas likely to be available for access related activities such as walking, running or yoga. 24 hour access is usually required and infrastructure is unlikely to be permitted. To apply, visit: Our Space Your PlaceApproximately 100 Melbourne Water asset datasets were used in the creation of this dataset. Rules governing the use of land on and around each asset class were established and applied to these areas. Coverage is across approximately 80% of MW owned land areas. The next edition aims to increase this to all applicable MW owned land.For more details: Land and Community Projects (link to MW website)NOTE: Whilst every effort has been taken in collecting, validating and providing the attached data, Melbourne Water Corporation makes no representations or guarantees as to the accuracy or completeness of this data.

    "description": "This dataset is a sample of the Heat Health Vulnerability Index (HHVI) from the Australian Urban Health Indicators (AusUrb-HI) project. It includes all SA1s within a single SA2 region in New South Wales (NSW).\nThis dataset provides a spatial indicator of population vulnerability to extreme heat at the Statistical Area Level 1 (SA1), developed as part of the Heat Health Vulnerability case study within the AusUrb-HI project. The indicator captures three dimensions of vulnerability: exposure, sensitivity, and adaptive capacity. It integrates demographic profiles, environmental conditions, and urban morphology to map areas most at risk of heat-related health impacts.\nThe AusUrb-HI project, led by AURIN, brings together expertise from QUT, RMIT, and UWA. It aims to enhance the understanding of urban health through spatial data assets across three themes: Cancer Determinants, Heat Health Vulnerability, and Urban Liveability &amp; Health. These indicators are designed to inform health professionals, planners, and policymakers in delivering targeted, climate-sensitive strategies to improve health and resilience in urban environments.\nThis dataset focuses on the NSW case study area, where linked hospital admissions data enabled validation of the HHVI. The index was developed using principal component analysis (PCA) on up to 44 input variables, with results produced for both the 2016 and 2021 census years. Multiple downscaling methods were tested, showing high internal consistency and strong correlation with the Australian Bureau of Statistics' Index of Relative Socio-economic Disadvantage (IRSD).\nThe linked health data used for validation was accessed through the Centre for Health Record Linkage (CHeReL) and analyzed in the Secure Unified Research Environment (SURE).\nThis dataset is intended to support evidence-based planning for climate resilience and public health. Each record includes values for exposure, sensitivity, adaptive capacity, and the combined index, along with variables used to derive these indices.",

    "description": "In Western Australia, the Public Sector Commission's purpose is to bring leadership and expertise to the public sector to enhance integrity, effectiveness and efficiency. The Commission’s vision is of a high performing public sector serving the needs of the State now and into the future.\r\n\r\nIn accordance with section 22D of the Public Sector Management Act 1994, the Public Sector Commissioner reports annually to Parliament on the state of public sector administration and management, and on the extent of compliance with public sector standards and ethical codes. One of the primary information sources used for the State of the sector report is the annual agency survey (AAS). \r\n\r\nThe 2013 AAS collected information on the application of [Commissioner’s Instruction No. 7 – Code of Ethics](http://www.publicsector.wa.gov.au/document/commissioners-instruction-no-7-%E2%80%93-code-ethics), agency codes of conduct and general principles of human resource management and public interest disclosure at June 2013 or for the 2012/13 financial year. The survey was sent to chief executive officers (CEOs) and chief employees of all public sector entities, including Senior Executive Service (SES) organisations, non-SES organisations and departments of state. \r\n\r\nIn 2013, all 110 public sector entities completed the survey.\r\n\r\nThree files are available for download on data.gov.au:\r\n\r\n1)    AAS 2013.pdf – the survey instrument sent to relevant entities to access online\r\n\r\n2)    Public Sector Commission AAS 2013 data.xls – individual agency responses to the AAS, with a question key and response key. Please note some variables have been removed to simplify the dataset. \r\n\r\n3)    Public Sector Commission AAS 2013 data.sav – individual agency responses to the AAS, in .sav format to be used with SPSS. Please note some variables have been removed to simplify the dataset. \r\n\r\n\r\nFurther information and a summary of AAS data is available in the [State of the sector statistical bulletin](http://www.publicsector.wa.gov.au/document/state-sector-statistical-bulletin-2013). \r\n",

This data contains observation data made by Parks employees during their research of the crazy ant colonies on Christmas Island in 2001. \nEach of the points represents a surveyed crazy ant site in 2001.  Using field methods (e.g. number of ants running across a sheet of paper), Parks employees estimated the concentration of ants at each site. The results were then represented as total ants and incorporated into the shapefile ‘crazyant_grid.shp’. \nIn September 2003, Geoscience Australia projected the Crazy Ants shapefiles to the MGA (GDA94) projection using an XY shift (X=550015, Y=8780001).\nDisclaimer",

    "description": "The digital State Boundaries and their legal identifiers have been derived from the cadastre data from each state and territory jurisdiction and are available below.\r\n\r\nState Boundaries are part of Geoscape Administrative Boundaries, which is built and maintained by  [Geoscape Australia](https://geoscape.com.au/) using authoritative government data. Further information about contributors to Administrative Boundaries is available [here](https://geoscape.com.au/legal/data-copyright-and-disclaimer/).\r\n\r\nThe full Administrative Boundaries dataset contains boundaries in seven themes: Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) boundaries, electoral boundaries, state and territory boundaries, local government areas, suburbs/localities, wards and town points.\r\n\r\nAs at November 2019, users have the option to download datasets with feature coordinates referencing the new Geocentric Datum of Australia 2020 (GDA2020) in addition to datasets on the GDA94 datum.\r\n\r\nFor GDA2020 datasets, the name of the zip folder and the root folder (once extracted) include a reference to GDA2020. For GDA94 datasets, the zip and root folder names do not contain the datum name (i.e. they remain the same as previous releases).\r\n\r\nFor example, the zip and root folder for Administrative Boundaries downloaded in GDA2020 for November 2019 looks like this:\r\n\r\n       •\tNOV19_AdminBounds_ESRIShapefileorDBFfile_GDA2020; or \r\n       •\tNOV19_AdminBounds_MapInfoTABFormat_GDA2020\r\n\r\nThe zip and root folder for Administrative Boundaries in GDA94 for November 2019 looks like this: \r\n\r\n       •\tNOV19_AdminBounds_ESRIShapefileorDBFfile; or \r\n       •\tNOV19_AdminBounds_MapInfoTABFormat\r\n\r\nIrrespective of the datum chosen, files within the respective folder use exactly the same naming structures.\r\n\r\nFurther information on Administrative Boundaries, including FAQs on the data, is available [here](https://geoscape.com.au/data/administrative-boundaries/) through Geoscape Australia’s network of [partners](https://geoscape.com.au/partners/). They provide a range of commercial products based on Administrative Boundaries, including software solutions, consultancy and support.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## License Information\r\n\r\nThe Australian Government has negotiated the release of Administrative Boundaries to the whole economy under an [open CCBY 4.0 license](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).\r\n\r\nUsers must only use the data in ways that are consistent with the Australian Privacy Principles issued under the Privacy Act 1988 (Cth).\r\n\r\n**Users must also note the following attribution requirements:**\r\n\r\n_Preferred attribution for the Licensed Material:_\r\n\r\n> _Administrative Boundaries © [Geoscape Australia](https://geoscape.com.au/legal/data-copyright-and-disclaimer/) licensed by the Commonwealth of Australia under_ [_Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International licence (CC BY 4.0)_](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).\r\n\r\n_Preferred attribution for Adapted Material:_\r\n\r\n> _Incorporates or developed using Administrative Boundaries © [Geoscape Australia](https://geoscape.com.au/legal/data-copyright-and-disclaimer/) licensed by the Commonwealth of Australia under_ [_Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International licence (CC BY 4.0)_](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).",

    "description": "This dataset presents the footprint of the number of installations of small generation unit (SGU) wind systems and their rated output in kilowatts (kW). The data spans the months of 2006 and includes the total for the year. The data is aggregated to Postal Areas (POAs) from the 2016 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nEvery month the Clean Energy Regulator (CER) publishes small-scale renewable energy installation data files. These data files provide a list of SGU (small-scale solar panel, wind and hydro systems) and kW capacity by installed postcode, and solar water heaters (SWH) and air source heat pumps by installed postcode. The data represents all systems that have had certificates validly created against them. The data includes new installations, upgrades to existing systems and stand-alone (off-grid) systems. This data is not publicly available via the Renewable Energy Certificate (REC) Registry and does not include systems that are pending registration or have been failed by the CER.\nFor further information about this dataset, visit the data source:Clean Energy Regulator - Postcode Data for Small-scale Installations.\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data by joining the data with the 2016 ASGS POAs\n\n\nMonthly installation data is provided for months where an installation was registered.\n\n\nThe data is current as at 30-09-2018.\n\n\nRenewable Energy Target (RET) legislation allows a 12 month creation period for registered persons to create their certificates.\n\n\nSmall-scale technology certificates are calculated based on the life of the system. This differs for solar hot water heaters and small generation units (solar panels, wind and hydro). Further information can be found at theRenewable Energy Target FAQ.\n\n\nCapacity data has been revised to account for past data entry errors which caused significant inconsistencies. These systems were installed between 2001 and 2003. As a result of this revision, the cumulative installed capacity from 2004 onwards has reduced by 5.517MW.\n\n",
