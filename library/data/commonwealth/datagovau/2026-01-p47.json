    "description": "Data were collected as part of the FutureReef MAP project, a three-year project designed to monitor ocean chemistry along the entire length of the Great Barrier Reef. The Future Reef MAP project is funded by Rio Tinto Alcan and administered by the Great Barrier Reef Foundation, with an equal co-investment by CSIRO. The project is the first large-scale CO2 observing system established on the Great Barrier Reef using the Rio Tinto ship, RTM Wakmatha. The research is targeted at providing information on the CO2 uptake and the controls on ocean acidification change in the region. It is providing foundation data needed to assess the vulnerability of the GBR reefs to ocean acidification. This dataset contains quality controlled underway measurements of the fugacity of CO2, atmospheric pressure, and sea surface temperature and salinity. The data management and distribution of these data were supported by the CSIRO Carbon Collaboration Cluster and the Australian Coastal Ecosystem Facility.",

    "description": "Human activities in coastal landscapes also exert both direct and indirect pressures on blue carbon (McLeod et al., 2011). Rogers et al. (2019) accounted for this pressure using land-use mapping, with the premise being that natural landscapes are more compatible with storage, preservation, and generation of blue carbon, whilst intensive land-use activities are less compatible. They proposed that this approach partly accounts for socio-economic factors that influence blue carbon. In this study, 2017 land-use mapping was reclassified based on perceived present-day compatibility with blue carbon to generate a blue carbon compatibility (BCC) raster dataset.\nMcLeod, E., Chmura, G.L., Bouillon, S., Salm, R., Björk, M., Duarte, C.M., Lovelock, C.E., Schlesinger, W.H., and Silliman, B.R.

The infrastructure consists of a base station mounted on the existing reef communications tower and a single buoy which carries the actual sensors.\n\nMyrmidon Reef is on the edge of the continetial shelf and so the station is designed to measure upwelling of water from the slope coming up and onto the continential shelf. The station is linked to stations at Rib Reef (mid-shelf) and Orpheus Island (inshore) to track upwelling water across the shelf.",

    "description": "Overview  \r\n\r\n The beef sectors of Brazil, Argentina, Uruguay and Paraguay have grown significantly over the past two decades. This report profiles the beef industries of these four beef exporting South American nations, as well as Australia, and evaluates the trends and key factors behind the growth in real export values since 2000. Forward looking scenario analysis based on actual and hypothetical changes to policies and operating environments is undertaken to assess the potential impacts on Australia's future beef exports. \r\n\r\n Key issues  \r\n\r\n Global demand for beef is expected to expand significantly over the next several decades, especially in Asia, which will present opportunities for exporters. \r\n\r\n Australia and South America, together, account for almost half of world trade in beef. \r\n\r\n South America is emerging as a significant competitor for the Australian beef industry, as market access to Australia's traditional markets is improving. \r\n\r\n For the five beef exporting countries profiled in this report, improved market access was the main driver of real export revenue growth (in 2000 US dollar terms) between 2000 and 2014. Other contributing drivers include changes in export supply costs, exchange rate movements and growth in demand for beef. \r\n\r\n Three forward-looking scenarios assess the potential change to export growth from 2014 to 2030 from changes in domestic and international operating environments. These include: the removal of Argentine agricultural export requirements; improved market access for South American beef; and improvements in transport infrastructure for Brazil and Australia. \r\n\r\n To maintain its export competitiveness, Australia will need to: 1. improve productivity growth both on and off the farm \r\n2. continue to target premium markets and improve market access in order to be responsive to changes in the market \r\n3. maintain a production system that ensures its status as a clean and green beef producer so that it will be able to distinguish itself on quality when it cannot compete on price with lower-cost exporters. \r\n",

The Commission’s vision is of a high performing public sector serving the needs of the State now and into the future.\r\n\r\nIn accordance with section 22(1) of the Public Interest Disclosure Act 2003, the Public Sector Commissioner reports annually to Parliament on the compliance of public authorities with the Act. In 2014, this was reported in the State of the WA public sector 2014 - Measuring up.\r\n\r\nThe 2014 PID survey collected information on public interest disclosures received during the 2013/14 financial year, and activities undertaken to comply with the PID Act. The survey was sent to chief employees of all public authorities, including public sector entities, local governments, public universities, other entities listed in Schedule 1 of the Public Sector Management Act 1994 (PSM Act), and government boards and committees. The PID survey questions are incorporated in the public sector entity survey for public sector entities (Senior Executive Service (SES) organisations, non-SES organisations and departments of state) with more than 20 staff.\r\n\r\nIn 2014, 86 entities completed the public sector entity survey and 245 authorities completed the PID survey (24 public sector entities with less than 20 staff, 68 government boards and committees, 128 local governments, 4 public universities and 21 other Schedule 1 PSM Act entities).\r\n\r\nTwo files are available for download on data.gov.au:\r\n\r\n1)    Public Sector Commission PID survey 2014 data.xls – individual authority responses to the PID survey with a question key and response key. \r\n\r\n2)    Public Sector Commission PID survey 2014 data.sav – individual authority responses to the PID survey, in .sav format to be used with SPSS. \r\n\r\nFurther information and a summary of PID survey data is available in the State of the WA public sector 2014 - Measuring up. \r\n",

    "description": "Data represents vegetation coverage within the riparian zone for waterways across Melbourne Water’s region. This layer was developed by GraceGIS as part of vegetation statistics extraction for each riparian zone and stream bed for each of the subcatchments. The data was developed as part of the Healthy Waterways Strategy 2018 (HWS2018). The primary purpose of this layer is for reporting and target setting. This includes setting and reporting on targets and performance objectives relating to vegetation coverage.Dataset was created using 1. Latest MW Drainage Network to prepare HWS stream network layer. 2. Seamless polygons were created for the stream bed: ISC 2010 streambed data and a 2 metre buffer from the network was used to develop a complete streambed layer across the Melbourne Water region. 3. Buffer polygons at 20 metres and 10 metres from the streambed representing riparian zone outside Urban Growth Boundary (UGB) area and within UGB respectively. 4. HWS Vegetation Streambed Riparian (2016) layer for these riparian and stream beds has been assembled. 5. Subc level stats are derived as detailed above.Attribute level metadata can be viewed hereNOTE: Whilst every effort has been taken in collecting, validating and providing the attached data, Melbourne Water Corporation makes no representations or guarantees as to the accuracy or completeness of this data.

    "description": "This dataset presents the estimates of the internal and overseas migration statistics of Australia by age by Greater Capital City Statistical Area (GCCSA) following the 2016 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS). The dataset spans from the 2016-17 financial year up to the 2019-20 financial year.\nOverseas migration is the movement of people from overseas to Australia's sub-state areas and vice-versa.  It cannot be directly measured and is estimated by breaking down overseas migrant arrivals and departures at the state level to sub-state areas, using information from the most recent Census. The state-level overseas migration data is sourced from Department of Home Affairs processing systems, visa information, and incoming passenger cards, and is published in National, state and territory population.\nInternal migration is the movement of people across a specified boundary within Australia involving a change in place of usual residence. It cannot be directly measured and is instead estimated using administrative data. The movement of people between and within Australia's states and territories cannot be directly measured and is estimated using administrative data. Internal migration is estimated based on a combination of Census data (usual address one year ago), Medicare change of address data (provided by Services Australia), and Department of Defence records (for military personnel only). \nThe Medicare source data is assigned to a state or territory and GCCSA for a person's departure and arrival locations, based on the postcodes of their residential addresses as registered with Medicare. Postcodes are assigned wholly to a state/territory and GCCSA based on best fit. Where a postcode is split across areas, it is assigned to the area that contains the majority of that postcode's population.\nFor more information please visit the Regional population methodology.\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data.",

    "title": "Groundwater use of riparian vegetation along Cooper Creek",
    "description": "\n## **Abstract** \nThis dataset was compiled by the Geological and Bioregional Assessment Program from source data referenced within the dataset and/or metadata. The processes undertaken to produce this derived dataset are described in the History field in this metadata statement. This investigation sought to investigate the water balance of the alluvium of the Cooper Creek using the actual evapotranspiration from MODIS-Landsat blended CMRSET. Previous research has shown that the river red gum and coolibah trees in the riparian zone are using both soil moisture and groundwater, whereas the rest of the floodplain vegetation is limited to using soil moisture fed from rainfall and overbank flooding. This allows us to classify areas based on their actual evapotranspiration and therefore water sources: open water > riparian areas > floodplain > rain fed areas. Transmission losses are very high in Cooper Creek with 81% of the water flowing into the system from the Barcoo and Thompson rivers lost by the time it reaches the Qld/SA border. This water is either lost to the floodplain through overbank flooding or to groundwater recharge. There is no regional freshwater resource and the freshwater lenses around waterholes are consumed by the riparian vegetation within hundreds of metres of the waterholes. Using the remotely sensed actual evapotranspiration data enables vegetation water use to be split by water source. For the period 2000-2018, 77% of water lost from Cooper Creek was lost to the floodplain where it supports the pasture growth critical to the pastoral industry. The remaining 23% was lost to evapotranspiration by the riparian vegetation or as open water evaporation in waterholes. The waterholes act as recharge features of the landscape while Cooper Creek is in flood, through scouring of the bed of the channels, and then self-seal when the velocity of the flow decreases. When sealed, there is no leakage to groundwater. Local-scale recharge can be inferred for each waterhole using a groundwater balance based on transpiration of groundwater from the riparian zone vegetation. Of the 80 waterholes that hold water more than 95% of the time, the calculated recharge rate was between 130 and 970 mm/year over the area of the waterhole. These recharge estimates suggest recharge occurs through the bed of the channels, as well as from the waterholes, the area-weighted average recharge rate for these 80 waterholes was 260 mm/year. \n\n\n## **Attribution** \nGeological and Bioregional Assessment Program\n\n\n## **History** \nThe Lineage field lists the parents of this dataset. The steps involved in creating this dataset were: (1) classify annual evapotranspiration dataset into four classes based on the magnitude of the AET - Open water > riparian vegetation > floodplain vegetation > dryland areas; (2) calculate the mode of the classified landscape class from the 18 years of data (classed_AET_TS_ann_mode_clipped_FP.tif); (3) calculate the number of times a pixel was classified as riparian vegetation (sumrip.tif); (4) calculate a water balance at the landscape scale (WB at landscape scale.xls); and (5) calculate a water balance at the scale of a waterhole (WB at waterhole scale.xls). More information on how this dataset was created can be found in the journal paper: \r\nCrosbie RS, Holland KL and McVicar TR (in prep) Actual evapotranspiration in the Cooper Creek floodplain: transmission losses and groundwater recharge.

    "description": "A study of the response of phytoplankton to rainfall in Sydney Harbour, on the 29th of October 2004, is reported here. Sydney Harbour is an important port and recreational region for the city of Sydney. Phytoplankton can be used as one of the indexes of water quality. The concentration of phytoplankton is influenced by the nutrients in the water and the amount of nutrients is thought to alter according to the urban and industrial wastes that drain from the city of Sydney.    \nThe amount of phytoplankton before and after rainfall at Pyrmont in Sydney Harbour was observed. The concentration of chlorophyll after a period of rainfall from the 15th October to the 4th of November 2004, as measured from the surface to 7m deep, was almost 5 times as much as that as before the rain event. The maximum chlorophyll concentration observed by fluorometer was 27 [ug/litre].",

    "description": "The Hydrogeological Landscape (HGL) concept provides a structure for the understanding of how salinity manifests itself in the landscape and how differences in salinity are expressed across the landscape. A HGL spatially defines areas of similar salt stores and pathways for salt mobilisation. The process of HGL determination relies on the integration of a number of factors: geology, soils, slope, regolith depth, and climate; an understanding of the differences in salinity development; and the impacts (land salinity/salt load/water electrical conductivity) in landscapes. Information sources such as soils maps, site characterisation, salinity site mapping, hydrogeological conditions and surface and groundwater data are combined to develop standard templates for each HGL. The focus of this package is the Goulburn Study Area. It comprises four volumes - Volume 1: project background, regional setting, methodologies, interpretations, conclusions, glossary and references; Volume 2: HGL templates, and information associated with the use of the HGL templates; Volume 3: maps and digital spatial data developed for the project, including derivative maps to assist in land management decision making; and Volume 4: background information relevant to land management for rural and urban salinity in the Goulburn Study Area. This includes information on salinity management from the perspectives of land use design, scales and types of management, landscape function, management strategies, actions and outcomes, as well as land use to be avoided.\n\nSpatial resolution for this product is 1:100 000.",

    "description": "This dataset presents the footprint of the percentage of selected women who gave birth for the first time and who had labour induced. This has been calculated with the number of selected females who gave birth for the first time and who had labour induced, divided by all selected females, and multiplied by 100. The data spans the years of 2014-2016 and is aggregated to Statistical Area Level 3 (SA3) geographic areas from the 2011 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nWomen included are those who gave birth for the first time and met all of the following criteria:\n\n\nAged between 20 and 34.\n\n\nGestational age at birth between 37 and 41 completed weeks.\n\n\nPregnancy has one baby only (singleton).\n\n\nThe presentation of the baby is vertex (baby's head was at the cervix).\n\n\nThe data is sourced from the National Perinatal Data Collection (NPDC), which is a national population-based cross-sectional collection of data on pregnancy and childbirth. The data are based on births reported to the perinatal data collection in each state and territory in Australia. Midwives and other birth attendants, using information obtained from mothers and from hospital or other records, complete notification forms for each birth. A standard de-identified extract is provided to the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare (AIHW) on an annual basis to form the NPDC.\nFor further information about this dataset, please visit:\n\n\nAustralian Institute of Health and Welfare - National Core Maternity Indicators Data Tables.\n\n\nMetadata Online Registry Entry.\n\n\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data.\n\n\nA birth is defined as an event in which a baby comes out of the uterus after a pregnancy of at least 20 weeks gestation or weighing 400 grams or more.\n\n\nInduction of labour is a set of procedures (pharmacological and/or instrumental) to start the uterus contracting and begin the process of labour.\n\n\nGestational age is a clinical measure of the duration of the pregnancy. For the NPDC gestational age is reported as completed weeks.\n\n\nData for selected women criteria, parity, were not available from Victoria for 2009.\n\n\nData for Tasmania from 2004 to 2012 were not available.

    "description": "We undertook a biological data acquisition program as part of the transit of the R.V. Southern Surveyor between Darwin and Cairns 15-24 October 2012. The overarching aim of this program was to use an ROV and benthic sled to collect benthic marine information and specimens for biodiversity and biodiscovery research in areas previously mapped by Geoscience Australia during survey GA-276, including a bank (Area I) and terrace/hole feature within the proposed Wessel Islands CMR (Area II). This study focuses on sessile invertebrates such as sponges and octocorals due to their ecological importance as habitat providers and their chemical importance as sources of marine natural products and medicines.\n\nIn less than 24 hours of sampling effort, survey SS2012/t07 resulted in 261 voucher specimens which will be used for biodiversity and natural products research.  A total of 49 samples are to be lodged at the ABL, and samples with weights larger than 300 g will be sent to the NCI for screening of active compounds against cancer and HIV. Sponges were the most abundant group collected based on both biomass (~ 139 kg) and number of voucher specimens (93),  followed by cnidarians (30 kg, 73 vouchers), particularly hard corals (23 kg, 11 vouchers). As expected the top of the bank in Area I had a seemingly diverse and abundant sessile invertebrate community, with consistent patchy occurrence of sponges, octocorals, and hard corals. The terrace at in Area II supports moderate densities of sponges and octocorals, while the adjacent deep hole at ~ 100 m seems to be covered with muddy gravel and supports scattered mobile and sedentary invertebrates, of which crinoids dominate, as well as skates and numerous small demersal fish.\n\nYou can also purchase hard copies of Geoscience Australia data and other products at http://www.ga.gov.au/products-services/how-to-order-products/sales-centre.html",

    "description": "This dataset presents the number of distinct specialist homeless services clients by client type, sex and age group. The client counts are based on the location where the client resided in the week before their first support period in the financial year. Each client contributes only once, even if they had multiple support periods during the financial year. The data spans the financial years of 2014-15 to 2018-19 and is aggregated to 2016 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS) Statistical Area Level 3 (SA3).\nThe Specialist Homelessness Services Collection (SHSC) data accompanies the Specialist Homelessness Services Annual Report 2018-19.\nFor further information about this dataset, visit the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare - SHSC Data Cubes User Guide.\nNotes:\n\n\nCaution should be used when comparing data for 2017-18 onwards with data for 2014-15 to 2016-17 in sub-state data cubes. Data for 2011-12 to 2016-17 at the state, territory and national levels are weighted to account for agency non-response and invalid statistical linkage keys (SLK), and have been rounded to the nearest integer. Due to improvements in agency response and rates of SLK validity, data from 2017–18 are no longer weighted. The removal of weighting does not constitute a break in time series, and these data are directly comparable with weighted counts for earlier years. As the weighting method is not suitable for sub-state units, the data in the sub-state cubes are not weighted.\n\n\nClients are considered to be homeless if they are living in any of the following circumstances: No shelter or improvised dwelling, Short-term temporary accommodation, House, townhouse or flat (couch surfing or with no tenure).\n\n\nClients are considered to be at risk of homelessness if they are living in any of the following circumstances: Public or community housing (renter or rent free), Private or other housing (renter, rent-free or owner), Institutional settings.\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data and has set suppressed values (\".\") as Null.",

    "description": "A series of geophysical traverses by the Atlantis II across the Argo Abyssal Plain, together with coring at a number of selected localities has provided new information on sedimentary and tectonic processes in this region of the northeast Indian Ocean. Isopach maps prepared from the seismic profiles show that sediment thicknesses crudely parallel the bathymetry. The presence of some diapirs in the Argo Abyssal Plain was indicated. It was not possible to say from the present program whether the probable diapirs are salt or mud-cored. A diverse group of cores were obtained from a variety of sites including siliceous clays from below the CCD, calcareous oozes from above the CCD, calcareous clays (showing evidence of abundant sulphate reduction) from a fore-arc basin site, and manganese nodules from an abyssal site. In addition, hyaloclastites from the Joey Rise area (north of the Exmouth Plateau), suggest that the Joey Rise, and possibly also the Roo Rise, are underlain by basaltic material. A sample of basalt was also recovered from the outer part of the Exmouth Plateau.\n\nYou can also purchase hard copies of Geoscience Australia data and other products at http://www.ga.gov.au/products-services/how-to-order-products/sales-centre.html",

The accuracy of these points should fall within ± 20m.\nLayers were supplied as ESRI shapefiles in CIG85 projection.

The data shows the number of business establishments per city (CLUE) block, classified by their ANZSIC1 industry and small area allocation. The data is aggregated to the 2016 Blocks for CLUE Boundaries and covers the year period of 2002.\nA business establishment is defined as a \n\n\nCommercial occupant in a building\n\n\nSeparate land use\n\n\nAny permanent presence of economic activity in accordance with standard Industry classification (ANZSIC).\n\n\nHence, if one organisation has its presence in several buildings in the CLUE area, each time it will be counted as a separate establishment. Consequently, the count of establishments presented in CLUE represents the number of locations, rather than 'enterprises'.\nFor more information please visit the City of Melbourne CLUE Portal and ABS ANZSIC Page.\nPlease note: \n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the data acquired through the City of Melbourne Open Data Portal.\n\n\nThe individual yearly tables have been extracted from the archived 2002-2017 tables.\n\n\nThe data in this table is a snapshot and not live.\n\n",

The statewide severity map has standardised classes to allow comparison of different fires across the landscape. The FESM severity classes include: unburnt, extent only (grass fires), low severity (burnt understory, unburnt canopy), moderate severity (partial canopy scorch), high severity (complete canopy scorch, partial canopy consumption), extreme (full canopy consumption).\n\nThis dataset represents the 2023/24 fire year including all wildfires and hazard reductions &gt;10ha with a fire start date between 1 July 2023 and 30 June 2024.",

The Indigenous use and rights information was sourced from multiple Indigenous land ownership, land management and land rights datasets from relevant Australian, state and territory government agencies. The forest cover (National Forest Inventory forest types) information was derived from the Forests of Australia (2013) dataset. The dataset provides both Indigenous use and rights and forest type information for forested lands and Indigenous use and rights information only for non-forested lands. \r\n\r\nThe dataset was compiled by the Australian Bureau of Agricultural Resource Economics and Sciences (ABARES) for use in the National Indigenous Forestry Strategy (NIFS) and Australia's State of the Forests Report 2013 (SOFR). The dataset, compiled for use at the national scale, identifies four nationally consistent Indigenous estate categories which indicate the degree of management control that Indigenous people have over both forested and non-forested land. The categories are:\r\n1.\tIndigenous owned and managed;\r\n2.\tIndigenous managed;\r\n3.\tIndigenous co-managed; and\r\n4.\tOther Special rights.\r\nThese categories align with the reporting requirements of the SOFR and meet the requirements of the data suppliers.\r\n",

    "description": "Supporting the community to strengthen social cohesion and belonging by collecting, protecting and celebrating NSW's stories, artefacts, content, arts, culture and heritage experiences. \nNSW is home to the oldest and most distinctive cultural institutions in the country. Visitation rates to our cultural institutions have surged past our pre-COVID records, with the Australian Museum recording the highest visitation rate in its almost 200-year history and more than 2 million visitors to the new expanded Art Gallery of NSW campus Naala Badu and Naala Nura. Expanding access to online engagement has been hugely significant too, with more than 21 million views globally of Sydney Opera House videos (in addition to its 10 million visitors to the site each year)  and 4.6 million sessions on the State Library's website. Investment in the Powerhouse (MAAS) sites will support sharing its exhibitions with more people across NSW. The Museums of History NSW experienced growing visitation across their sites, which bring history to life through diverse voices and viewpoints.  \nNote on the data: \nThe data provided here reflects a reproduction of onsite visitation figures that have been published in the respective cultural institutions annual report. The data does not reflect offsite engagement activities (e.g. offsite public programs and touring activity). It also relates only to the primary site of visitation, for example, The State Library of NSW helps administer all public libraries in NSW (under the Library Act 1939) and visitation to these local libraries is not included in the above State Library visitation figure. In 2023-24, there were over 26 million visits to NSW public libraries. In that year, $40.89m of the State Library’s budget was provided for public library funding to local councils.\nEach individual annual report includes supporting information such as closures or attendance limitations due to revitalisation, refurbishment, COVID measures, and COVID recovery measures such as free admission. \nEach cultural institution has its own methodology and categorisation of onsite visitation, and attendance rates are not directly comparable.\nData gaps: \nFor 2018-19 only, the State Library published a combined online and onsite visitation figure. The data for the State Library for this year included above is on-site visitation only, which was sources directly from the State Library (i.e. not their annual report).\nThe Museums of History NSW was created in 2022, incorporating stewardship responsibilities for the State Archives and for significant museums, houses and collections. Previous data from the annual reports of the State Archives and Records Authority of NSW (SARA) (reading room and onsite programming) and Sydney Living Museums (total onsite visitation including grounds) from 2018-19 to 2021-22 have been included for comparison before 2022.

    "description": "The Department of Water and Environmental Regulation produces floodplain mapping of rivers and major watercourses and provides floodplain development advice to ensure that proposed floodplain development has adequate flood protection and does not impact on the existing flood regime of the area.\n\nThis advice is related to major river flooding only. Other issues, such as stormwater drainage and envirionmental and ecological considerations are not addressed. \n\nThis dataset contains 8 extent types as follows:\n\n1 in 10 (10%) AEP flood level contour\n1 in 20 (5%) AEP flood level contour\n1 in 25 (4%) AEP flood level contour\n1 in 50 (2%) AEP flood level contour\n1 in 100 (1%) AEP flood level contour\nDesignated flood event level contour\n1 in 200 (0.5%) AEP flood level contour\n1 in 500 (0.2%) AEP flood level contour\n\nThis dataset describes how flood levels vary across the floodplain for various sized flood events. Flood levels are referenced to the Australian Height Datum (AHD) \n\nNote: To see the full scope of the floodplain mapping, 12 dataset layers are required to be loaded in the following order:\n\nFLOODPLAIN DATASET LAYERS:    \nFPM Flood Level Points (m AHD)\nFPM Flood Level Contours (m AHD)\nFPM 1 in 100 (1%) AEP Floodway and Flood Fringe Line\nFPM Extent of Flooding\nFPM Levee Banks\nFPM Location of Cross Sections\nFPM 1 in 100 (1%) AEP Floodplain Development Control Area\nFPM Map Index\nFPM Bridges\nFPM Special Development Condition Area\nFPM 1 in 100 (1%) AEP Floodway and Flood Fringe Area\nFPM Floodplain Area\n\nThe dataset covers the following areas:\n<ul>\n<li>\n\nAvon River - Brookton Townsite.\n</li>\n<li>\n\nCollie River - Collie Townsite. \n</li>\n<li>\n\nFitzroy River – Fitzroy Crossing Townsite.\n</li>\n<li>\n\nGascoyne River - Carnarvon Townsite and the Lower Gascoyne (contains both pre and post-stage 2 Carnarvon flood mitigation works mapping: refer to COMMENTS field)\n</li>\n<li>\n\nGreenough River – Indian Ocean to Walkaway.\n</li>\n<li>\n\nKatanning Townsite.\n</li>\n<li>\n\nLower Collie River, Brunswick River and Wellesley River - Greater Bunbury.\n</li>\n<li>\n\nPreston River - Donnybrook Townsite.\n</li>\n<li>\n\nSerpentine River, Peel, Birrega &amp; Oaklands Drains, Murray River and the Peel Inlet / Harvey Estuary - Peel Inlet to the confluence of the Dandalup-South Dandalup-North Dandalup Rivers and south to the Darling Scarp via Pinjarra (Murray River), Peel Inlet to Black Lake (Nambellup Brook) and Geogrup Lake to South Western Highway (Serpentine River), north to Wellard (Peel Main Drain) and to Wungong Brook (Birrega Drain).\n</li>\n<li>\n\nSwan River, Canning River and Tributaries: Perth - Fremantle to Walyunga National Park (Swan River) and Canning Bridge to Brookton Highway (Canning River). Tributaries include Bennett Brook, Blackadder Creek, Ellen Brook, Helena River, Henley Brook, Jane Brook, St Leonards Creek, Susannah Brook (Swan River) and Southern River/ Wungong Brook (Canning River).\n</li>\n</ul>\n\nFor further information on flooding and floodplain management in Western Australia please refer to our Water Facts publications: Flooding in Western Australia (Water facts 13) and Floodplain Management (Water facts 14).\n\nThis information is available at the following addresses: \nhttps://www.wa.gov.au/system/files/2022-11/Water-facts-14-Floodplain-management.pdf https://www.wa.gov.au/system/files/2022-11/Water-facts-14-Floodplain-management.pdf\n\nGlossary:\n<ul>\n<li>\n\nAnnual exceedance probability (AEP) - the likelihood of occurrence of a flood of a given size or larger in any one year; usually expressed as a percentage.\n</li>\n<li>\n\n1 in 100 AEP flood - this means that there is a 1 in 100 (or 1%) chance of a flow of this size or larger occurring in any one year. This flood has a 50% chance of being experienced at least once in a person's life time. The 1 in 100 AEP flood has been generally adopted in Australia and overseas as the basis for floodplain management planning.\n</li>\n<li>\n\nFloodplain - the portion of a river valley next to the river channel which is covered with water when the river overflows its banks during major river flows. The term also applies to land adjacent to estuaries which is subject to flooding.\n</li>\n<li>\n\nAustralian Height Datum (AHD) - is a geodetic datum for altitude measurement in Australia. It was adopted in 1971 by the National Mapping Council as the datum to which all vertical control for mapping is to be referred. The datum is based on the mean sea level (1966-1968) being assigned the value 0.000m on the Australian Height Datum (AHD) at 30 tide gauges around the coast of the Australian continent.\n</li>\n</ul>",

    "description": "This dataset presents aggregated values of the Total Income as a category of the estimates of Personal Income for Small Areas ABS release. The data spans over the financial years of 2010-11 to 2014-15 and is aggregated to the 2016 Local Government Area (LGA) boundaries.\nThis release presents regional data on the number of income earners, amounts they receive, and the distribution of income for the 2010-11 to 2014-15 financial years. An improved geocoding process has been introduced for this release. As such, previously released estimates for the 2010-11 and 2012-13 financial year have been superseded. The following personal income categories are provided in this census release:\n\n\nEmployee Income\n\n\nOwn Unincorporated Business Income\n\n\nInvestment Income\n\n\nSuperannuation Income\n\n\nOther Income (Income not allocatable to any other categories)\n\n\nTotal Income (Sum of previous categories)\nThese statistics provide insights into the nature of regional economies and the economic well-being of the people who live there. The data has been sourced from the Australian Taxation Office (ATO) and is presented with the updated 2016 editions of the Australian Statistical Geography Standards (ASGS):  Statistical Area Level 2 (SA2); Statistical Area Level 3 (SA3); Statistical Area Level 4 (SA4); Greater Capital City Statistical Area (GCCSA) and Local Government Area (LGA).\n\n\nFor more information on the release please visit the Australian Bureau of Statistics.\nPlease note:\n\n\nWhen interpreting these results, it should be noted that some low income earners, for example those receiving Government pensions and allowances, or those who earned below the tax free threshold, may not be present in the data, as they may not be required to lodge personal tax forms. Other individuals may not lodge a tax return even if required, therefore care should be taken in interpreting the data as well as comparing the data in this publication with other income data produced by the ABS.\n\n\nTo minimise the risk of identifying individuals in aggregate statistics, a confidentialisation process called perturbation has been applied to the data. Perturbation involves small random adjustment of the statistics and is considered the most satisfactory technique for avoiding the release of identifiable statistics while maximising the range of information that can be released.\n\n\nWhere data is not available or not for publication, the record has been set to a null value.\n\n",

For more information view the About prescribed burns page, or view the Schedule of Prescribed Burns.\nThe SBMP requires regional fire management plans (RFMPs) to provide a link between the strategy of this plan and the more detailed bushfire operational plans (BOPs). RFMPs will be updated to cover the entire ACT to reflect boundaries based on bushfire risk and geography. RFMPs detail the five-year program (2014–19) of work for fuel reduction, access and infrastructure in the ACT. RFMPs for 2019–24 will be prepared during the life of the SBMP.\nThe ACT Emergency Services Commissioner (the Commissioner) is responsible for approval of RFMPs. They will be reviewed as required to reflect significant changes. These may include unplanned bushfires, which may provide strategic advantages or changes to the location or extent of assets – for example, the development of new estates.\nIMPORTANT NOTICE\n\nThe ACT Government is providing this bushfire management map for information purposes only. This data is derived from the best available vegetation.

    "description": "This dataset is a component of the 'Jervis Bay Baseline Studies' project conducted by the Department of Defence, CSIRO and the Australian Defence Force Academy. \n\nApproximately once per month between 1988-1991, temperature-salinity surveys were conducted on various transects within Jervis Bay and out across the continental shelf. This record describes CTD data from a N-S transect, running from Red Point in the north, to Creswell in the south. Measurements were made using a Neil Brown 'Smart' CTD. On the day of sampling 9 stations were chosen on the transect, with the CTD recorder measuring salinity, temperature and sigma-T through the water column.\n\nTwo resources are provided: 1) An excel document providing details of sampling locations and the raw CTD data collected, and 2) A map showing the location of each sampling station.\n\nThis is one of nine child records that relate to the parent, 13391430-2ae8-11dd-a735-00188b4c0af8. A pdf outlining the structure and hierarchy of all metadata records relating to this project is available to download through this record. Also available is a pdf of a published working paper documenting this experiment and the results.",

Count of responses and persons in the following categories with corresponding ancestry: both parents born overseas, father born overseas, mother born overseas, both parents born in Australia, parents birthplace not stated. The list of ancestries consists of the most common 30 Ancestry responses reported in the 2011 Census. This is a multi-response dataset and therefore the total responses count will not equal the total persons count. If two responses from one person are categorised in the 'Other' category only one response is counted. If either or both parents birthplace is not stated then a single response is tallied in the 'not stated' category. The data is by SA1 2016 boundaries. Periodicity: 5-Yearly. \nNote: There are small random adjustments made to all cell values to protect the confidentiality of data. These adjustments may cause the sum of rows or columns to differ by small amounts from table totals.\nFor more information visit the data source: http://www.abs.gov.au/census. ",

    "description": "This dataset presents the footprint of the number of installations of small generation unit (SGU) solar panel systems and their rated output in kilowatts (kW). The data spans the months of 2006 and includes the total for the year. The data is aggregated to Postal Areas (POAs) from the 2016 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nEvery month the Clean Energy Regulator (CER) publishes small-scale renewable energy installation data files. These data files provide a list of SGU (small-scale solar panel, wind and hydro systems) and kW capacity by installed postcode, and solar water heaters (SWH) and air source heat pumps by installed postcode. The data represents all systems that have had certificates validly created against them. The data includes new installations, upgrades to existing systems and stand-alone (off-grid) systems. This data is not publicly available via the Renewable Energy Certificate (REC) Registry and does not include systems that are pending registration or have been failed by the CER.\nFor further information about this dataset, visit the data source:Clean Energy Regulator - Postcode Data for Small-scale Installations.\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data by joining the data with the 2016 ASGS POAs\n\n\nThe data is current as at 30-09-2018.\n\n\nRenewable Energy Target (RET) legislation allows a 12 month creation period for registered persons to create their certificates.\n\n\nSmall-scale technology certificates are calculated based on the life of the system. This differs for solar hot water heaters and small generation units (solar panels, wind and hydro). Further information can be found at theRenewable Energy Target FAQ.\n\n\nCapacity data has been revised to account for past data entry errors which caused significant inconsistencies. These systems were installed between 2001 and 2003. As a result of this revision, the cumulative installed capacity from 2004 onwards has reduced by 5.517MW.\n\n",

The location and alignment of these zones reflect the risk of bushfires starting and spreading, and impacting on life, property and other assets. Fire Management Zones form an integral part of the ACT Government’s approach to mitigating bushfire risk.\n\nThe zones established include <strong>Inner and Outer Asset Protection Zones, Strategic Firefighting Advantage Zones, Landscape Fire Management Zones, Agricultural Fire Management Zones and Aboriginal Fire Management Zones</strong>.\n\nFire Management Zones are the link between the SBMP and the on-ground implementation of fuel management practices and are defined by the ACT Bushfire Management Standards.&nbsp;\n\nFire Management Zones are reviewed annually to ensure they are kept up to date with the growing urban edge of the ACT. The Commissioner is responsible for approval of these maps.&nbsp;\n\nPlease refer to this <a href=\"https://esa.act.gov.au/about-esa/publications/strategic-bushfire-management-plan\">page</a> for more details on ACT Bushfire Management Standards.&nbsp;",

This represents the highest astronomical tide at Launceston with average atmospheric pressure and neutral wind conditions.

The HER dataset identifies the location of: Heritage items (including archaeological sites) and Heritage conservation areas (including places of Aboriginal heritage significance).\n The original GIS data was captured by local councils, DP&amp;I and contractors and provided in accordance with the DP&amp;I's Standard Requirements for GIS LEP data and Standard Technical Requirements for LEP maps. Before the LEP is notified on the NSW Legislation website, the mapping is checked by DP&amp;I and the Parliamentary Council's Office to ensure that it is consistent with these standards. After the LEP is notified, the GIS data is quality controlled using an ISO 9001-Quality-Certified, Quality Management System and incorporated into the Statewide dataset. The Land Application data relates directly to and adopts the accuracy of its reference dataset, Land and Property Information DCDB. The GIS data may be subject to change as a part of quality control, or if the LEP is amended. Please confirm dates of respective features before use as this dataset has a large temporal extent.",

This dataset contains reports, data and metadata used in the flood study, and results data for the existing floodplain condition scenarios.  \n\nCouncil is committed to ensuring we have the latest flood modelling data to help manage flood risk in Brisbane. Flood studies provide Council with technical data to inform policy and for managing flooding within the Brisbane River and local creek and overland flow catchments.  \n\nThe Citywide Creek and Overland Flow Path Mapping Flood Study comprises a series of 27 individual sub-models which cover the entire Brisbane City Council area. Results data for flood height, depth and hazard (depth x velocity) are available for each individual sub-model for the 2, 5, 10, 20, 50, 100, 500 and 2000 year Average Recurrence Interval (ARI) storm events.   \n\nFor specific details on how the study was conducted, the areas it covers, and before using the data please read the flood study report. The flood study report, metadata used in the flood study and a detailed map that shows the 27 individual sub-models has also been made available in open data and is called <a href=\"https://data.brisbane.qld.gov.au/explore/dataset/flood-study-citywide-overland-flow-reference\">Flood Study — Citywide Overland Flow — reference</a>.  \n\nThe data on the table tab is the metadata relating to the data used for flood modelling in the Brisbane City Council Citywide Creek and Overland Flow Path Mapping Flood Study.   \n\nMore information on flood studies and how this information is used can be found on the <a href=\"https://www.brisbane.qld.gov.au/community-safety/community-safety/disasters-emergencies/be-prepared/flooding-brisbane/flood-strategy/flood-studies\">Brisbane City Council Website</a>.\nThe image below shows the 27 individual sub-models of the flood study and can be used to identify the sub-model for your location of interest.\n\n  ",

Fuel\nmanagement can reduce fire behaviour and severity, improve firefighter safety,\nincrease the probability of suppression and reduce the impacts of bushfires on\nnatural and built assets. The three means for managing bushfire fuels are\nreduction, removal and conversion to a less flammable type, and are achieved by\nundertaking the slashing, grazing, physical removal, and/or prescribed burns\n\n\nThese activities are described in a yearly program of work\nreferred to as the <a href=\"https://www.act.gov.au/open/bushfire-management-plans\">Bushfire Operations Plan</a> (BOP), which sets out activities to meet the\nrequirements of the <a href=\"https://esa.act.gov.au/community-information/publications/sbmp/\">Strategic\nBushfire Management Plan for the ACT</a> (SBMP). The <a href=\"https://www.actmapi.act.gov.au/\">Bushfire Map</a> shows the Environment, Planning &amp;\nSustainable Development Directorate (EPSDD) Bushfire Operations Plan (BOP) for\nthe current financial year.\n\n\nThe EPSDD BOP is derived from the 5-year Regional Fire\nManagement Plans, which can also be viewed on this site. The EPSDD BOP details\nthe specific timing, type and location of fuel-reduction, access and\ninfrastructure activities proposed to be undertaken in the ACT in the current\nfinancial; year, in accordance with the Strategic Bushfire Management Plan\n(SBMP).",

    "description": "This resource contains geochemistry data for the Oceanic Shoals Commonwealth Marine Reserve (CMR) in the Timor Sea collected by Geoscience Australia during September and October 2012 on RV Solander (survey GA0339/SOL5650). This dataset comprises carbonate concentrations and specific surface area measurments on the upper 2 cm of seabed sediments. The Oceanic Shoals Commonwealth Marine Reserve survey was undertaken as an activity within the Australian Government's National Environmental Research Program Marine Biodiversity Hub and was the key component of Research Theme 4 - Regional Biodiversity Discovery to Support Marine Bioregional Plans. Hub partners involved in the survey included the Australian Institute of Marine Science, Geoscience Australia, the University of Western Australia, Museum Victoria and the Museum and Art Gallery of the Northern Territory. Data acquired during the survey included: multibeam sonar bathymetry and acoustic backscatter; sub-bottom acoustic profiles; physical samples of seabed sediments, infauna and epibenthic biota; towed underwater video and still camera observations of seabed habitats; baited video observations of demersal and pelagic fish, and; oceanographic measurements of the water column from CTD (conductivity, temperature, depth) casts and from deployment of sea surface drifters. Further information on the survey is available in the post-survey report published as Geoscience Australia Record 2013/38: Nichol, S.L., Howard, F.J.F., Kool, J., Stowar, M., Bouchet, P., Radke, L.,Siwabessy, J., Przeslawski, R., Picard, K., Alvarez de Glasby, B., Colquhoun, J., Letessier, T. & Heyward, A. 2013.

    "description": "Updated data for the Australian Government’s Income Management (IM) program will be available on the third Thursday of every month. The data summary will include: \r\n\r\nTable 1. Number of IM participants by location and measure \r\n\r\n1.1 Northern Territory\r\n \r\n1.2 Western Australia\r\n \r\n1.3 Queensland \r\n\r\n1.4 South Australia\r\n \r\n1.5 Victoria \r\n\r\n1.6 New South Wales\r\n \r\n\r\nTable 2. Number of IM participants with an active BasicsCard by State/Territory \r\n\r\nTable 3. Number of IM exemptions by Indigenous Indicator \r\n\r\nThe data provided will be the last weekly data update for the previous month. \r\n\r\n__Legislation__ \r\n\r\nLegislation for IM is located [here](https://www.legislation.gov.au/C2004A00580/latest/text) in the _Social Security (Administration) Act 1999_.\r\n\r\nThe Guide to Social Policy Law for IM is located [here](https://guides.dss.gov.au/guide-social-security-law/11).\r\n \r\n\r\n__Information about IM__ \r\n\r\nMore information about Income Management is located [here](https://www.humanservices.gov.au/individuals/services/centrelink/income-management) on the Department of Human Services web site.\r\n\r\n\r\n__Locations__\r\n\r\nThe places that have IM, by State and Territory, is located [here](https://www.humanservices.gov.au/individuals/services/centrelink/income-management/where-payments-are-income-managed) on the Department of Human Services web site. \r\n\r\n\r\n__Data Confidentialisation Policy__ \r\n\r\nTable cells are suppressed where the count refers to less than five, but more than zero, people. The method is: \r\n\r\n* Cells with counts between one (1) and four (4) are presented as <5. \r\n* Cells with counts between one (1) and four (4) are presented as <5.\r\n* Cells with a count of zero (0) are not suppressed. \r\n* Where suppression has been applied and it is still possible to derive the cell value from other information in the table, the total/s or the next lowest aggregate cells are suppressed and presented with ‘n.p.’ (not provided). \r\n\r\n__Data Caveats__\r\n\r\n1. Any variance from data reported prior to 28 August 2015 is due to a change to conform to the Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS). \r\n2. Inconsistencies may be attributed to participants moving from the location where they were originally triggered onto the program. \r\n3. Participants with ‘Unknown’ locations did not have a recorded address at the time of data extraction. This often occurs because a participant is in the process of moving address. \r\n4. ‘Uncategorised CIM’ customers are instances where a customer was assessed for Income Management but was never switched ON and assigned a Category Code. \r\n5. ‘Greater Brisbane’ includes ‘Logan’. \r\n6. ‘Far North’ includes ‘Cape York’. \r\n7. For ‘Current Income Management Exemptions by Indigenous Indicator’, automatic exemptions for <25% of Max Payment is not included.",

The other two are the 1:500 000 State Cenozoic geology and the 1:500 000 State linear structures layer (DMIRS-015).\nCompilation is based on published 1:100 000 and 1:250 000 Geological Series maps of Western Australia, together with GSWA and GA (AGSO, BMR) regional geological maps at scales from 1:250 000 to 1:1 000 000. Information from these maps has been modified locally using geophysical datasets (magnetics, radiometrics and gravity), remote sensing imagery (ASTER and LANDSAT), seismic and magnetotelluric profiles, drilling, and unpublished geological mapping. The nomenclature and hierarchy for the lithostratigraphic units are based on the GSWA Explanatory Notes System (extracted April 2016). Data are held in GDA94 decimal degrees.\n\nThis dataset was formally known as 1:500 000 State interpreted bedrock geology (DMP-013)",

Landfills can cause contamination, but once a landfill is closed, operators are obliged to rehabilitate and manage their sites. Even when closed, careful management of sites is required. Many rehabilitated landfills are now safe parks and public spaces, enjoyed by the community.\nThe register draws information from various sources and all sites listed undergo verification before inclusion on the register.\nWhile this public register will make landfill information more available, it should not be used as the only source of information when making important decisions. EPA will continue to build on the register, adding information and improving the service.\nThis dataset mirrors the VLR data available on EPA's website, but may not be up to date due to data transfer processes. For the most up to date information on operating landfill please visit the EPA register of permission.",

    "description": "In this product the Burdekin is divided into 5,521 5km x 5km cells. The main feature in this layer is the 'GullyPres' field, which provides a semi-quantitative gully presence value to each cell, ranging from Very Low to Very High. The gully presence assessment is based on several methods including visual observation, output from previous modelling work, bioregion membership, and the output of a mean of prodictive model. The method of mapping is provided in the 'SubMethod' field. The 'Confidence' field provides the source used to assign the 'GullyPres' field value.

    "description": "This data was collected in July 2010 by the IMOS Ship of Opportunity Underway CO2 Measurement research group on RV Southern Surveyor (IMOS platform code: VLHJ) voyage SS052010.\n\nDeparted:  Fremantle Australia, July 6, 2010\nArrived:  \t Fremantle, Australia, July 27, 2010\n\nCO2 System Overview:\nThe fugacity of carbon dioxide (fCO2) in surface seawater was measured using a General Oceanics Inc. automated system (Model 8050; Pierrot et al 2009). Seawater is sprayed into an equilibration chamber and CO2 in the headspace gas equilibrates with the seawater. The headspace gas is pumped through a thermoelectric condenser followed by a nafion drying tube before flowing through a Licor 7000 non-dispersive infrared gas analyser used to measure the CO2 mole fraction (XCO2) of the dried air. The gas flow is stopped temporarily for the CO2 measurements, which are made at atmospheric pressure. A set of four CO2 standards that cover the range of CO2 values expected in the ocean are analysed about every four hours to calibrate the gas analyser. The standard gas concentrations are on the WMO-X2007 mole fraction scale for CO2-in-air. Atmospheric XCO2 (dry) is measured after the standards by pumping clean outside air from an intake on the forward mast of the ship. \n\nSeawater intake and ancillary data:\nThe seawater intake is located at about 5.5m depth in the bow of the ship. Sea surface salinity is measured using a thermosalinograph (Seabird Electronics SBE21) located next to the CO2 system. A remote temperature sensor (Seabird Electronics SBE 38) located at the intake is used to measure sea surface temperature (SST). The travel time between the intake and CO2 system is typically about 4 minutes with warming usually less than 0.6ºC. The thermosalinograph water is from the same intake, but the supply lines separate after the intake. A comparison of thermosalinograph and equilibrator temperature records shows the temperature difference in the two lines is generally less than 0.1ºC. The thermosalinograph water line travels outside the ship and is typically warmer than the equilibrator. The travel time in water line to the thermosalinograph is 2.5 minutes faster than to the equilibrator. \n\nMeteorological data, salinity, SST, and ships position and time are taken from the ships logging system. These parameters and the data quality are maintained by the Australian Marine National Facility.",

Two time periods are provided in the south west agricultural zone only where the Land Monitor index can be more confidently applied, these time periods are 1990-current year and the last 10 years. The summaries are statistical measures of mean, linear trend over time, quadratic trend over time, standard deviation about mean, residual standard deviation after fitting linear trend and residual standard deviation after fitting linear and quadratic trends. The statistical summaries can be displayed separately or together to summarise trends and stability of vegetation over time as measured by the Land Monitor vegetation index, and in particular to highlight areas with different patterns of change.\n\nClick <a href=\"https://data.wa.gov.au/land-monitor\">here</a> for more information.",

    "description": "Foliage Projective Cover (FPC) is the percentage of ground area occupied by the vertical projection of foliage. The Remote Sensing Centre FPC mapping is based on an automated decision tree classification technique applied to dry season (May to October) Landsat-5 TM and Landsat-7 ETM  imagery for the period 1988-2012. The wooded extent product has a nominal accuracy of 85%. The field data used to calibrate the imagery/FPC relationship was mostly collected over the period 1996-1999. Corrections have been applied to remove errors due to topographic effects, cloud, cloud shadow, water, cropping, and regrowth following clearing. Some errors may remain. The product was generated from WRS-2 path/row scenes obtained from the United States Geological Survey (USGS). While some land cover change may be detected in the FPC processing, this product is not designed to generate clearing or regrowth following clearing layers, and should not be used to assess clearing or be compared with previous years for change monitoring without consideration of the error. The Statewide Landcover and Trees Study (SLATS) produces accurate clearing layers for this purpose.",

    "description": "A Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) image taken of East Gippsland in February 1995 was used to manually classify probable coupe boundaries resulting from logging utilisation on State Forest land.  The classification was undertaken using a visual interpretation method from digitally enhanced Landsat TM data and cross checked with 1:100 000 Landsat TM photographic data.  Probable coupe boundaries were captured digitally using ERDAS Imagine image processing software.  Following identification, probable coupe boundaries were exported as a vector coverage then imported into ARC/INFO where they were intersected with State Forest block and compartment boundaries.  The resulting coverage, containing forest block, compartment and probable coupe boundaries was printed at a scale of 1:100 000 to allow overlay with the Landsat TM photographic prints.\nThe subsequent classification was validated and attributed using regional harvest and wood utilisation plans provided by District Forestry Officers at the Department of Natural Resources and Environment (DNRE) in September 1996.  This layer was used to confirm and provide accurate spatial representation of regional DNRE logging records from 1990 to February 1995.\n\nThe disturance data consists of existing disturbance records for East Gippsland, which have been compiled into one temporary contiguous database.  The 1950 to 1992 (LOGHIST100) data was updated with 1992 to 1994 coupe95 data, and this dataset updated with 1994 to present wood utilisation plans (WUPS) data.  The more recent data was cut into older data.  Component data sets are loghist100, coupe95, and WUPS.\n\nThese are archived datasets, singly owned by Victoria under the RFA Data Agreement of 28 March 2000.\n\nThe completion date for the East Gippsland RFA was 3 February 1997.\n\nThe specific names of these datasets are LOGHIST1, LOGHIST2, LOGHIST3 and LOGHIST123.Available to the Commonwealth Government for the purpose of development, implementation, reporting or review of the Victorian Regional Forest Agreements.\n\nAll derived information products will acknowledge the data owners and carry a statement of origin, currency and reliability of the data.\n\nUse for other purposes by the Commonwealth is subject to the written approval of VicDNRE.\n\nSupply to third parties must be via VicDNRE and is subject to a written data supply agreememt or licence arrangement.\nRestricted\nData must be used within the documented tolerances, completeness, accuracy, precision and quality specifications.",

    "description": "<strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY</strong> \n\nIntroduction \n\nDungog is located in the Upper Hunter Region of New South Wales, approximately 60 km north of Newcastle and 70 km inland from the coastline at Seal Rocks. The township of Dungog is situated at the confluence of the Williams River and Myall Creek. Three smaller catchments including the township, Common Creek and Melbee Estate catchments also provide a source of flood risk to Dungog. \n\nDungog Shire Council (Council) is responsible for flood risk management and local land use planning within their Local Government Area (LGA). Council has commissioned Royal HaskoningDHV (RHDHV) to produce the Dungog Floodplain Risk Management Study and Plan (FRMS&amp;P) on behalf of Council and the NSW Office of Environment and Heritage (OEH). \n\nThe present FRMS&amp;P included developing a Flood Study that defined flood risk in Dungog from all sources (i.e. Williams River, Myall Creek and local township catchments. The Flood Study was completed in February 2017. \n\nHistory of Flooding in Dungog \n\nThe extreme flooding that devastated Dungog on the 21st of April 2015 was caused by an East Coast Low that caused significant flooding and damage to a number of areas in the Hunter Region and Sydney and is often referred to as the April 2015 “super storm”. The storm produced catastrophic flooding in Dungog resulting in three fatalities, washing four houses away and flooded some 80 dwellings, many to ceiling level. The flood event is likely to have an approximate annual exceedance probability (AEP) of 0.1% or an approximate frequency of a 1 in 1000 year average recurrence interval (ARI). \n\nOther significant floods include: The “Pasha Bulker storm of 8th June 2007 which flooded a number of low lying properties (on Hooke Street and Dowling Street) was approximately a 1 in 20 year ARI magnitude event. Three older significant events (with a 5yr - 10yr ARI magnitude) occurred in February 1990, October 1985 and April 1946. The recent January 2016 event was smaller than a 5yr ARI event.",

The majority of specimens were siltstones and tuffaceous sandstones, few of which contained good faunal assemblages. It has, therefore, not been possible to say definitely whether some of them are Pliocene (\"h\" stage) or Upper Miocene (\"g\" stage) in age. More definite age could be determined from the assemblage larger foraminifera found in the few limestones. The places where the samples were taken are shown in the accompanying locality map.",

    "description": "Overview \r\n The December edition of Agricultural commodities contains ABARES' latest outlook for Australia's key agricultural commodities in 2015-16, and updates the outlook ABARES released in September 2015. \r\n\r\n In addition to commodity forecasts, this publication includes two boxes: \r\n• seasonal conditions in Australia \r\n• farm cash income of broadacre farms \r\n and one article: • key agricultural outcomes of the Trans-Pacific Partnership Agreement. \r\n\r\nFarmer/stakeholder implications \r\n The Agricultural commodities report provides high quality and timely information that supports higher farm gate returns through informed decision making by primary producers. \r\n\r\nKey Issues \r\n Commodity forecasts  \r\n• The gross value of farm production is forecast to increase by 8 per cent in 2015-16 to around $57.6 billion, following an estimated increase of 4 per cent to $53.5 billion in 2014-15. At this forecast level, the gross value of farm production in 2015-16 would be around 17 per cent higher than the average of $49.4 billion over the five years to 2014-15 in nominal terms. \r\n• The gross value of livestock production is forecast to increase by around 13 per cent in 2015-16 to $30.0 billion following an estimated increase of 16 per cent in 2014-15. The forecast increase in 2015-16 mainly reflects expected increases in the farmgate prices for beef cattle, lamb, sheep and wool. \r\n• The forecast increases in farmgate prices are expected to more than offset a forecast decline of 5 per cent in the volume index of livestock production in 2015-16. This mainly reflects an assumption of more favourable seasonal conditions in the latter half of 2015-16 leading to reduced slaughter as a result of herd and flock rebuilding. \r\n• The gross value of crop production is forecast to increase by 2 per cent in 2015-16 to $27.6 billion alongside an expected increase of 2 per cent in the volume index of crop production. This mainly reflects increases in horticultural production offsetting the falling world prices of grains and oilseeds. \r\n• Export earnings from farm commodities are forecast to be around $44.0 billion in 2015-16, following a rise of 6 per cent to an estimated $43.6 billion in 2014-15. At this level, export earnings from farm commodities in 2015-16 would be around 15 per cent higher than the average of $38.2 billion over the five years to 2014-15 in nominal terms. \r\n• Agricultural commodities for which export earnings are forecast to rise in 2015-16 include: wheat (up 3 per cent to $5.7 billion), wool (9 per cent to $3.5 billion), wine (3 per cent to $2.1 billion), lamb (1 per cent to $1.7 billion), sugar (8 per cent to $1.4 billion), live feeder/slaughter cattle (16 per cent to $1.3 billion) and chickpeas (56 per cent to $0.6 billion). \r\n• These forecast increases are expected to be largely offset by forecast falls in export earnings from beef and veal (down 3 per cent to $8.6 billion), dairy (6 per cent to $2.3 billion), coarse grains (14 per cent to $2.3 billion), canola (8 per cent to $1.2 billion), cotton (21 per cent to $1.2 billion) and mutton (2 per cent to $0.8 billion). \r\n• Export earnings from fisheries products are forecast to increase by 17 per cent to around $1.7 billion in 2015-16, after increasing by an estimated 10 per cent to $1.4 billion in 2014-15. \r\n• The index of unit export returns for Australian farm exports is forecast to rise by 7 per cent in 2015-16, following an estimated rise of 6 per cent in 2014-15. The forecast increase in 2015-16 mainly reflects the effect of the assumed lower value of the Australian dollar, especially against the US dollar. \r\n• In Australian dollar terms, export prices of beef and veal, wool, wine, lamb, live feeder/slaughter cattle, rock lobster, mutton and chickpeas are forecast to increase in 2015-16. In contrast, export prices of wheat, barley, sugar and dairy products are forecast to decline. \r\n\r\n Economic assumptions underlying this set of commodity forecasts  \r\n• World economic growth is assumed to be 3.1 per cent in 2015 and 3.4 per cent in 2016. \r\n• Economic growth in Australia is assumed to average 2.5 per cent in 2015-16, compared with 2.2 per cent in 2014-15. \r\n• The Australian dollar is assumed to average around US72 cents in 2015-16, 14 per cent lower than the average of US84 cents in 2014-15. \r\n",

    "description": "Health justice partnerships (HJPs) are early intervention programs. Recognising the complexity of disadvantage, they occupy the space where health and social justice issues overlap. Providing integrated, person-centred services, HJPs work with individuals to overcome structural barriers that negatively impact on a person’s quality of life and to advocate for systemic change.\nAlthough there isn’t a clear causality, the relationship between unmet legal need and adverse health outcomes is thought to be mutually reinforcing. On the one hand, chronic illness or disability can cause barriers to accessing legal assistance and can compound social disadvantage. On the other hand, unaddressed legal issues can cause stress and anxiety contributing to mental and physical ill health1.\nBy taking a holistic approach, HJPs remove the need to draw a distinction between legal and health issues. In its evaluation report, Redfern Legal Centre describe the interrelated nature of health and legal issues for one of their clients:\n“Aron was in the MERIT program. He told his counsellor that he was having difficulty in paying back his loan under a Financial Management Order. He told his counsellor that his drug use was increasing due to the stress and anxiety about the debt, which was also increasing due to default fees and other charges. He was referred to the solicitor who found that as Aron was under a Financial Management Order, legally he was unable to deal with his own finances. The loan should never have been given and as such was voided through our advocacy. He reported saying that his stress had decreased significantly, and therefore his drug use.”2\nBy working together through an HJP the health and legal services are able to improve the negative physical and psychosocial factors which jointly impact the health of the individual, and alleviate the strain on the healthcare and legal systems\n\n<strong>Note:</strong> This resource was originally published on opengov.nsw.gov.au.

    "description": "This dataset presents the footprint of the number of closed treatment episodes by source of referral. A treatment episode is the period of contact between a client and a treatment provider where there are defined start (commencement) and end (cessation) dates. It is considered closed where any of the following occurs: treatment is completed or has ceased; there has been no contact between the client and treatment provider for 3 months; or there is a change in the main treatment type, principal drug of concern or delivery setting.\nThe alcohol and other drug treatment services (AODTS) data is based on data reported to the AODTS National Minimum Dataset (NMDS). The data spans the financial years of 2013-2017 and is aggregated to 2015 Department of Health Primary Health Network (PHN) areas, based on the 2011 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nThe AODTS data accompanies the Alcohol and other drug treatment services in Australia 2016-17 Report.\nFor further information about this dataset, please visit: \n\n\nAustralian Institute of Health and Welfare - AODTS Data Tables.\n\n\nAlcohol and other drug treatment services NMDS 2016-17 Quality Statement.\n\n\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data using the Department of Health - PHN Areas.\n\n\nThe PHN of the closed treatment episode was assigned based on the reported postcode of the client using the Australian Bureau of Statistics' (ABS) Postal Area 2013 to Primary Health Network 2015 concordance file. Clients with an invalid postcode were assigned to the PHN group 'PHN Unallocated' and removed from the analysis.\n\n\nTreatment episodes are excluded from the AODTS NMDS if they: are not closed in the relevant financial year; are for clients who are receiving pharmacotherapy and not receiving any other form of treatment that falls within the scope of the collection; include only activities relating to needle and syringe exchange; or are for a client aged under 10 years.\n\n\nSource of referral is the source from which the client was transferred or referred to alcohol and other drug treatment service.\n\n",

    "description": "A gravity core (GC09) was collected from a depth of 166m within the Capricorn Channel, southern Great Barrier Reef (GBR). Analysis of other parameters revealed the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) sitting at a depth of ~60cm's into the core. For this reason two samples were collected for X-ray Diffraction (XRD) analysis, the first at a depth of 5cm (GC09-5) representing interglacial sediment, and the second from a depth of 60cm (GC09-60) representing glacial sediment. Both samples exhibited high Mg calcite and aragonite, compared with calcite, suggesting that the primary carbonate influx to the core is from the surrounding reef platform, rather than pelagic influences. There was also a 10% increase in non carbonate material during the glacial, and this was primarily made up of feldspars and quartz indicating a relative increase in terrestrial sediment during the LGM.",

    "description": "This dataset contains environmental readings from microclimate sensors located across the city. The data is updated every hour in fifteen minute increments and can be used to determine variations in microclimate changes throughout the day. Microclimate data includes:\n- Ambient air temperature\n- Relative humidity\n- Barometric pressure\n- Particulate matter 2.5\n- Particulate matter 10\n- Average wind speed\n\nThe Microclimate Sensor Readings helps us to understand temperature, relative humidity, pressure, particulate matter 2.5, particulate matter 10, and average wind speed at different locations and different times of day to better inform decision-making and plan for the future.\n\nAdditional values are included in this dataset to provide an easier way to correlate the data with the official EPA Victoria data. These can be identified with the value 'epa' included in the type column. EPA Victoria report air quality readings in 1 hour and 24 hour averages. This includes; ambient air temperature readings in 1 hour average, relative humidity readings in 1 hour average, particulate matter 2.5 readings in 1 hour and 24 hour averages, and particulate matter 10 readings in 1 hour and 24 hour averages.\n\nThe site_id column can be used to merge the data with the Sensor Locations dataset which contains the sensor location. Any changes to sensor locations are important to consider when analysing and interpreting historical microclimate data.\n\nNote this dataset may not contain a reading for every sensor for every 15 minutes as the sensor devices might not have a reading for each value. There may be situations where no readings are reported for all sensors or only some readings are reported at a particular site.\n\nFor the description of each sensor please see the sensor type document.\n\nRelated datasets: \n\nMicroclimate Sensors - Sensor Locations",

    "description": "The National Pollutant Inventory (NPI) is a public Internet database, which provides the community, industry and government with free information about substance emissions and transfers in waste in Australia. The NPI database currently shows emissions of 93 substances from over 4,300 industrial facilities (including more than 870 in Victoria) and from non-industry (or diffuse) sources, such as non-reporting facilities and everyday household activities, including motor vehicle emissions, wood heaters and lawn mowers. \r\n \r\nThe NPI program aims to track levels of substance emissions to air, land and water so communities have access to information about emissions and transfers of toxic substances, that may affect them locally. The NPI specifically aims to:\r\n•         maintain and improve air and water quality;\r\n•         minimise environmental impacts associated with hazardous waste; and\r\n•         improve the sustainable use of resources. \r\n \r\nIndustrial facilities (above certain limits/thresholds) estimate their emissions and transfers annually using a variety of techniques and report to EPA Victoria and other jurisdictions. The diffuse emissions to air and surface waters are estimated by relevant state and territory government departments and published less frequently than the industry reports.  \r\n\r\nNational Pollutant Inventory data is courtesy of the Australian Government and is available from www.npi.gov.au.",

    "description": "Operational map:\nThe operational map for Grey Box Grey Gum Wet Sclerophyll Forest (GBWS) was constructed to resolve long-standing issues surrounding its identification, location and extent within the NSW State Forest estate covered by the eastern Regional Forest Agreements. \nThe project’s Threatened Ecological Community (TEC) Reference Panel (the Panel) interpreted the determination for GBWS and agreed that GBWS TEC is defined from quantitative floristic analyses of systematic plot data. Based on a strong association with the determination assemblage list and documented occurrences referenced in the determination, we have interpreted GBWS to be equivalent to a community described in a recent classification study in the Northern Rivers (OEH, 2012); 1000-1665: (Grey Gum - Grey Box - Hoop Pine shrubby open forest on hinterland hills of the Richmond and Clarence catchments, South Eastern Queensland Bioregion and NSW North Coast Bioregion). \nWe conducted plot-based floristic comparison to assess whether GBWS or the equivalent Community 1000-1665 was present within 800 000 hectares of State Forest in the North Coast area. A map was developed based on plot assignments, aerial photography interpreted map polygons delineated from overstorey and understorey patterns, and results of predictive modelling. \nIn total, we identified approximately 2936 hectares of GBWS TEC in State forests north from Cherry Tree State Forest. Another state forest area has been identified as potentially supporting GBWS forest and is presented in a separate Indicative map.\nIndicative map:\nThe indicative map for Grey Box Grey Gum Wet Sclerophyll Forest (GBWS) was constructed to resolve long-standing issues surrounding its identification, location and extent within the NSW State Forest estate covered by the eastern Regional Forest Agreements. \nThe project’s Threatened Ecological Community (TEC) Reference Panel (the Panel) interpreted the determination for GBWS and agreed that GBWS TEC is defined from quantitative floristic analyses of systematic plot data.

A map was developed based on plot assignments, aerial photography interpreted map polygons delineated from overstorey and understorey patterns, and results of predictive modelling. \nIn total, we identified approximately 2936 hectares of GBWS TEC in State forests north from Cherry Tree State Forest. However, we also assigned three plots to GBWS, which are disjunct from and well outside the previously known distribution, to the south. Of the three disjunct plots, only one is in our state forest study area, in Nymboida state forest. We have no evidence that GBWS occurs south of Nymboida state forest. We identify Nymboida and Kangaroo River state forests in this Indicative Map, as plausible locations for the GBWS TEC. We recommend the GBWS TEC in these areas be diagnosed on a site-by-site basis using our field key until further survey and mapping can be completed in these forests.\nOperational TEC Mapping have been derived by API at a viewing scale between 1-4000 using ADS40 50 cm pixel imagery and 1 m derived LIDAR DEM grids for floodplain EECs.\nIndicative TEC Mapping have been generated from best available composite environmental data layers - standardised to 30 m pixels.",

    "description": "This dataset presents the summary preliminary estimates of the resident population by age and sex as at 30 June 2017, this includes population by sex, median age by sex and percentage of the population within a certain age range. The data is aggregated to the 2017 edition of the Local Government Areas (LGA).\nEstimated resident population (ERP) is the official estimate of the Australian population, which links people to a place of usual residence within Australia. Usual residence within Australia refers to that address at which the person has lived or intends to live for six months or more in a given reference year. For the 30 June reference date, this refers to the calendar year around it. Estimates of the resident population are based on Census counts by place of usual residence (excluding short-term overseas visitors in Australia), with an allowance for Census net undercount, to which are added the estimated number of Australian residents temporarily overseas at the time of the Census. A person is regarded as a usual resident if they have been (or expected to be) residing in Australia for a period of 12 months or more over a 16-month period.\nThis data is ABS data (catalogue number: 3235.0) available from the Australian Bureau of Statistics.\nFor more information please visit the Explanatory Notes.\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the data.\n\n\nRegions which contain unpublished data have been left blank in the dataset.\n\n\nWhere regions have zero population, the relating ratio and percentage columns have been left blank.\n\n",

    "description": "This dataset was collected as part of the City of Melbourne's Census of Land Use and Employment (CLUE). The data shows the number of business establishments per city (CLUE) block, classified by their ANZSIC1 industry and small area allocation. The data is aggregated to the 2016 Blocks for CLUE Boundaries and covers the year period of 2013.\nA business establishment is defined as a \n\n\nCommercial occupant in a building\n\n\nSeparate land use\n\n\nAny permanent presence of economic activity in accordance with standard Industry classification (ANZSIC).\n\n\nHence, if one organisation has its presence in several buildings in the CLUE area, each time it will be counted as a separate establishment. Consequently, the count of establishments presented in CLUE represents the number of locations, rather than 'enterprises'.\nFor more information please visit the City of Melbourne CLUE Portal and ABS ANZSIC Page.\nPlease note: \n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the data acquired through the City of Melbourne Open Data Portal.\n\n\nThe individual yearly tables have been extracted from the archived 2002-2017 tables.\n\n\nThe data in this table is a snapshot and not live.\n\n",
