The site provides additional features for viewing and interacting with the data and for downloading the data in various formats.</em></strong>  \n\nBrisbane City Council Citywide Creek and Overland Flow Path Mapping Flood Study Tingalpa Res East Sub-Model. This dataset contains reports, data and metadata used in the flood study, and results data for the existing floodplain condition scenarios.  \n\nCouncil is committed to ensuring we have the latest flood modelling data to help manage flood risk in Brisbane. Flood studies provide Council with technical data to inform policy and for managing flooding within the Brisbane River and local creek and overland flow catchments.  \n\nThe Citywide Creek and Overland Flow Path Mapping Flood Study comprises a series of 27 individual sub-models which cover the entire Brisbane City Council area. Results data for flood height, depth and hazard (depth x velocity) are available for each individual sub-model for the 2, 5, 10, 20, 50, 100, 500 and 2000 year Average Recurrence Interval (ARI) storm events.   \n\nFor specific details on how the study was conducted, the areas it covers, and before using the data please read the flood study report. The flood study report, metadata used in the flood study and a detailed map that shows the 27 individual sub-models has also been made available in open data and is called <a href=\"https://data.brisbane.qld.gov.au/explore/dataset/flood-study-citywide-overland-flow-reference\">Flood Study — Citywide Overland Flow — reference</a>.  \n\nThe data on the table tab is the metadata relating to the data used for flood modelling in the Brisbane City Council Citywide Creek and Overland Flow Path Mapping Flood Study.   \n\nMore information on flood studies and how this information is used can be found on the <a href=\"https://www.brisbane.qld.gov.au/community-safety/community-safety/disasters-emergencies/be-prepared/flooding-brisbane/flood-strategy/flood-studies\">Brisbane City Council Website</a>.\nThe image below shows the 27 individual sub-models of the flood study and can be used to identify the sub-model for your location of interest.\n\n  ",

Data are stored in .ENV and .DAT data files at CSIRO. There are 24 files totalling 154 MB of raw data in this dataset. A wharf tie was undertaken at Hobart location on 2025/3/7 (prior to IN2025_V01) using a Scintrex Autograv CG-5. Wharf tie data can be found in GravityTie_in2025v01_Hobart_250307.TXT, which is stored with the IN2025_V01 raw data.\nDuring this voyage, calibration lines were run for the Air-Sea II to re-establish calibration values after the system was repaired and reinstalled on the vessel (re-installed 30 Sep 2024). Data from the calibration lines were sent to Micro-G Lacoste for processing. New calibration values were applied within the ASII_HW.ini at the end of the voyage on 1st March 2025. \nAdditional information regarding this dataset is contained in the GSM data acquisition and processing report.",

    "title": "Assessment of River-Flat Eucalypt forest on Coastal floodplains TEC on NSW Crown Forest Estate",
    "description": "The operational map for River-flat Eucalypt Forest (RFEF) was constructed to resolve long-standing issues surrounding its identification, location and extent within the NSW State Forest estate covered by the coastal Integrated Forestry Operation Agreements. The map was constructed in two parts, with State Forests to the north of Sydney being mapped in a separate process to those to the south of Sydney. We did this to minimise the risk that relationships between regional vegetation communities and the TEC would be confounded or masked by geographical variation or other major ecological gradients, which might otherwise be a significant risk if we had treated the full latitudinal range of the TEC as a single study area. In total, we assessed 1,218,000 hectares of State Forest across coastal NSW. This consisted of 868,000 hectares of State Forest on the north coast and more than 350,000 hectares of State Forest on the south coast. \nIn both study areas, the project’s Threatened Ecological Community (TEC) Reference Panel (the Panel) preceded the assessment process by reviewing the determination for RFEF and agreeing upon a set of diagnostic parameters for its identification.  The Panel found that RFEF is primarily defined by floristic plot data and that it is mostly located on coastal floodplains and associated alluvial landforms.\nFollowing on from these conclusions, we started the mapping process by mapping the distribution of floodplains and alluvial soils and thus identifying possible areas of RFEF. For both the north and the south coast we used an existing map of coastal landforms and geology in combination with several fine-scale models of alluvial landform features to determine the likely extent of floodplains and alluvial soils within our study areas.\nWe used aerial photograph interpretation (API) to assess the floristic and structural attributes of the vegetation cover found on our modelled alluvial environments, and thus delineated polygons likely to contain RFEF.  We also used API to modify the boundaries of the modelled alluvial areas using a prescribed list of eucalypt, casuarina and melaleuca species in combination with the interpretation of landform elements relevant to alluvial and floodplain environments.\nWe then compiled floristic plot data for all State Forest areas within our modelled alluvial landforms and API polygons. For both the north and the south coast the floristic plot data was sourced from both existing flora surveys held in the OEH VIS database and from targeted flora surveys conducted specifically for this project. We compared these plots with those previously assigned to flora communities listed in the determination of RFEF. Both dissimilarity-based methods and multivariate regression methods were used for the comparison. The results of the comparison were then used to assess the likelihood that the plots in State forests belonged to one or more of the communities listed in the RFEF determination.\nFollowing this, we developed a predictive statistical model of the probability of occurrence of RFEF using plot data and a selection of environmental and remote-sensing variables. For the north coast, we used a Random Forest model, while for the south coast we used a Boosted Regression Tree model.\nTo create the operational map, we assigned every mapped API polygon to RFEF if appropriate based on the plot data, over-storey and understorey attributes, landform features and modelled probabilities underlying each API polygon. \nWe mapped 3819 hectares of RFEF on the south coast and 198 hectares of RFEF on the north coast.\nOperational TEC Mapping have been derived by API at a viewing scale between 1-4000 using ADS40 50 cm pixel imagery and 1 m derived LIDAR DEM grids for floodplain EECs.",

    "description": "In Western Australia, the Public Sector Commission's purpose is to bring leadership and expertise to the public sector to enhance integrity, effectiveness and efficiency. The Commission’s vision is of a high performing public sector serving the needs of the State now and into the future.\r\n\r\nIn accordance with section 22D of the _Public Sector Management Act 1994_, the Public Sector Commissioner reports annually to Parliament on the state of public sector administration and management, and on the extent of compliance with public sector standards and ethical codes. One of the primary information sources used for the State of the sector reports is the employee perception survey (EPS).\r\n\r\nThe EPS captures employee views about factors affecting their workplace, such as leadership, communication, work/life balance and performance development. This information helps to understand organisational culture across the public sector and is essential in identifying areas for further consideration and acknowledging good practice.\r\n\r\nThe EPS is typically conducted in each public sector body with more than 70 employees once every five years. To improve the representativeness of the sample, entities are selected across a range of sizes and portfolios. However, some care should be taken in interpreting the EPS results because the sample may not be entirely representative of the broader public sector.\r\n\r\nIn May and June of 2016, all employees in 11 public sector entities were asked to complete the survey. The average response rate to the survey was 53%, with 3883 valid responses received.\r\n\r\nThree files are available for download on data.gov.au:\r\n\r\n1)    Public Sector Commission EPS 2016.pdf – the survey instrument sent to relevant employees to access online\r\n\r\n2)    Public Sector Commission EPS 2016 data.xls – individual responses to the EPS, with a question key and response key. Please note that some variables have been removed or aggregated to protect the privacy and anonymity of respondents.\r\n\r\n3)    Public Sector Commission EPS 2016 data.sav – individual responses to the EPS, in .sav format to be used with SPSS. Please note that some variables have been removed or aggregated to protect the privacy and anonymity of respondents.\r\n\r\nFurther information about the EPS sample and summary results for 2016 are available in the State of the sectors statistical bulletin 2016.",

    "title": "Mobility Australia - Queensland Weekly Ferry Origin-Destination Flow (SA2) 2021",
    "description": "This dataset estimates human mobility through origin destination (OD) movement flow among the Statistical Area 2 (SA2) regions in Queensland (QLD), connected by public transport (PT) networks. The SA2 regions of Queensland connected by buses, trains, trams and ferries have been used to evaluate OD movement flows. The passenger OD movement data among different stations (or the station-based OD flow) are first estimated using a statistical estimation methodology. The stations-based OD flow data are then translated into region-based OD matrices using the state-of-art method. For more information please see the original metadata file here.\nHuman mobility data is a key ingredient in various areas and domains of research including epidemiology, policy and administration, criminology, transportation, logistics and supply chains, environmental management and, pollution and contamination. High quality human mobility data provided by telecommunication companies collected from call data records (CDRs) is available at prohibitive cost with restrictive licensing, keeping it out of reach for the majority of research community. On the other hand, there is an abundance of high-quality public data, reporting different aspects of mobility. Examples are the public transport patronage and information about the usage of the Australian road network. These datasets are collected by different organisations and government departments and are presented in various formats. For instance, data may be collected at different spatial (e.g. at state or postcode levels) and temporal scales and be presented in the form of passenger counts or aggregated movement flows. This dataset addresses the general lack of national scale comprehensive human mobility dataset in Australia by transforming available mobility data into a consistent format that is suitable for analysis in a broad range of research areas. Merging the various individual datasets into Australia's first comprehensive, national-scale human mobility data asset drastically improves the quality and coverage of existing datasets.\nThe Mobility Australia project received investment (https://doi.org/10.47486/DP702) from the Australian Research Data Commons (ARDC). The ARDC is funded by the National Collaborative Research Infrastructure Strategy (NCRIS).\nThe original data tables were structured in a matrix-like format. AURIN employed a methodology to merge diverse datasets into a comprehensive one, categorising based on transportation types (e.g., trains, buses, rails, ferries), years (e.g., 2019, 2020, 2021, etc.), and temporal scales (e.g., weekly, monthly, yearly). Subsequently, AURIN spatially enabled the original data by employing the 2021 edition of the Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS). The flow between origin and destination pairs is visually represented using line geometry.",

    "description": "    \n\nMean annual (00) and monthly (01a|12) transpiration (mm) from the plant canopy\nfor the period 1980-1999.Interpretation:Canopy transpiration is far more\nspatially variable than potential evaporation, reflecting the effects of water\nlimitation in most areas of the continent. Both the annual mean and seasonal\npattern broadly resemble the corresponding patterns for rainfall. Canopy\ntranspiration maps have more acontrasta (relative variation) than the total\nevaporation or rainfall maps because transpiration is a small component of\ntotal evaporation in areas of low plant cover (the remainder being soil\nevaporation).The partitioning between soil evaporation and canopy\ntranspiration in the model is determined by leaf area index.Notes: These are\nmodel-based estimates from the BiosEquil model. Results are given for the\naBASEa (pre-1788) and aAGRICa (present day) conditions.

    "description": "The <strong>Climate Vulnerability Assessment</strong> was designed to provide an overview of the impact of future climate change on all stages of production for the commodities and biosecurity risks assessed. The project used multicriteria analysis (MCA) models to produce assessments for the commodities and biosecurity risks in a consistent and comparable way, and a framework was developed to provide a rigorous, flexible and transparent process for assessing vulnerabilities and opportunities to climate change. Details of the approach and the climate data used in the assessments can be found in the <a href=\"https://www.dpi.nsw.gov.au/dpi/climate/climate-vulnerability-assessment/publications-and-reports\">Methodology Report</a> which also details model exclusions and assumptions.\n\nAssessments were undertaken on commodities grouped into 6 nodes: <em>Horticulture and Viticulture</em>, <em>Broadacre Cropping</em>, <em>Forestry</em>, <em>Extensive Livestock</em>, <em>Marine Fisheries</em>, as well as for a set of biosecurity risks related to these primary industry sectors. The <a href=\"https://www.dpi.nsw.gov.au/dpi/climate/climate-vulnerability-assessment/publications-and-reports\">Summary Report</a> gives details of the chosen commodities and biosecurity risks and summarises the high-level results.\n\nResults Reports for each commodity and biosecurity risk are being released. Visit the <a href=\"https://www.dpi.nsw.gov.au/dpi/climate/climate-vulnerability-assessment\">project's web pages</a> to access these reports and for further information.\n\nThis dataset contains maps of modelled climate suitability for the <strong>dryland maize</strong> model in the Broadacre Cropping node of the DPIRD Climate Vulnerability Assessment. Maps are provided (in GeoTIFF format) for each element of the model: the overall climate suitability, climate suitability maps for each phenophase and also for each phenophase/climate variable combination in the model. Data is provided for each of the eight global climate models (GCMs) used in the project, as well as the climate suitability derived from historical observations, along with the ensemble median for each map.",

Offering the largest amount of stars in any given direction in the sky, the GC is widely cited as a location believed to harbour advanced civilizations, and it is also the most energetic region in the Milky Way. We aim to conduct BL-GC Survey with Parkes radio telescope for around 350 hours. We will cover the frequency range from 700 MHz to 4 GHz, utilizing the newly installed ultra-wideband receiver. Our team has already leveraged both standard and bespoke tools to construct a flexible software stack to search data for signals of interest. We will look for signals from extraterrestrial intelligence (ETI) by searching for both simple narrow-band signals and complex modulated signals. Along with that, as an ancillary science, we will also search for accelerated pulsars — likely orbiting a supermassive black hole at the centre of the Milky Way Galaxy. Data products produced during this program will also be publically available to engage larger pulsar community",

    "description": "The scientific objectives for the survey were split across two voyages (SS07/2005 for leg 1 and SS10/2005 for leg 2). The first leg was to map and visually survey (video) the upper continental slope (and at selected sites transects from the outer shelf to the mid-slope) at regular intervals of 1deg latitude; the second leg was to targeted sample the surveyed locations to document the benthic biodiversity. Epibenthic megafauna was sampled in 123 stations using the epibenthic sled Sherman and a beamtrawl at roughly 1 degree intervals from Bald Island in southern WA to Barrow Island (northern WA), at 100 and 400m depth; additional depths (200m, 700m 1000m) were sampled at targeted 'transect sites'. Invertebrate specimens were photographed and lodged with Australian Museums for identification, focused on sponges, corals, echinoderms, crustaceans, molluscs and ascidians. To date (Sept. 2014) we are aware of 27 taxonomic revisions or descriptions have been published from this collection. Fishes were only collected by chance, they are lodged with the CSIRO Fish Collection. The data of the biological samples is described here.",

Further information about contributors to Administrative Boundaries is available [here](https://geoscape.com.au/legal/data-copyright-and-disclaimer/).\r\n\r\nThe full Administrative Boundaries dataset contains boundaries in seven themes: Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) boundaries, electoral boundaries, state and territory boundaries, local government areas, suburbs/localities, wards and town points.\r\n\r\nAs at November 2019, users have the option to download datasets with feature coordinates referencing the new Geocentric Datum of Australia 2020 (GDA2020) in addition to datasets on the GDA94 datum.\r\n\r\nFor GDA2020 datasets, the name of the zip folder and the root folder (once extracted) include a reference to GDA2020. For GDA94 datasets, the zip and root folder names do not contain the datum name (i.e. they remain the same as previous releases).\r\n\r\nFor example, the zip and root folder for Administrative Boundaries downloaded in GDA2020 for November 2019 looks like this:\r\n\r\n       •\tNOV19_AdminBounds_ESRIShapefileorDBFfile_GDA2020; or \r\n       •\tNOV19_AdminBounds_MapInfoTABFormat_GDA2020\r\n\r\nThe zip and root folder for Administrative Boundaries in GDA94 for November 2019 looks like this: \r\n\r\n       •\tNOV19_AdminBounds_ESRIShapefileorDBFfile; or \r\n       •\tNOV19_AdminBounds_MapInfoTABFormat\r\n\r\nIrrespective of the datum chosen, files within the respective folder use exactly the same naming structures.\r\n\r\nFurther information on Administrative Boundaries, including FAQs on the data, is available [here](https://geoscape.com.au/data/administrative-boundaries/) through Geoscape Australia’s network of [partners](https://geoscape.com.au/partners/).

Covering rural zoned, agricultural areas. These areas are applicable to Local Land Services Act 2016.\n</li>\n<li>\n\nNSW Horticulture mapping project – Fine scale mapping (1:5,000) mapping of horticulture production to the commodity level (where applicable), on the mid-north and north coast of NSW. This was in response to the outbreak of Panama disease, Tropical Race 4, found in a banana plantation in Northern Queensland. It is part of a collaborative mapping project to improve Biosecurity information between state jurisdictions and the commonwealth. It also covers plantation forestry for the project area.\n</li>\n<li>\n\nHunter 2013 mapping – 1:10,000 scale mapping covering most of the Hunter catchment based on 2013 SPOT5 imagery. It was part of a pilot land use update trial for intended use in Department of Planning Regional Growth Plans.

This component of the 2013 land use has a reliability scale of 1:25,000. The areas where the circa 2003 land use product used include; urban, industrial, commercial and environmental local government LEP (Local Environment Planning) zones. It also includes areas of metropolitan Sydney that are excluded from the LLS Act 2016.\n</li>\n</ul>\n\nLand use information has been captured in accordance with standards set by the Australian Collaborative Land Use Mapping Program (ACLUMP) and using the Australian Land Use and Management ALUM Classification. The ALUM classification is based upon the modified Baxter &amp; Russell classification and presented according to the specifications contained in http://www.agriculture.gov.au/abares/aclump/land-use/alum-classification.\n\nThe 2013 land use, that was mapped for the purposes of the Local Land Services Act, was commenced in July 2016 and completed by August 2017. It covers all rural zoned (agricultural) areas, and was based on most appropriate SPOT5 imagery to represent land use at June 2013. It includes values in the attribute fields of source, source date, source scale, reliability and land use mapping (currency) date.\n\nThe reliability scale of areas mapped form 2012 onward is 1:10,000. For areas where circa 2003 land use information has been used the reliability scale is 1:25,000. This is identified in the source scale attribute for each feature in the dataset.\n\nThe date of the data set is set as the land use occurring at the time the imagery (satellite or aerial) was acquired, which can range from 2003 to 2013. This dataset was updated in August 2017 to include values in the attribute fields of Source, Source Date, Source Scale, Reliability and LU Mapping (Currency) Date.\n\nA national catchment scale land use product is also available as a 50m raster - Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics and Sciences (ABARES) http://www.agriculture.gov.au/abares/aclump/land-use/data-download.",

    "description": "This dataset presents the footprint of the percentage of patients with costs, the total out-of-pocket cost per patient at the 25th, 50th, 75th and 90th percentile and various statistics for all patients. The data spans the financial year of 2016-2017 and is aggregated to Statistical Area Level 3 (SA3) geographic areas from the 2016 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nThe data is sourced from the Medicare Benefits Schedule (MBS) claims data, which are administered by the Australian Government Department of Health. The claims data are derived from administrative information on services that qualify for a Medicare benefit under the Health Insurance Act 1973 and for which a claim has been processed by the Department of Human Services. Data are reported for claims processed between 1 July 2016 and 30 June 2017. The data also contains the results from the ABS 2016-17 Patient Experience Survey, collected between 1 July 2016 and 30 June 2017. The Patient Experience Survey is conducted annually by the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) and collects information from a representative sample of the Australian population. The Patient Experience Survey is one of several components of the Multipurpose Household Survey, as a supplement to the monthly Labour Force Survey.\nThe Patients' spending on Medicare Services data accompanies the Patients' out-of-pocket spending on Medicare services 2016-17 Report.\nFor further information about this dataset, visit the data source:Australian Institute of Health and Welfare - Patients' out-of-pocket spending on Medicare services Data Tables.\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data.\n\n\nNon-hospital Medicare services are Medicare-subsidised medical services that were provided to patients who were not admitted into a hospital at the time of receiving the service. These include GP and practice nurse attendances, specialist attendances, obstetric attendances, pathology tests and collection items, diagnostic imaging, operations, assistance at operations, optometry, allied health attendances, radiotherapy and therapeutic nuclear medicine that were provided to patients not admitted into a hospital. This includes eligible telehealth services.\n\n\nTotal out-of-pocket cost per patient is the net cost to the patient for all non-hospital Medicare-subsidised health services they claim in a year, after deducting the Medicare benefit paid.\n\n\nThe data is based on the patient's Medicare enrolment postcode, not where they received the health care service. Most peoples' Medicare enrolment postcode will be their residential postcode.\n\n\nIf a service was flagged as bulk-billed, then the fee charged was set to equal the benefit paid (so there was no out-of-pocket cost for that service).\n\n\nPatients were excluded if the sum of eligible services in the year was less than one, or if their annual out-of-pocket expenditure on the eligible services was equal to or less than zero.\n\n\nCosts associated with bulk-billing incentives or other top-up items are included in the analysis.\n\n\nTotal out-of-pocket cost per patient is for patients with out-of-pocket costs greater than zero.\n\n\nAll patients include all patients with out-of-pocket costs equal to, or greater than, zero.\n\n\nNP - Not available for publication. The estimate is considered to be unreliable. Values assigned to NP in the original data have been set to null.\n\n",

    "description": "NSW Tenancy laws say how residential tenancy agreements can be ended. Tenancies are usually terminated by the tenant, landlord, the landlord's agent, or by a Tribunal order. Fair Trading conducted an end-of tenancy survey to collect data about how and why tenancies end. This survey was designed to help Fair Trading to better understand the renting experience to help inform future tenancy reforms.\nThe survey process:  Every principal tenant and landlord or nominated agent is asked to complete a survey when a bond claim is finalised through an online bonds system.  Survey invitations are sent by email and participation is voluntary. Individual responses are kept anonymous.\nFair Trading conducted a pilot end of tenancy survey which ran from 2 December 2019 to 30 March 2020 and from 27 April to 11 May 2020. \nTo mitigate re-identification risks, postcode information has been removed and response dates grouped into months.\nIt should be noted that the representativeness of the survey data is limited, including because:\n•   participation is voluntary\n•   the survey only includes respondents who used Rental Bonds Online to lodge and claim their rental bond, so the sample does not extend to all terminated tenancies\n•   no demographic information is collected\n•   some tenancies had duplicate responses\n•   domestic violence victims may also self-select out of completing such a survey, given their vulnerability and the difficult circumstances they may experience after ending a tenancy.",

    "description": "The <strong>Climate Vulnerability Assessment</strong> was designed to provide an overview of the impact of future climate change on all stages of production for the commodities and biosecurity risks assessed. The project used multicriteria analysis (MCA) models to produce assessments for the commodities and biosecurity risks in a consistent and comparable way, and a framework was developed to provide a rigorous, flexible and transparent process for assessing vulnerabilities and opportunities to climate change. Details of the approach and the climate data used in the assessments can be found in the <a href=\"https://www.dpi.nsw.gov.au/dpi/climate/climate-vulnerability-assessment/publications-and-reports\">Methodology Report</a> which also details model exclusions and assumptions.\n\nAssessments were undertaken on commodities grouped into 6 nodes: <em>Horticulture and Viticulture</em>, <em>Broadacre Cropping</em>, <em>Forestry</em>, <em>Extensive Livestock</em>, <em>Marine Fisheries</em>, as well as for a set of biosecurity risks related to these primary industry sectors. The <a href=\"https://www.dpi.nsw.gov.au/dpi/climate/climate-vulnerability-assessment/publications-and-reports\">Summary Report</a> gives details of the chosen commodities and biosecurity risks and summarises the high-level results.\n\nResults Reports for each commodity and biosecurity risk are being released. Visit the <a href=\"https://www.dpi.nsw.gov.au/dpi/climate/climate-vulnerability-assessment\">project's web pages</a> to access these reports and for further information.\n\nThis dataset contains maps of modelled climate suitability for the <strong>chickpea</strong> model in the Broadacre Cropping node of the DPIRD Climate Vulnerability Assessment. Maps are provided (in GeoTIFF format) for each element of the model: the overall climate suitability, climate suitability maps for each phenophase and also for each phenophase/climate variable combination in the model. Data is provided for each of the eight global climate models (GCMs) used in the project, as well as the climate suitability derived from historical observations, along with the ensemble median for each map.",

    "title": "Bushfire Operational Plans Access Management",
    "description": "Land and emergency management agencies in Australia and overseas recognise the importance of an access network to support bushfire management activities. Ground and aerial access provides a platform for fire reduction and readiness activities and provides opportunities to contain fires before they escalate into major fires that could otherwise incur significant costs and potentially significant losses to community, cultural and environmental values.\n\nFire access within the ACT consists of a network of roads, tracks and trails that support fire prevention, readiness and response activities. The identification and maintenance of fire access is an integral element of fire management across the ACT.\n\nAccess management is divided into four areas:\n<ol>\n<li>\n\nmaintenance\n</li>\n<li>\n\nupgrade\n</li>\n<li>\n\nconstruction\n</li>\n<li>\n\nvegetation removal.\n</li>\n</ol>\n\nACT PCS Fire Management Unit currently manage and maintain approximately 3,218 kilometres of roads and fire trails within the ACT. The classification of fire roads, tracks and trails is performance based to provide clear guidance to response agencies during incidents.\n\nGround access is defined in four classes:\n<ol>\n<li>\n\nFloat road – an access road or trail accessible to a low loader float carrying a large bulldozer or other heavy equipment.\n</li>\n<li>\n\nTanker road – a fire trail of strategic importance accessible to a heavy tanker and a tipper carrying a small bulldozer.\n</li>\n<li>\n\nLight unit trail – a fire trail accessible at minimum standard for a light unit.\n</li>\n<li>\n\nDormant fire trail – a trail that has been deliberately closed or not maintained and can be quickly re-opened with minimal works.\n</li>\n</ol>\n\nThe objective of ground access works are to upgrade and maintain road pavements within the parks and reserves of the ACT to the above four classes standard under the current Bushfire Operational Plan.  Many areas require ongoing general maintenance or upgrading to an appropriate standard. This is done principally to provide reliable access for operational requirements and for fire suppression activities in the event of a wildfire that may threaten the ACT.\n\nVegetation removal work is conducted by mechanical mulchers that reduce vegetation on roads and trails that impede access for operational and fire suppression requirements identified under the current Bushfire Operational Plan. The Parks and Conservation Service Fire Management Unit also commit a number of other contracted resources (graders, trucks, rollers, excavators and backhoes etc) to conduct daily scheduled maintenance as well as upgrade and construction services on a yearly basis within the ACT.\n\nThe Bushfire Operational Plans map shows the Territory and Municipal Services Directorate (TAMS) Bushfire Operations Plan (BOP) for the current financial year.\n\nThe TAMS BOP is derived from the 5 year Regional Fire Management Plans, which can also be viewed on this site. The TAMS BOP details the specific timing, type and location of fuel-reduction, access and infrastructure activities proposed to be undertaken in the ACT in the current financial; year, in accordance with Version 3 of the Strategic Bushfire Management Plan (SBMP).\n\nCreative Commons License Creative Common By Attribution 4.0 (Australian Capital Territory),\nPlease read Data Terms and Conditions statement before use of the data.",

    "description": "This dataset presents locations of regional surface hydrological features in Australia as points at a higher resolution than that of the national dataset. \nThe following features are included in this dataset:\n\n\nBore - A small diameter hole in the ground for the purpose of obtaining subterranean water by natural flow or mechanical pumping.\n\n\nDam - An open body of water collected and stored behind a constructed barrier consisting of earth, rock, concrete and/or masonry. Generally designed to capture run-off from the surrounding landscape or rainfall. The storage of water may occur on or below ground level.\n\n\nLock - An enclosure in a water body with gates at both ends to raise or lower the water level to enable vessels to pass from one level to another.\n\n\nGnamma Hole - Small holes of varying shape, diameter and depth, found in hard granite outcrops and in the decomposed granite of a breakaway, which can and usually does hold water.\n\n\nNative Well - An isolated natural depression which holds water, not within Watercourses. The natural phenomena is sometimes improved by indigenous persons for their own water collection purposes.\n\n\nPool - A small body of still or standing water, permanent or temporary in an isolated natural depression, not within Watercourses.\n\n\nRockhole - A hole excavated in solid rock by water action. \n\n\nSoak - A depression holding moisture after rain, especially the damp or swamp spots around the base of granite rocks.\n\n\nSpring - A place where water issues from the ground naturally.\n\n\nWaterfall Point - A sudden descent of water over a step or ledge in the bed of a watercourse.\n\n\nWaterhole - A natural depression which holds perennial water, within a non-perennial watercourse or a non-perennial lake.\n\n\nWater Tank - Water Tanks are storage containers for water, usually used for human consumption and other purposes such as irrigation, agriculture, fire suppression, agricultural farming and livestock, chemical manufacturing and food preparation. Water Tanks are constructed of various materials including plastic (polyethylene or polypropylene), fiberglass, reinforced concrete, steel (welded or bolted, carbon or stainless). Those used for human consumption are generally fully enclosed.\n\n\nFor more information please visit the Geoscience Australia Web Service Portal.\nPlease note: \n\nThis dataset is a snapshot of Geoscience Australia's web service dataset as on 2019-03-12\n",

    "description": "This dataset presents the footprint of the crude percentage of adults who have uncontrolled high blood pressure. Uncontrolled high blood pressure (measured high blood pressure) is defined as including any of the following; measured systolic blood pressure of 140 mmHg or more, or; diastolic blood pressure of 90 mmHg or more, and; irrespective of the use of blood pressure medication. As an indication of the accuracy of estimates, 95% confidence intervals were produced. These were calculated by the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) using standard error estimates of the proportion. The data spans the financial year of 2014-2015 and is aggregated to 2015 Department of Health Primary Health Network (PHN) areas, based on the 2011 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nHealth risk factors are attributes, characteristics or exposures that increase the likelihood of a person developing a disease or health disorder. Examples of health risk factors include risky alcohol consumption, physical inactivity and high blood pressure. High-quality information on health risk factors is important in providing an evidence base to inform health policy, program and service delivery.\nFor further information about this dataset, visit the data source: Australian Institute of Health and Welfare - Health Risk Factors in 2014-2015 Data Tables.\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data using the Department of Health - PHN Areas.\n\n\nThe health risks factors reported are known to vary with age and the different PHN area populations are known to have a range of age structures. As such, comparisons of results between the PHN areas should be made with caution because the crude rates presented do not account for these age differences.\n\n\nAdults are defined as persons aged 18 years and over.\n\n\nValues assigned to \"n.p.\" in the original data have been removed from the data.\n\n\nData for PHN701 (Northern Territory) should be interpreted with caution as the National Health Survey excluded discrete Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities and very remote areas, which comprise around 28% of the estimated resident population of the Northern Territory living in private dwellings.\n\n",

    "description": "The \"Clearing Control Catchments - CAWSA\" dataset relates to Country Areas Water Supply Act 1947 (CAWSA) Part IIA Control of Catchment Areas legislation for controlling the clearing of native vegetation to prevent salinisation of water resources in some existing or potential water source catchments. The dataset is used by the Department of Water and Environmental Regulation in administering clearing licence applications, policy decision making and for providing advice.\n\nThe catchments depicted were proclaimed 1976-1978 and became subject to clearing\ncontrols where land owners and occupiers could not clear native vegetation on their property unless authorised under a CAWSA Licence to Clear. The \"Clearing Control Catchments - CAWSA\" dataset also shows Zones of salinity risk in the controlled catchments where Zone A is the highest salinity risk and Zone D the lowest. These zones were used to determine where, in the administration of clearing controls, some limited clearing may be granted in areas of lower salinity risk.\n\nSince the advent of Environmental Protection Act 1986 (EP Act) clearing regulations in 2004, native vegetation clearing proponents state-wide must obtain an EP Act Permit before undertaking any clearing. Landowners and occupiers of CAWSA compensated land and those exempt from the need for an EP Act clearing Permit are however still required to obtain a CAWSA Licence to Clear.\n\nThis dataset was formerly known as CAWSA Part 2A Clearing Control Catchments (DOW-028)",

    "description": "Despite the important role Symbiodinium might play we currently have limited knowledge of the distribution ranges of Symbiodinium on the Great Barrier Reef. In order to increase our knowledge a database of Symbiodinium diversity on the GBR compiled from published papers (see database references) was established as part of a large research program 1.1 entitled ¿Risk, Resilience and Response Atlas for the Great Barrier Reef: Vulnerability to Coral Bleaching Project Objective.¿ The goal of project 1.1 is to define the vulnerability of GBR corals to climate change and extend this knowledge along the geographical extent of the GBR. The database presents an overview of the Symbiodinium types that have thus far been found across the GBR and can be accessed through the e-Atlas.\r\n\r\nUnderstanding Symbiodinium diversity and the geographical and environmental ranges of the different host/symbiont combinations will help us provide a better estimate of how vulnerable corals on the GBR are to bleaching.\r\n\r\n\r\nData Units:\r\n\r\nClade: a group of biological taxa or species that share features inherited from a common ancestor. In this case the genus Symbiodinium is divided in 9 clades A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I.\r\n\r\nSubclade: a term that is used in genetics to describe a subgroup. Often the different types or strain within a subclade differ only by 1 or 2 nucleotides. The clades (A, B, C, D or G) are accompanied by a number (for example C1) or a number and a letter (for example D1a) to distinguish between the different Symbiodinium types or strains within a subclade.\r\n\r\nDNA region: the DNA regions analyzed in order to differentiate betweenSymbiodinium clades and subclades differ in their resolution or in other words their ability to distinguish between different Symbiodinium types.\r\n- ITS1 = Internal Transcribed Spacer 1\r\n- ITS2 = Internal Transcribed Spacer 2\r\n- 18S rRNA = 18S small subunit ribosomal RNA\r\n\r\n\r\nData was extracted from the following papers:\r\n\r\nLoh et al., 2001; Van Oppen et al., 2001; LaJeunesse et al., 2003; Rodriguez-Lanetty et al., 2003; Ulstrup & Van Oppen, 2003; LaJeunesse et al., 2004a; Fabricius et al., 2004; Van Oppen et al., 2004, 2005a, 2005b; Ulstrup et al., 2006; Sampayo et al., 2007, 2008; Stat et al., 2008; Goulet et al., 2008a, 2008b; Jones et al., 2008; Ulstrup et al., 2008\r\n\r\n\r\nData Location:\r\n\r\nThis dataset is filed in the eAtlas enduring data repository at: data\\custodian\\funding\\MTSRF\\GBR_MTSRF-2-5i-2_UQ_Symbiodinium-clade_1998-2006",

    "description": "A data set of land use between June 2000 and June 2007 for New South Wales.  Land use is classified to three separate classification schemes.  These classification schemes are:3\n<ul>\n<li>NSW Land Use Mapping Program (LUMAP).</li>\n<li>NSW SCALD  (Standard Classification for Attributes of Land) Classification</li>\n<li>ALUM (Australian Land Use and Management) Classification.</li>\n</ul>\n\nThe LUMAP Classification is DECC's most recent classification for mapping of land use classes for NSW.  It is a simple numeric classification, open-ended to enable additional classes to be added.\n\nPrior to LUMAP, the SCALD classification was the standard for mapping of land use in NSW.  It is a combined alpha-numeric classification system.\n\nThe ALUM classification is based upon the modified Baxter &amp; Russell classification and presented according to the specifications contained in http://adl.brs.gov.au/mapserv/landuse/index.cfm?fa=app.ALUMClassification.\n\nVersion 6 of the classification describes the land use classes.  Earlier copies of the data set may have used Versions 4 or 5.\n\nThe mapping was commenced in April 2001 and completed by June 2007.  The date of the data set is set as the land use occurring at the time the satellite imagery was acquired, which can range from 1999 to 2006. This dataset was updated in May 2011 to include values in the vacant attribute fields of Source, Source Date, Source Scale, Reliability and LU Mapping Date.",

    "description": "Overview  \r\n Leadbeater's possum  Gymnobelideus leadbeateri  is a listed threatened species found mainly in montane ash and snowgum forests in the Central Highlands of Victoria, with a small occurrence in swamp forests in Yellingbo Nature Conservation Reserve. Threats to the species include wildfire, loss of hollow-bearing trees, and the harvesting of native forests. As a consequence, the species is a focus of sustainable forest management. \r\n\r\n The species was nominated for re-listing as Critically Endangered under the  Environmental Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act  (EPBC Act) in 2013, from its previous category of endangered, with comments on the nomination requested by January 2014. Its listing category was raised from Endangered to Critically Endangered in May 2015, based on the recommendation of the Threatened Species Scientific Committee. An updated Draft Recovery Plan for the species was then prepared with input from stakeholders. \r\n\r\n Over the period from 2013 to 2017, ABARES prepared briefing notes regarding the listing, conservation, recovery and management of Leadbeater's possum and the related issue of fire and forest harvesting. This publication brings together a series of these briefing notes. \r\n\r\n The briefing notes are presented as written at the dates indicated, except that occasional minor or typographical errors have been corrected, URLs updated, intra- and inter-departmental references removed, and footnotes now include clarifying amendments. The briefing notes are individually paginated. ",

    "description": "Urban Habitat Connectivity Project (UHCP)\n\nShort description: A package of data containing potential habitat and fragmentation for seven species groups in the urban ACT. Each species group has two layer files. Connected habitat layers show potential core and corridor habitat for the species group, and connectivity/fragmentation between these habitat patches. Remnant patches layers contain areas which are predicted to be fragmented and inaccessible for the species group, but may be important for restoration activities. These layers are outputs of ecological connectivity modelling and have been developed using spatial data representing habitat and connectivity requirements specific to the species group.\n\nThe following attributes are available in the data table for Connected Habitat layers:\n\n\n<ul><li>Species Group* - indicates the species group of interest</li><li>Patch ID – a unique identifier for each ‘patch’ of connected habitat, an ID that is given to group all habitat areas which are predicted to be connected to each other.</li><li>Habitat Type* – identifies if the polygon meets core or corridor habitat requirements, or if it is a remnant patch.</li><li>Habitat Number – a numeric value linked to Habitat Type to support statistics and symbology. Core habitat has a value of 0 and corridor habitat has a value of 1.</li><li>Patch Area (Ha)* – the area of the individual polygon in hectares.</li><li>Connected Habitat Area (Ha) – the total area of potential habitat in the connected patch, determined by summing the Patch Area for all polygons with the same Patch ID.</li><li>Shape area – the polygon’s area, calculated by default in meters squared.</li><li>Shape length – the length of the line enclosing the polygon, calculated by default in meters squared.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n* Is also available in the data table for Remnant Patches layers.\n\nSpatial resolution: 1:10,000\n\nCoordinate system: GDA2020 MGA zone 55\n\nMETHODS\n\nData collection / creation: <a>Spatial layers for habitat and barriers were created and input into a habitat connectivity/fragmentation model specifically designed for the species group. The model was developed using metrics derived from expert elicitation. These metrics quantified essential habitat and connectivity requirements for the species group, for example the preferred spacing of trees, the maximum crossable width of a road, the typical dispersal distance, etc. </a>The model identified habitat and barriers to connectivity, based on the metrics which could be mapped. Habitat was delineated by patch size to determine core and corridor habitat, and to remove areas which are too small to be functional. The habitat type is visible in the attribute table of the data.\n\nConnectivity between habitat patches is dependent on the species group’s dispersal capacity and the availability of core habitat, suitable corridors and a path without barriers. To assess this core habitat areas were buffered by the species group’s dispersal distance. This identified how far an individual will move to find a new core habitat patch. Movement to this distance is dependent on a suitable path. All habitat was buffered by the distance the species can move outside habitat (through non-habitat areas). This identified how far an individual will move outside any habitat (core or corridor) before they require another habitat patch (i.e. how far they can travel between stepping stones).Connectivity is further complicated by impassable barriers. Barriers were used to slice up the dispersal buffers and identify ‘dispersal patches’, areas which an individual can move within. Fragmentation is seen when a barrier is present, patches are too far from core habitat, or corridor habitat is too far apart.\n\nA unique ID was applied to each patch and represents connectivity/fragmentation. The patches were intersected with habitat to apply the new ID to the habitat areas. The final model outputs identify areas of potential core, corridor or remnant (inaccessible) habitat. Core and corridor habitat are viewable in the connected habitat dataset, whilst remnant patches are available separately. The data was simplified using the Douglas-Peuker algorithm, a tolerance of 0.5-2m, minimum size of 2-5m2 for retention, and holes filled in if less than 20m2. Small adjoining slithers &lt;20m2 were dissolved into neighbouring polygons to optimise drawing speeds. Please contact the project team for the model script or further details on the methodology.\n\nNOTES ON USE\n\nQuality: The habitat connectivity modelling used to produce the data was informed by work by the City of Melbourne <a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/331035992_Linking_Nature_in_the_City_A_framework_for_improving_ecological_connectivity_across_the_City_of_Melbourne\">(Kirk et al., 2018)</a>. The original methods were expanded on, with habitat and connectivity requirements (metrics) specific to the species group determined from expert elicitation and further analysis to consider patch size for core or corridor patches. The expert elicitation process provided the best and most relevant quantitative description of habitat and barriers available (for a species group rather than a specific species). The input datasets were then tailored to the metrics for this project. Existing datasets were refined to be relevant and reflect the metrics identified through expert elicitation. New datasets were created where data was missing. All data was derived from existing authoritative sources and/or remotely sensed data. This data curation process ensured the input datasets, and resulting output, were relevant and fit for purpose.\n\nLimitations: This data should be considered indicative only as there are limitations to the modelling process. It considers all habitat and barriers equally and as discrete objects (i.e. it applies a discrete boundary around a patch and does not account for gradients or flexible boundaries).The model predicts habitat and connectivity based on the data available. It does not assess whether a species is present or consider temporal variability. Some habitat requirements are not mapped (e.g. native vegetation, lack of predators) due to the lack of an accurate or complete dataset. Some of these requirements are critical to the success of the species group. These habitat requirements are available and have been derived from expert elicitation. They should be considered at an area of interest.\n\nThe model assumes the input data is up to date and accurate. Many of the habitat and barrier datasets used as inputs into the models are in some way informed by remote sensing data. Remote sensing data has limitations, such as potential for misclassification (e.g. bare ground and pavement could be confused). Additionally, remotely sensed data captures a point in time and will become outdated. Manual checks and improvements using supplementary data for specific sites have been completed to reduce as much error as possible.\n\nData refinement: Unmapped habitat and connectivity requirements should be considered when using the data. The full list of known habitat and connectivity requirements for each species group, including those considered by the model and those unaccounted for, is available by request. Other data may also be used to track changes post-LiDAR capture. For example, new development footprints may be used to remove non-habitat areas and can be done so at a faster rate than waiting for new LiDAR captures and re-running the model.\n\n\n\nSHARING\n\nLicenses/restrictions on use: Creative Commons By Attribution 4.0 (Australian Capital Territory)\n\nHow to cite this data: ACT Government, 2023.

The regions include the Upper North East, Lower North East, Southern, Eden, Brigalow – Nandewar, South Western Cypress and Riverina Red Gum. \nIFOAs integrate the regulatory regimes for environmental planning and assessment, protection of the environment and threatened species conservation. IFOAs incorporate licence conditions that protect soil, water and threatened species and their habitats. They also play a key role in the day-to-day planning and activities of the Forestry Corporation of NSW (FCNSW). \nThe terms and conditions under which all forestry operations (including logging) may occur in each region are set out in IFOAs and apply to anyone carrying out forestry operations on state forest and other Crown-timber land.\nThe Environment Protection Authority regulates FCNSW compliance with the non-licence terms, the environment protection licence and the threatened species licence components of the IFOAs, and the Department of Primary Industries – Fisheries regulates FCNSW compliance with the fisheries licence. Further information on IFOAs is available on the EPA website at \nhttp://www.epa.nsw.gov.au/forestagreements/IFOAs.htm",

    "description": "<b>Version 20 June 2016</b> \n(Overlay Dataset 3 of 4, needs to be used in conjunction with points, lines and North Lakes Locality datasets). \nThe Infrastructure Buffers Overlay is part of the Moreton Bay Regional Council Planning Scheme. MBRC Planning Scheme will help to respond to growth and development across the Moreton Bay Region. It is a statutory document regulating how land can be used and developed. The MBRC planning scheme replaces the three previous planning schemes created by the former Caboolture, Pine Rivers and Redcliffe councils.\n\n\nPlanning schemes use zones and overlays to show the location and extent of special features that need to be considered, such as where land may be subject to hazards or other characteristics. Overlay maps may apply to all or part of your property and your property may be affected by more than one overlay. Having an overlay on your property will only affect you if you intend to develop (i.e. extent or build, change use, subdivide, clear native vegetation, fill or excavate). \nThe attribute fields are defined as per Qld Planning Provisions, Schedule 2. The Queensland Planning Provisions (QPP) are the standard planning scheme provisions made by the Minister for Planning under Chapter 2, Part 5, Division 2 and Chapter 2, Part 6 of the Sustainable Planning Act 2009.",

The zones extend 20 kilometres either side of the state border and extend from the southern coastline up to the River Murray. This layer contains only the South Australian zones. This layer will mainly be used for administration purposes for water licensing. While this dataset was created in June 1998, the age of the zones is unknown and probably date back to early period of development of the South Australian/Victorian border agreement on groundwater.",

It is not energy consumption data captured by a meter, but modelled data based on building attributes such as building age, floor area etc. This data was provided by the CSIRO as a result of a study commissioned by IMAP Councils. The study was governed by a Grant Agreement between Councils and the CSIRO, which stated an intent for the data to be published. This specific dataset is presented at a block level scale. It includes both commercial and residential buildings and is a 2026 projection, relative to a 2011 baseline, based on a scenario of buildings being retrofitted.

    "description": "Urban Habitat Connectivity Project (UHCP)\n\nShort description: A package of data containing potential habitat and fragmentation for seven species groups in the urban ACT. Each species group has two layer files. Connected habitat layers show potential core and corridor habitat for the species group, and connectivity/fragmentation between these habitat patches. Remnant patches layers contain areas which are predicted to be fragmented and inaccessible for the species group, but may be important for restoration activities. These layers are outputs of ecological connectivity modelling and have been developed using spatial data representing habitat and connectivity requirements specific to the species group.\n\nThe following attributes are available in the data table for Connected Habitat layers:\n\n\n<ul><li>Species Group* - indicates the species group of interest</li><li>Patch ID – a unique identifier for each ‘patch’ of connected habitat, an ID that is given to group all habitat areas which are predicted to be connected to each other.</li><li>Habitat Type* – identifies if the polygon meets core or corridor habitat requirements, or if it is a remnant patch.</li><li>Habitat Number – a numeric value linked to Habitat Type to support statistics and symbology.

The model was developed using metrics derived from expert elicitation. These metrics quantified essential habitat and connectivity requirements for the species group, for example the preferred spacing of trees, the maximum crossable width of a road, the typical dispersal distance, etc. </a>The model identified habitat and barriers to connectivity, based on the metrics which could be mapped. Habitat was delineated by patch size to determine core and corridor habitat, and to remove areas which are too small to be functional. The habitat type is visible in the attribute table of the data.\n\nConnectivity between habitat patches is dependent on the species group’s dispersal capacity and the availability of core habitat, suitable corridors and a path without barriers. To assess this core habitat areas were buffered by the species group’s dispersal distance. This identified how far an individual will move to find a new core habitat patch. Movement to this distance is dependent on a suitable path. All habitat was buffered by the distance the species can move outside habitat (through non-habitat areas). This identified how far an individual will move outside any habitat (core or corridor) before they require another habitat patch (i.e. how far they can travel between stepping stones).Connectivity is further complicated by impassable barriers. Barriers were used to slice up the dispersal buffers and identify ‘dispersal patches’, areas which an individual can move within. Fragmentation is seen when a barrier is present, patches are too far from core habitat, or corridor habitat is too far apart.\n\nA unique ID was applied to each patch and represents connectivity/fragmentation. The patches were intersected with habitat to apply the new ID to the habitat areas. The final model outputs identify areas of potential core, corridor or remnant (inaccessible) habitat. Core and corridor habitat are viewable in the connected habitat dataset, whilst remnant patches are available separately. The data was simplified using the Douglas-Peuker algorithm, a tolerance of 0.5-2m, minimum size of 2-5m2 for retention, and holes filled in if less than 20m2. Small adjoining slithers &lt;20m2 were dissolved into neighbouring polygons to optimise drawing speeds. Please contact the project team for the model script or further details on the methodology.\n\nNOTES ON USE\n\nQuality: The habitat connectivity modelling used to produce the data was informed by work by the City of Melbourne <a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/331035992_Linking_Nature_in_the_City_A_framework_for_improving_ecological_connectivity_across_the_City_of_Melbourne\">(Kirk et al., 2018)</a>. The original methods were expanded on, with habitat and connectivity requirements (metrics) specific to the species group determined from expert elicitation and further analysis to consider patch size for core or corridor patches. The expert elicitation process provided the best and most relevant quantitative description of habitat and barriers available (for a species group rather than a specific species). The input datasets were then tailored to the metrics for this project. Existing datasets were refined to be relevant and reflect the metrics identified through expert elicitation. New datasets were created where data was missing. All data was derived from existing authoritative sources and/or remotely sensed data. This data curation process ensured the input datasets, and resulting output, were relevant and fit for purpose.\n\nLimitations: This data should be considered indicative only as there are limitations to the modelling process. It considers all habitat and barriers equally and as discrete objects (i.e. it applies a discrete boundary around a patch and does not account for gradients or flexible boundaries).The model predicts habitat and connectivity based on the data available. It does not assess whether a species is present or consider temporal variability. Some habitat requirements are not mapped (e.g. native vegetation, lack of predators) due to the lack of an accurate or complete dataset. Some of these requirements are critical to the success of the species group. These habitat requirements are available and have been derived from expert elicitation. They should be considered at an area of interest.\n\nThe model assumes the input data is up to date and accurate. Many of the habitat and barrier datasets used as inputs into the models are in some way informed by remote sensing data. Remote sensing data has limitations, such as potential for misclassification (e.g. bare ground and pavement could be confused). Additionally, remotely sensed data captures a point in time and will become outdated. Manual checks and improvements using supplementary data for specific sites have been completed to reduce as much error as possible.\n\nData refinement: Unmapped habitat and connectivity requirements should be considered when using the data. The full list of known habitat and connectivity requirements for each species group, including those considered by the model and those unaccounted for, is available by request. Other data may also be used to track changes post-LiDAR capture. For example, new development footprints may be used to remove non-habitat areas and can be done so at a faster rate than waiting for new LiDAR captures and re-running the model.\n\n\n\nSHARING\n\nLicenses/restrictions on use: Creative Commons By Attribution 4.0 (Australian Capital Territory)\n\nHow to cite this data: ACT Government, 2023.

Obtain detailed information on the biophysical oceanographic characteristics of these foraging habitats in both the GBR and Coral Sea regions using a range of biophysical parameters derived from satellite and in situ data; \n3. Quantify how prey availability at these sites varies with climate driven changes in biophysical oceanography; \n4. quantifying the level of prey availability and associated oceanographic conditions required to maintain viable reproduction at significant breeding colonies and 5) establish potential linkages and interactions between these areas/processes and other anthropogenic activities.",

    "title": "Feral pig habitat in northern Australia - wet season scenario",
    "description": "This dataset describes habitat suitability for feral pig breeding and persistence in northern Australia during the wet season. It is the result of a spatially-explicit, resource-based and regional-scale habitat model that integrated expert knowledge on feral pig breeding requirements and home range movements as well as seasonal variability in environmental conditions.\r\n\r\nThe modelled habitat suitability index (HSI) can theoretically range between 0 and 100, with higher values indicating better habitat quality for feral pig breeding. Due to modelling methods and assumptions, HSI values in this dataset effectively range between 11 and 81. They can be broadly classified as follows: HSI ≥ 60 = highly suitable habitat; HSI ≥ 40 = moderately suitable habitat; HSI < 40 = unsuitable habitat.\r\n\r\nPredicted habitat suitability should not be confused with actual feral pig occurrence. Individuals may be sighted at any time in unsuitable breeding habitat. Conversely, suitable breeding habitat may remain unoccupied. While there is a link between habitat suitability and population density, this may not always be straightforward (i.e. comparable habitat may carry vastly different actual or potential densities depending on the nature and quality of available resources).\r\n\r\nFeral pig habitat suitability in northern Australia was modelled for two seasonal scenarios. The wet season scenario captured favourable conditions during the late wet season, when resources required by feral pigs are generally abundant and widely distributed across the region. It was developed using spatial proxies averaged across two months (March/April) over five years (2010 to 2014). Seasonal model results were validated against four independent distributional data sets.\r\n\r\nUnderlying model parameters were elicited from experts. This dataset represents results from an expert-averaged model run. The model contained a variable \"Disturbance stress\" for which no spatial proxies were available. In this dataset, we assumed a uniformly “high” intensity and frequency of control activities, which likely overestimated disturbance and may undervalue habitat suitability in situations where there is actually little management.\r\n\r\nA detailed description of modelling methods and assumptions is provided in Froese et al. 2017 (https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0177018).",

    "description": "This dataset presents the footprint of the percentage of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander women who gave birth and had at least one antenatal visit in the first trimester. The data spans every two years between 2012-2016 and is aggregated to Statistical Area Level 4 (SA4) geographic areas from the 2011 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nThe Child and Maternal Health Indicators have been calculated from the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare (AIHW) National Mortality Database and Register of Births and National Perinatal Data Collection. This measure has been calculated with the numerator as the total number of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander women who gave birth and had at least one antenatal visit in the first trimester, and the denominator as the total number of mothers with a recorded week of gestation at the first antenatal visit.\nFor further information about this dataset, visit the data source:Australian Institute of Health and Welfare - Child and Maternal Health Data Tables.\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data.\n\n\nAn antenatal visit is a planned visit between a pregnant woman and a midwife or doctor to assess and improve the wellbeing of the mother and baby throughout pregnancy. An antenatal visit does not include a visit where the sole purpose of contact is to confirm the pregnancy, or those contacts that occurred during the pregnancy that related to other non-pregnancy related issues. An antenatal visit in the first trimester is defined as occurring before 14 weeks' gestational age.\n\n\nData at the area level exclude births to Australian non-residents and women who could not be allocated because their usual residence was not stated or was not valid\n\n\nIn WA and ACT, first antenatal visits that occur outside of the hospital may not be included, so these data should be interpreted with caution\n\n\nPercentage for an area are suppressed for publication and marked as 'NP' if the number of mothers with a recorded week of gestation at the first antenatal visit for the area is less than 100\n\n",

    "description": "The atomic interstellar medium shows tiny-scale optical depth fluctuations on the scale of 0.1~10,000 AU, whose origin and nature are poorly understood. The existence of this Tiny-Scale Atomic Structure (TSAS) has significant implications, potentially calling into question our fundamental understanding of heating, cooling and dynamical processes in the interstellar medium. Yet observations remain sparse. This long-term project plans to search for temporal variations in HI absorption spectra seen against background pulsars to characterise TSAS in the Milky Way interstellar medium (ISM). These observations constitute the largest number of sightlines and densest temporal sampling ever performed in a single experiment, and will test predictions that TSAS is the tail end of a turbulent cascade, constrain its minimum size scale (down to resolutions of ~0.05 AU) and potentially provide the first direct measurements of pressures in \"large\" TSAS features of &gt; 1000 AU. We make use of the phase-resolved spectral line mode that we have recently implemented on Parkes, which has cut data rates and processing times by factors of ~1000 compared to past studies. This is an expansion of our pilot P1321 to a long term study.",

    "description": "## **Abstract** \n\nThe dataset was derived by the Bioregional Assessment Programme from a derived dataset (38f3a272-66cc-4fe2-bef9-ff4aedf6fc24). The source dataset is identified in the Lineage field in this metadata statement. The processes undertaken to produce this derived dataset are described in the History field in this metadata statement.\n\n\n\nThe dataset is a shapefile for 16 catchments in the Gloucester area selected to calibrate the surface water model. Out of the 16, four contribute to the Gloucester or Karuah river basins, including the Barrington River at Forbesdale (calibration gauge 208006), Gloucester River at Gloucester (208020), Mammy Johnsons River at Pikes Crossing (209002) and Karuah River at Dam site (209018). Of the remaining catchments, five are in the Manning river basin, six are in the Hunter river basin and one is in the Wallis Lake river basin..\n\n## **Dataset History** \n\nThe catchment boundaries were delineated using 1 sect SRTM DEM dataset with 16 selected gauge locations as pour points (see lineage dataset). The new boundaries are better (for modelling purposes) than those delineated using the BOM's Geofabric for all catchments, except for the catchment 209003 where a flaw in the SRTM derived flowpath excluded a valley when compared with the Geofabric. This catchment was manually edited to conform with the Geofabric representation of 209003.

    "description": "The Biodiversity component of the LTIM Project evaluated the contribution of Commonwealth environmental water to achieving diversity-related objectives of the Basin Plan by undertaking a qualitative evaluation of expected outcomes of watering actions undertaken by the Commonwealth Environmental Water Office (CEWO). \r\n\r\nThe CEWO’s LTIM Project focused on examining the contribution of Commonwealth environmental water to the environmental objectives of the Basin Plan 2012 (Basin Plan), while assisting the CEWO to demonstrate environmental outcomes and adaptively manage the water holdings. Monitoring and evaluation was focused in seven Selected Areas:were the Junction of the Warrego and Darling rivers, Gwydir river system, Lachlan river system, Murrumbidgee river system, Edward/Kolety-Wakool river system, Goulburn River and Lower Murray River. These areas will continue to be monitored through the CEWO’s Monitoring, Evaluation and Research (MER) Program.  \r\n\r\nData collected by monitoring at Selected Areas is used to evaluate local outcomes from watering and also contributed to the analysis and evaluation of Basin Plan objectives.\r\n\r\nThe main data output of the Biodiversity evaluation is an aggregated list of species and communities that potentially benefitted from Commonwealth environmental water from 2014-15 to 2018-19. This is derived from other Basin Matter reports (Vegetation, Fish, Ecosystem Diversity), Selected Area monitoring, the Atlas of Living Australia and monitoring programs external to LTIM (e.g. the Living Murray, Bird Life Australia). \r\n\r\nPlease refer to the Murray-Darling Basin LTIM Project: 2018-19 Basin-scale evaluation of Commonwealth environmental water – Biodiversity Report for the detailed method on data used for evaluation.

It considers available statistical evidence on the financial and accommodation aspects of housing decisions and draws out some of the policy issues affecting the wellbeing of older Australians and the broader community.\r\nThe report examines the policies affecting the supply and cost of residential aged care and other age-specific housing, the influence of the tax and transfer system on housing decisions, and the issues in using home equity release to support living standards in retirement.\r\nIn reaching its conclusions, the Commission drew on evidence from a survey of older Australians conducted on its behalf. The Commission engaged RFi Group to conduct a national survey of older Australians on the reasons for housing decisions relevant to this study.\r\nThe survey was conducted online in September 2015, and involved 1500 Australians aged over 60 years. Key results from the survey are presented throughout the report. A more detailed description of survey methodology is given in appendix C.\r\n",

    "title": "Results of benthic organisms, reef fishes and manta tow surveys of Capricorn Bunker reefs in October 2015 (NESP TWQ 3.7, AIMS)",
    "description": "This dataset consists of summaries of benthic, fish and manta tow surveys conducted in the Capricorn-Bunker Region of the Great Barrier Reef in October 2015. It consists of three tables:\n\n1. A table summarising percent cover of benthic organisms grouped into broad categories from photo transects collected during the monitoring surveys.\n2. A table of average abundance for each reef fish species on the 5 transects in each of the three sites on each reef is presented for the eight reefs surveyed.\n3. A table of the average reef wide coral cover, the mean reef-wide density of crown-of-thorns starfish (CoTS), Acanthaster planci and the mean reef-wide density of coral trout for each reef based on manta tow surveys.\n\nThis dataset is an extract from part of the AIMS Long Term Monitoring database.\n\nThe rezoning of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park (GBRMP) in 2004 increased the number and extent of ¿no-take¿ areas within the Park. This project surveys pairs of reefs, one in a ¿no-take¿ or green zone and the other a similar reef where fishing is allowed (blue zone), in five regions of the GBRMP. Green and blue zones will be surveyed for the abundance and size of fishery species, particularly coral trout, as well as wider effects on coral reef communities. Surveys of coral communities are undertaken in the same location as surveys of fishes. Biennial surveys commenced in 2006.\n\n\nMethods:\n\nBenthic surveys:\nCoral communities were surveyed on eight reefs (Boult Reef, Broomfield Reef, Erskine Reef, Fairfax Islands Reef, Hoskyn Islands Reef, Lady Musgrave Reef, Mast Head Reef, North Reef (North)) in the Capricorn-Bunkers region using digital still images taken along five permanent 50 m transects in each of three sites per reef (n = 15 transects). Forty images were selected randomly from the fifty taken per transect for analyses. The benthic organisms under five points per image arranged in a quincunx pattern were identified (n = 200 points per transect). Benthic organisms were identified to the highest taxonomic resolution possible and each organism is assigned a lifeform based on its shape. Data were converted to percent cover and the site averages is presented for each reef surveyed. AIMS LTMP Standard Operating Procedure 10.  The data summaries the latest survey from a time-series of biennial surveys that commenced in 2006. Temporal trends at each reefs are available on http://data.aims.gov.au/reefpage2/allreefs.jsp\n\nReef fish surveys:\nThe abundance of ten families of conspicuous, diurnally active reef fishes was enumerated using standard underwater visual census techniques. Sites are located in a standard reef slope habitat on the north-eastern flank of each reef between 6 to 12m, and consist of five permanently marked 50 m transect (n=15 per reef). Damselfishes (Pomacentridae) were surveyed on one metre wide belt transects while the remaining nine families of large mobile fishes (Acanthuridae, Chaetodontidae, Labridae, Lethrinidae, Lutjanidae, Scaridae, Siganidae, Serranidae and Zanclidae) were counted on five metre wide belts. See AIMS LTMP Standard Operating Procedure 3.\n\nManta tow surveys:\nBroadscale surveys of reef-wide coral cover, densities of crown-of-thorns starfish and of coral trout using manta tows involve a snorkel diver being towed around the perimeter of the reef.  The boat stops every 2 min to allow data to be recorded. See AIMS LTMP Standard Operating Procedure 9.\n\n\nFormat:\n\nCapBunk_NESP-TWQ-3-7_AIMS_Benthic_2015-10.csv, CapBunk_NESP-TWQ-3-7_AIMS_Benthic_2015-10.shp:\nAverage percent cover of groups of benthic organisms on each of 3 sites on survey reefs in the Capricorn-Bunkers, GBR\nDescription of lifeforms are published in the Standard Operation Procedures, Appendix III\nSee: AIMS LTMP Standard Operating Procedure 10\n\nThe following are the classifications in the dataset:\n- Turf algae\n- Tabulate Acropora\n- Coralline algae\n- Branching Acropora\n- Encrusting non-Acropora\n- Sand\n- Massive non-Acropora\n- Macroalgae\n- Submassive non-Acropora\n- Soft coral\n- Digitate Acropora\n- Arb & Enc Soft Coral\n- Arborescent Soft Coral\n- Capitate Soft Coral\n- Foliose non-Acropora\n- Encrusting Acropora\n- Millepora\n- Branching non-Acropora\n- Submassive Acropora\n- Sponge\n- Other organisms\n- Encrusting Soft Coral\n- Zoanthid\n- Bottlebrush Acropora\n- Dead coral (recent)\n- Rubble\n- Lobate Soft Coral\n- Massive Soft Coral\n- Mushroom coral\n- Abiotic\n- Solitary coral\n- Unknown\nThe shapefile was created from the CSV. This process involved truncating the attribute names to comply with 10 character limit of the shapefile format. The CapBunk_NESP-TWQ-3-7_AIMS_Benthic_2015-10.aliases.csv file contains a lookup table that maps the shortened attribute names in the shapefile to the original longer names in CSV file.\n\nCapBunk_NESP-TWQ-3-7_AIMS_Fish_2015-10.csv:\nConsists of a summary of the raw counts of reef fishes. The average abundance for each reef fish species per 1,000 m2  is presented for each of the 3 sites on the eight reefs surveyed in October 2015. Note: this table also includes rows for species that were searched for, but none were observed. These correspond to rows where the abundance is 0.\n\nCapBunk_NESP-TWQ-3-7_AIMS_Manta-tow_2015-10.csv:\nSummary of the manta tow results for the surveyed reefs, including the mean hard coral cover (average over all tows on reef), CoTS (count per tow) and trout (count per tow). \n\n\nData Location:\n\nThis dataset is saved in the eAtlas enduring data repository at: data\\NESP1\\3.7_GBR_Zoning\\",

This data describes the areas and type of woody vegetation\nchange (loss) based on the analysis of multi-date Landsat imagery covering NSW.\nThis data is based on a biennial LANDSAT coverage between 1988-2006 and annual coverage 2006-2010. LANDSAT Imagery 1988-2008 was processed by Geoscience Australia at 25m resolution.\n2008 onwards is based on USGS processed LANDSAT at 30m resolution. Note, this vector data may generate slightly different aerial statistics to those generated from the source raster data. This is due to variation caused by the data transformation and vector cleaning processes applied in generating the vector data.",

    "title": "Assessment of Swamp Sclerophyll Forest on Coastal Floodplains TEC on NSW Crown Forest Estate  (South Coast Region)",
    "description": "The operational map for Swamp Sclerophyll Forest (SSF) was constructed to resolve long-standing issues surrounding its identification, location and extent within the NSW State Forest estate covered by the coastal Integrated Forestry Operation Agreements. The map was constructed in two parts, with State Forests to the north of Sydney being mapped in a separate process to those to the south of Sydney. We did this to minimise the risk that relationships between regional vegetation communities and the TEC would be confounded or masked by geographical variation or other major ecological gradients, which might otherwise be a significant risk if we had treated the full latitudinal range of the TEC as a single study area. In total, we assessed 1,218,000 hectares of State Forest across coastal NSW. This consisted of 868,000 hectares of State Forest on the north coast and more than 350,000 hectares of State Forest on the south coast.\nIn both study areas, the project’s Threatened Ecological Community (TEC) Reference Panel (the Panel) preceded the assessment process by reviewing the determination for SSF and agreeing upon a set of diagnostic parameters for its identification.  The Panel found that SSF is primarily defined by floristic plot data and that it is mostly located on coastal floodplains and associated alluvial landforms.\nFollowing on from these conclusions, we started the mapping process by mapping the distribution of floodplains and alluvial soils and thus identifying possible areas of SSF. For both the north and the south coast we used an existing map of coastal landforms and geology in combination with several fine-scale models of alluvial landform features to determine the likely extent of floodplains and alluvial soils within our study areas. \nWe used aerial photograph interpretation (API) to assess the floristic and structural attributes of the vegetation cover on our modelled alluvial environments, and thus delineated polygons likely to contain SSF. We also used API to modify the boundaries of the modelled alluvial areas using a prescribed list of eucalypt, casuarina and melaleuca species in combination with the interpretation of landform elements relevant to alluvial and floodplain environments.\nWe then compiled floristic plot data for all State Forest areas within our modelled alluvial landforms and API polygons. For both the north and the south coast the floristic plot data was sourced from both existing flora surveys held in the OEH VIS database and from targeted flora surveys conducted specifically for this project. We compared these plots with those previously assigned to flora communities listed in the determination of SSF. Both dissimilarity-based methods and multivariate regression methods were used for the comparison. The results of the comparison were then used to assess the likelihood that the plots in State forests belonged to one or more of the communities listed in the SSF determination.\nFollowing this, we developed a predictive statistical model of the probability of occurrence of SSF using plot data and a selection of environmental and remote-sensing variables. For the north coast, we used a Random Forest model, while for the south coast we used a Boosted Regression Tree model.\nTo create the operational map, we assigned every mapped API polygon to SSF if appropriate based on the plot data, over-storey and understorey attributes, landform features and modelled probabilities underlying each API polygon. In total, we mapped approximately 1131 hectares of SSF across out study area.\nOperational TEC Mapping have been derived by API at a viewing scale between 1-4000 using ADS40 50 cm pixel imagery and 1 m derived LIDAR DEM grids for floodplain EECs.",

Information on the number of visitors and the number of visitor days (visitors X length of stay) is collected on a weekly basis, based on entry pass sales information.  Visitation by visitors entering on single or multiple day passes is readily determined from actual pass sales, whilst visitation by the holders of season entry passes is based on estimates.\nCommencing in 2006, the Alpine Resorts Co-ordinating Council and the Alpine Resort Management Boards have conducted a consistent survey of visitation by season entry pass holders at all resorts, to better estimate visitation.  Each season entry pass holder is sent a survey card and asked to fill in details of their visits (including length of stay and passenger numbers) and return their survey cards to the Council.\nAt the end of the winter season, following analysis of the survey returns, Council adjusts the figures from the final week of the winter season to produce the annually-published ‘End-of-Season’ results.",

Not all assets within the network are owned, and maintained by Brisbane City Council.\n\nA Stormwater Quality Improvement Device or SQID is a device used to prevent polluting materials being transported in stormwater. There are four main types of SQID: Filter, Gross Pollution Trap (GPT), Trash Rack and Wetland. A filter is used to block finer particles and sediments. A GPT is used to block debris typically larger than 3mm. A Trash Rack is a series of metal vertical and/or horizontal metal bars positioned across a drainage channel and designed to intercept litter and debris. A wetland is a naturally occurring area inundated or saturated by surface or groundwater and capable of sustaining vegetation typically adapted for life in such conditions.",

A planting schedule for streets in each precinct has been developed in consultation with the community and is based on:\n\n-  Community priorities\n\n-  Location and density of vulnerable residents\n\n-  Opportunities for new planting\n\n-  Hot and very hot streets, as shown in thermal imaging \n\n-  Useful Life Expectancy of existing trees\n\n-  Existing canopy cover\n\n\n\nThis dataset shows the anticipated timeframe for tree planting in each street across the City of Melbourne. This timing is provisional and subject to change. The schedule for some streets may be moved forward or delayed by capital works, developments or renewal projects that impact on tree planting or survival. \n\n\n\nTo learn more about the Urban Forest Strategy and Precinct Plans, visit http://www.melbourne.vic.gov.au/sustainability/urbanforest/pages/urbanforest.aspx",

    "description": "This dataset was collected as part of the City of Melbourne's Census of Land Use and Employment (CLUE). The data shows the number of business establishments per city (CLUE) block, classified by their CLUE industry (from ANZSIC) and small area allocation. The data is aggregated to the 2016 Blocks for CLUE Boundaries and covers the year period of 2009.\nA business establishment is defined as a \n\n\nCommercial occupant in a building\n\n\nSeparate land use\n\n\nAny permanent presence of economic activity in accordance with standard Industry classification (ANZSIC).\n\n\nHence, if one organisation has its presence in several buildings in the CLUE area, each time it will be counted as a separate establishment. Consequently, the count of establishments presented in CLUE represents the number of locations, rather than 'enterprises'.\nFor more information please visit the City of Melbourne CLUE Portal and ABS ANZSIC Page.\nPlease note: \n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the data acquired through the City of Melbourne Open Data Portal.\n\n\nThe individual yearly tables have been extracted from the archived 2002-2017 tables.\n\n\nThe data in this table is a snapshot and not live.\n\n",

    "title": "Transitional native vegetation regulatory (NVR) map - category 2-vulnerable regulated land",
    "description": "The transitional NVR - category 2-vulnerable regulated land layer is a component of the transitional NVR map. The transitional NVR Map was prepared by Department of Planning and Environment (DPE) under Part 5A of the Local Land Services Act 2013 (LLS Act) and supporting Local Land Services Regulation 2014.  Category 2-vulnerable regulated land for this layer is taken to include land designated as steep or highly erodible land, protected riparian land or special category land.\n\nThe 2022 annual review of the transitional NVR map was published on 23 March 2022. Please read below for details about changes occurring as a result of the 2022 annual review. The latest version of the map can be viewed online using the transitional NVR Map viewer.\n\nhttps://www.lmbc.nsw.gov.au/Maps/index.html?viewer=NVRMap\n\nThe category 2-vulnerable regulated land layer indicates where clearing of native vegetation may not be permitted under the Land Management (Native Vegetation) Code 2017, and a limited suite of allowable activities apply)\n\nCategory 2-vulnerable regulated land is comprised of three layers. These being:\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://datasets.seed.nsw.gov.au/dataset/vulnerable-land-protected-riparian73a9e\">Vulnerable Riparian</a>. Generated from the NSW Hydroline and HydroArea dataset, natural named watercourses were used to capture streams with a buffer applied to both watercourses and water-bodies. \nThree datasets have been generated by creating buffers in the original dataset.</li>\n</ul>\n\nA 20-meter buffer was used for both sides of the bank to represent the no-clearing boundary within the banks of major streams, lakes and lagoons. The buffer polygon created includes the bed of the stream, lakes and lagoons. \n\nA 22.5-meter buffer was applied on either side streams mapped by hydroline. It was assumed that the average stream width for a stream represented by a stream centre line is 5m.\n\nFor minor streams mapped by hydroline, a 10m buffer was applied either side of the stream.\n\nVulnerable - Steep Land, generated from 5m elevation data (courtesy Dept. Customer Service). This product has currently been generated for all MGA Zones in NSW 54,55 and 56. \n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://datasets.seed.nsw.gov.au/dataset/vulnerable-land-special-category414af\" title=\"Special category\">Special Category Land</a>. A selection of land susceptible to erosion or land that is otherwise environmentally sensitive, such as mass movement and salinity. </li>\n</ul>\n\nChanges to the mapping of category 2-vulnerable regulated land introduced in the publish of the revised transitional NVR Map on 23 March 2022 have resulted from the changes to the transitional NVR - land excluded from the LLS Act layer and also the refinement of the mapping of steep slopes land (&gt;18 degrees slope). Availability of more detailed elevation data (5m ELVIS DEM) for New South Wales has resulted in changes for steep land mapping in Eastern NSW (MGA Zone 56).\n\nThe data is provided as multi value raster that identifies the category 2-vulnerable regulated land, category 2-sensitive regulated land and where category 2-sensitive and category 2-vulnerable regulated land overlaps.\n\nPixel values:\n\n3 - category 2-vulnerable regulated land \n\n4 - category 2-sensitive regulated land \n\n6 - where category 2-sensitive and category 2-vulnerable regulated land overlap (display class)  \n\nSpatial datasets compiled in the category 2-vulnerable regulated land layer are sourced from Department Planning and Environment.\n\nData on the transitional NVR map viewer is updated on a monthly basis for minor data changes. https://www.lmbc.nsw.gov.au/Maps/index.html?viewer=NVRMap\n\nPlease contact Department of Planning and Environment data broker on data.broker@environment.nsw.gov.au for additional information.",

    "description": "This dataset comprises the phytoplankton abundance and biovolume estimates of a broader sampling program carried out by the Plankton National Reference Station within the Integrated Marine Observing system. Regular monthly phytoplankton samples are undertaken at the stations as part of a larger water sampling program by the Australian National Reference Stations. In total nine stations are sampled regularly around the Australian coastline. Sampling is conducted monthly (Esperance and Ningaloo 3 monthly) off small vessels at each of the nine reference stations. The sampling is an integrated water sample collected with niskin bottles at 10m depth intervals and preserved in lugols solution. The depth of the sample varies at each station. The plankton ecology lab (based in Queensland) will analyse the samples collected for: 1. Community composition / abundance (cells/l) 2. Biovolume (um3/L). Data storage and access is planned to be interoperable with other national and international programs through the IMOS Infrastructure. Station metadata can be found through this resource. Data is available freely via the AODN portal: https://portal.aodn.org.au. As the taxonomic resolution of the data has changed over time, due to continual training, it is important that users refer to the change log tables included in your data download. These will provide information on the validity of the taxa, from what date we have been identifying certain taxa etc. Classification fields may be blank depending on the level to which that taxa has been identified, i.e. if only identified to family, genus and species will be blank.",

It comprises a digital map showing the locations of some abandoned penguin colonies (represented by points) and a linked digital database containing additional information. The importance of these sites derives from the fact that a chronology of penguin occupation can be established by radiocarbon dating and this in turn provides a minimum age for deglaciation of the Windmill Islands.\n\nThese data were compiled by Dr Ian D Goodwin from his own field notes and from the records of other workers.

    "description": "\n\n\nUpper Murrumbidgee Waterwatch engages the community in the environment through monitoring and caring for our catchments. We educate and raise awareness in schools and the community on issues concerning catchment health and we use data collected by volunteers to inform policy and on ground catchment management.\nUpper Murrumbidgee Waterwatch volunteers collect data on water quality, waterbug diversity and abundance, and riparian vegetation condition at over 200 sites in the catchment. To use these data to assess the health of our waterways and the broader catchment, sites are grouped into reaches (segments of waterways and/or related waterbodies) and the data are summarised and presented by reach. To ensure that data collected from a small number of sites can be considered representative of a reach, reaches consist of similar sections of waterway as defined by criteria including the size (magnitude / stream order), surrounding land uses, and underlying geology of the included waterways and waterbodies.\nThis dataset contains annual scores of the water quality, waterbug diversity and abundance, riparian vegetation condition and overall health of individual reaches (stretches of waterway) in the Upper Murrumbidgee River catchment, 2015 - 2024. Scores are calculated from monthly water quality data collected by Upper Murrumbidgee Waterwatch volunteers, and waterbug and riparian vegetation assessments conducted by Waterwatch staff. Detailed methods can be found in the <a href=\"https://www.act.waterwatch.org.au:443/data/chip-reports\">Catchment Health Indicator Program (CHIP) reports </a>produced each year by Upper Murrumbidgee Waterwatch: <a href=\"https://www.act.waterwatch.org.au:443/data/chip-reports\">https://www.act.waterwatch.org.au/data/chip-reports</a>\nThe data are best viewed using the <a href=\"https://experience.arcgis.com/experience/bf04e20bd88b4896854d86007d94eea3\">Waterwatch interactive map and data dashboard</a>.",

    "description": "The advent of deep-sea drilling in the 1950's prompted the use of planktonic foraminifera (unicellular protozans) as palaeoceanographic indicators. They provide a natural archive of past environmental changes due to their global distribution, their prolific productivity and sensitivity to environmental variations. The most abundant species within core MD002361 is the subtropical species Gs. ruber. High abundances =30% are seen during the interglacial periods Marine Isotope Stages (MIS) 11, 9, 7, 5 with peak abundance (37.7%) during the Holocene. Other tropical and subtropical species follow this pattern. The transitional, deep dwelling species Gr. inflata has the most distinct abundance change within core MD002361. This species is absent during the interglacial periods but achieves high relative abundances (~20-30%) during glacial periods.",

    "description": "<strong><em>This dataset is available on Brisbane City Council’s open data website – <a href=\"https://data.brisbane.qld.gov.au\">data.brisbane.qld.gov.au</a>. The site provides additional features for viewing and interacting with the data and for downloading the data in various formats.</em></strong>  \n\nThis dataset, created in June 2013, provides an indication of the likelihood of a flood occurring from Brisbane River inside the Brisbane City Council local government area. This layer contributes to the overall Flood Awareness Mapping for Brisbane City Council.\n\nRiver flooding happens when widespread, prolonged rainfall occurs over the catchment of a river. As the river reaches capacity, excess water flows over its banks, causing flooding. River flooding can occur hours after the rain has finished, depending on the location within the catchment. The extent of river flooding depends on the severity of the weather and the capacity of the river among other things. The impact on a home depends on how close it is to the river and the proximity to low lying areas.\n\nThere are four different river flooding likelihood areas in Flood Awareness Map, namely High, Medium, Low and very low.\n\nThe river flood High likelihood layer consists of the 5% Annual Exceedance Probability (AEP) (20 year Average Recurrence Interval (ARI)) flood extent. The extent was sourced from Brisbane River Catchment Flood Study (BMT, 2017) which was commissioned by State Government.\n\nThe river flood Medium likelihood layer consists of the 1% AEP (100 year ARI) flood extent (outside high likelihood area). The extent was sourced from Brisbane River Catchment Flood Study (BMT, 2017) which was commissioned by State Government. \n\nThe river flood Low likelihood layer consists of the 0.2% AEP (500 year ARI) flood extent (outside high and medium likelihood areas). The extent was sourced from Brisbane River Catchment Flood Study (BMT, 2017) which was commissioned by State Government. \n\nThe river flood Very Low likelihood layer consists of the Extent of the 0.05% AEP (2000 year ARI) flood extent (outside high, medium and low likelihood areas). The extent was sourced from Brisbane River Catchment Flood Study (BMT, 2017) which was commissioned by State Government.",
