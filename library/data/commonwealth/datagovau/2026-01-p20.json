    "description": "Fast radio bursts are peculiar micro-millisecond duration transients, which have been seen to be extragalactic in origin. Since their discovery, a dichotomy has emerged in their population. Some FRBs have been seen to be repeating, while others have not been seen to be repeating. The repeating FRBs, such as FRB 20180301A, provide an unparalleled window into their circumburst environment due to their repeating nature, which can be used to constrain possible progenitor models and test underlying emission mechanisms. Additionally, FRB 20180301A has been seen to have interesting polarisation properties, such as a switch in the sign of RM, indicating a reversal in the magnetic field and a marked reduction in the linear polarisation fraction towards lower frequencies (depolarisation). The previous Parkes/Murriyang source follow-up has also revealed a temporal evolution in the dispersion measure (DM) of the source and tentative evidence for correlation in the DM and rotation measure (RM). The ultra-wideband low (UWL) receiver on Parkes/Murriyang is ideally suited to explore the wideband spectro-temporal and polarimetric behaviour of the source. We propose regular monitoring of FRB 20180301A using UWL to model the magnetic field evolution, study its circumburst media using depolarisation behaviour, and constrain any correlation of DM and RM.",

Includes the waterway name, a unique asset identifier, EPMS/asset section number (to link the object to associated drawings) and key attributes to assist with its intended purpose. \n\n\n\nWhen used in conjunction with the constructed waterways centreline and waterway connector centreline layers, this layer completes the waterway/hydrology linear network (complete centreline) for Melbourne Water’s non-underground drainage assets. \n\n\n\nData set is used to indicate the location and types of natural waterways for asset management and maintenance works, to assess buildover or planning applications, for waterway rehabilitation works and flow management (helping maintain the flow of water and reduce the impacts of floods), ongoing condition monitoring and hydrologic modelling and analysis and to assist with the planning and design, construction of new waterway corridors, stormwater management (WSUD) options.\n\n\n\nWaterway (Reach) layer created from original FIS 1:50K (Vicmap Hydro) streams data set which included only those waterways within catchments of greater than 60ha. Waterways (Reach) Rectification project undertaken 2001 to 2003 to review and correct the extent of the waterways reach network to ensure a complete data set exists (using the Drainage Metropolis Boundary, 50K data, 1:2500 Drainage Record Plans, Drainage Limits data, orthophotos, as constructed and/or design drawings, contour data and Melway Street Directory). Waterway (Reach) extents defined and attributes populated in GIS and AMIS for all records including assigning nodes and node numbers (for start / end points) and removing any reaches less than 100 metres in length that are predominantly channel assets. Waterways in extended area incorporated in 2005 using Vicmap Hydro data and aerial imagery, then updated in 2009/10 using Lidar survey data (contours). Data is maintained using Lidar survey data (contours) and 60 ha limits.

    "description": "This data was collected in October 2009 by the IMOS Ship of Opportunity Underway CO2 Measurement research group on RV Southern Surveyor (IMOS platform code: VLHJ) voyage ST032009.\n\nDeparted: \tHobart, Tasmania, October 10, 2009\nArrived:  \tSydney, New South Wales, October 14, 2009\n\nCO2 System Overview:\nThe fugacity of carbon dioxide (fCO2) in surface seawater was measured using a General Oceanics Inc. automated system (Model 8050; Pierrot et al 2009). Seawater is sprayed into an equilibration chamber and CO2 in the headspace gas equilibrates with the seawater. The headspace gas is pumped through a thermoelectric condenser followed by a nafion drying tube before flowing through a Licor 7000 non-dispersive infrared gas analyser used to measure the CO2 mole fraction (XCO2) of the dried air. The gas flow is stopped temporarily for the CO2 measurements, which are made at atmospheric pressure. A set of four CO2 standards that cover the range of CO2 values expected in the ocean are analysed about every four hours to calibrate the gas analyser. The standard gas concentrations are on the WMO-X2007 mole fraction scale for CO2-in-air. Atmospheric XCO2 (dry) is measured after the standards by pumping clean outside air from an intake on the forward mast of the ship. \n\nSeawater intake and ancillary data:\nThe seawater intake is located at about 5.5m depth in the bow of the ship. Sea surface salinity is measured using a thermosalinograph (Seabird Electronics SBE21) located next to the CO2 system. A remote temperature sensor (Seabird Electronics SBE 38) located at the intake is used to measure sea surface temperature (SST). The travel time between the intake and CO2 system is typically about 4 minutes with warming usually less than 0.6ºC. The thermosalinograph water is from the same intake, but the supply lines separate after the intake. A comparison of thermosalinograph and equilibrator temperature records shows the temperature difference in the two lines is generally less than 0.1ºC. The thermosalinograph water line travels outside the ship and is typically warmer than the equilibrator. The travel time in water line to the thermosalinograph is 2.5 minutes faster than to the equilibrator. \n\nMeteorological data, salinity, SST, and ships position and time are taken from the ships logging system. These parameters and the data quality are maintained by the Australian Marine National Facility.",

    "description": "The City of Melbourne has installed in-ground parking bay sensors in most CBD parking bays. These sensors record when a vehicle arrives and when it departs. Each record also includes the parking restriction for the bay and whether the vehicle has overstayed that restriction. This is the data for the 2016 calendar year.\n\n\n\n\n\nKnown data issues: \n\n\n\n1. There are 342,475 records that have the text ‘OLD’ at the end of the restriction in the field named ‘Sign’. This has been investigated and determined the text refers to one of two things, either: \n\n\n\n· At the time of the parking event the restriction that has been captured is correct but when the data was extracted from the server (July 2017) the restriction had since changed. \n\n\n\n· (Or) The particular sensor has since been replaced. \n\n\n\n2. There are a number of records that have a negative value in the duration in field ‘seconds’. This occurs due to a sensor detecting an arrival time being after the departure time. \n\n\n\n3. There are a number of records where the arrival and departure times have not been recorded. If the time has not been recorded the time is calculated from midnight of the arrival day to either midnight of the departure day or to the departure time. \n\n\n\nData that is excluded: \n\n\n\nIn the 2016 car parking event data there are 4,346 records where the parking event goes into 2017 and ends at midnight.\nDownload:\nDownload compressed CSV (1.07GB, 34.1 million rows)",

    "description": "This dataset presents counts of payment recipients by payment type for the quarter ending December 2018. The data is based on the recipient's geocoded address aggregated by Local Government Area (LGA) from the Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS) 2014.\nThe Department of Social Services (DSS) is the Australian Government's lead agency in the development and delivery of social policy, and is working to improve the lifetime wellbeing of people and families in Australia. DSS' policies and services respond to need across people's lives - looking after families, children and older people; providing a safety net for people who cannot fully support themselves; enhancing the wellbeing of people with high needs; assisting people who need help with care; and supporting a diverse and harmonious society. DSS supports people and families in Australia by encouraging independence and participation, and supporting a cohesive society.\nFor more information on this dataset please visit the Australian Government Open Data.\nFor further details on payments, see 'A guide to Australian Government payments'.\nPlease note:\n\n\nIn order to protect individuals' privacy, identified populations between 1 and 4 have been suppressed and replaced with '&lt;5' for confidentiality purposes. Additional data may be suppressed and replaced with 'n.p.' (not provided) to prevent the derivation of identified populations that have values of less than 5.\n\n\nIndividuals who live overseas, individuals who are without a valid home address and individuals who only have a postal address cannot be assigned to a locational boundary. State/territory totals derived from Local Government Area data will not match actual state and territory totals, due to different statistical geography methodologies.\n\n\nCaveats specific to payments type can be found in the relevant payment description of the original data.\n\n\nAURIN has spatialised this dataset and have made the following replacements to enforce data type consistency: \n\n\n'&lt;5' has been assigned a value of '-1' within the data\n\n\nA boolean field has been created for each data field to flag left-censored data. 'True' is assigned to fields that have been censored.\n\n\n'n.p.' (not provided) has been set to Null within the data.\n\n",

    "description": "A gravity core (GC14) was collected from a depth of 2004 mbsl within the Capricorn Channel, southern Great Barrier Reef (GBR). Isotopic values for 18-O and 13-C were obtained from : Globigerinoides ruber and correlated with the SPECMAP age-model. It appears that the core extends back to MIS 3 (Marine Isotope Stage). From limited depth matching with the Martinson et al. (1987) SPECMAP age-model it is extremely difficult to determine a sedimentation rate, however, it exhibits a relatively uniform rate throughout the core of ~4cm/kyr. This is a fairly high sedimentation rate for a core this distal and abyssal.",

    "description": "This dataset presents the footprint of the number and rate of overnight admitted mental health-related separations and bed days, with and without specialised psychiatric care by patient location. Overnight admitted patient separations refers to those separations when a patient undergoes a hospital’s formal admission process, completes an episode of care, is in hospital for more than one day and ‘separates’ from the hospital. The data spans the financial year of 2015-2016 and is aggregated to 2017 Department of Health Primary Health Network (PHN) areas, based on the 2016 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nThe data is sourced from the National Hospital Morbidity Database (NHMD) which is a compilation of episode-level records from admitted patient morbidity data collections in Australian hospitals. It includes demographic, administrative and length of stay data for each hospital separation. Clinical information such as diagnoses, procedures undergone and external causes of injury and poisoning are also recorded.\nMental health services in Australia (MHSA) provides a picture of the national response of the health and welfare service system to the mental health care needs of Australians. MHSA is updated progressively throughout each year as data becomes available. The data accompanies the Mental Health Services - In Brief 2018 Web Report.\nFor further information about this dataset, visit the data source:Australian Institute of Health and Welfare - Mental health services in Australia Data Tables.\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data using the Department of Health - PHN Areas.\n\n\nRates are directly age-standardised.\n\n\nThe analysis of bed days presented in this table excludes those separations with a length of stay greater than 365 days.\n\n\nSeparations with a care type of Newborn (without qualified days), and records for Hospital boarders and Posthumous organ procurement have been excluded.\n\n\nIt is possible for patients to have multiple separations in any given reference period.\n\n",

    "description": "A gravity core (GC13) was collected from a depth of 1482 mbsl within the Capricorn Channel, southern Great Barrier Reef (GBR). Samples were separated into different size fractions to determine the % of each grainsize at each sample depth. Although not overly accurate, the information is correlated with analyses of other parameters to impart clues to the environmental changes within the core. The smallest size fraction (<100µm) dominates at all depths. Peaks in the larger grainsize fractions correlate with pteropod accumulations in the sediment, especially in the lower half of the core at 260cm and 290cm. The absence of complete pteropods at the top of the core may be related to the fact that GC13 is presently situated below the aragonite lysocline. This suggests that the aragonite lysocline was probably deeper during the glacials.",

    "description": "Groundwater Quality Restricted Use Zones (GQRUZ) are areas where there has been historic groundwater pollution as a result of previous industrial or other activities. These zones have been subject to clean up in line with the relevant environmental standards. However, restrictions remain on what the water can be used for if it is extracted via a groundwater bore.\n\nA GQRUZ remains when attempts have been made to clean up the groundwater at the affected site, but full clean-up was not possible - as it is often difficult to remove 100 per cent of groundwater pollution. It also may be impractical to clean up groundwater to the level needed to restore it to its original condition. EPA then identifies restrictions that should remain on how the water can be used without further treatment.\n\nGQRUZ do not represent a comprehensive list of all sites where groundwater quality may not be suitable for use. Rather, they represent locations where EPA has formally recognised that groundwater is polluted, following site investigations under EPA's environmental audit program. Other sources of information on groundwater quality include EPA's Priority Sites Register, which lists sites which are currently undergoing clean-up under EPA's compliance and enforcement activities.\n\nEvery effort has been made to ensure the accuracy of the GQRUZ data published. EPA will not be held liable or responsible for any errors, or for any loss incurred from reliance on this data. Further information about a GQRUZ can be found in the audit report for the selected site.\n\nThis dataset mirrors the GQRUZ data available on EPA's website interaction portal, but may not be up to date due to data transfer processes. For the most up to date data, go to EPA's website interaction portal.",

The location of the client is based on their place of usual residence. The data spans the financial years between 2014-2016 and is aggregated to 2015 Department of Health Primary Health Network (PHN) areas, based on the 2011 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS). \nThe data is sourced from the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare (AIHW) - National Hospital Morbidity Database (NHMD), which is a compilation of episode-level records from admitted patient care data collection systems in Australian hospitals in each state and territory. The NHMD is based on data provided to the AIHW by state and territory health authorities for the National minimum data set (NMDS) for Admitted patient care.\nFor further information about this dataset, visit the data source: Australian Institute of Health and Welfare - Indigenous Eye Health Measures 2017 Data Tables.\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data using the Department of Health - PHN Areas.\n\n\nThe data are crude rates.\n\n\nValues assigned to \"n.p.\" in the original data have been removed from the data.\n\n\nData by PHN should be interpreted with caution due to variations in admission practices, and because patients may be hospitalised outside the PHN where they reside.\n\n\nThe quality of data provided for Indigenous status varies. Time-series analyses may also be affected by changes in the quality of Indigenous identification over time.\n\n",

The data shows the number of business establishments per city (CLUE) block, classified by their ANZSIC1 industry and small area allocation. The data is aggregated to the 2016 Blocks for CLUE Boundaries and covers the year period of 2003.\nA business establishment is defined as a \n\n\nCommercial occupant in a building\n\n\nSeparate land use\n\n\nAny permanent presence of economic activity in accordance with standard Industry classification (ANZSIC).\n\n\nHence, if one organisation has its presence in several buildings in the CLUE area, each time it will be counted as a separate establishment. Consequently, the count of establishments presented in CLUE represents the number of locations, rather than 'enterprises'.\nFor more information please visit the City of Melbourne CLUE Portal and ABS ANZSIC Page.\nPlease note: \n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the data acquired through the City of Melbourne Open Data Portal.\n\n\nThe individual yearly tables have been extracted from the archived 2002-2017 tables.\n\n\nThe data in this table is a snapshot and not live.\n\n",

    "description": "\n<b>Moreton Bay City Flood Database</b>\nRiver and Creek Flooding \nVersion 3.1.0 (October 2023)\n\n\n\nThis theme shows river and creek flooding caused by long duration heavy rainfall, typically lasting between 1 hour and 1 day. Sometimes this rain falls over a whole catchment or a number of catchments. This extended period of heavy rainfall causes the water levels in the river or creek to rise and escape the main channel. It may take a number of hours or days for these floodwaters to rise, reach a peak and then subside. \n\n<i>Existing Conditions Maximum Scenario:</i> Maximum of modelled flood behaviour in rivers and creeks for different design rainfall events under existing climate and catchment conditions - with and without structure (bridges and culverts) blockage. \n<i>Purpose</i>: To determine flood levels and flows for different design rainfall events for design of infrastructure with and without bridges and culverts being blocked by debris. \n<i>Methodology:</i> Coupled hydrologic (WBNM) and hydraulic (TUFLOW) modelling using a two-dimensional regular grid, 1D culvert structures, 2D bridge structures and a design burst rainfall approach based on Australian Rainfall and Runoff 2019 guideline (ARR2019). Blockage calculated based on ARR2019 recommendations. <i>Refer technical publications available from Council's website for further detail.</i> \n<i>Flood Height:</i> Indicates the\napproximate water surface level of potential inundation during a\ncomputer-modelled flood event, expressed in meters above mean sea level. This dataset\nrepresents the flood height values as contour lines using a contour interval of\n0.2m.\n<i>Modelled Probability:</i> The probability of flooding represented by this dataset is: 0.1% Chance of Flooding in Any One Year\n\n<i>Likelihood: UnlikelyAnnual Exceedance Probability (AEP): 0.1%</i>\n\n<i>Average Recurrence Interval (ARI): 1,000 Year</i>\nA very large and very unlikely flood event. Over a very long period of time an event of similar size may occur on average once every 1,000 years.  Few people will ever witness an event of this size. When an event of this size is observed it is considered to be very exceptional. A river and creek flood event of similar size occurred in the middle reaches of the North Pine River during January 2011. Whilst very unlikely, it is possible for these events to occur.\n\n<i>Version Notes 3.1.0</i> - First edition of Generation 3 models, incorporating 2019 LiDAR, ARR2019 for Hydrology and TUFLOW HPC for Hydraulic modelling. All ARIs and all aspects. (BCR 5yr, 10yr, 50yr and 2000yr runs completed by CMB). BYR and MAR no structure blockage only. MAR ARR hazard calculated using WaterRIDE. (October 2023)\n<i>Version Resolution: 2.5m</i>\n<i>Data Reliability: A </i>\n<i>Indicates the flood data is of the highest available standard and has been prepared using the most recent flood model and input data </i>\n<i>Further Information: </i>For additional information on flooding in the Moreton Bay Region please see Council's website: <a href=\"https://www.moretonbay.qld.gov.au/Services/Property-Ownership/Flooding\">https://www.moretonbay.qld.gov.au/Services/Property-Ownership/Flooding</a>  ",

The echosounder's nominal frequency is 400 kHz (with a range of 200-700 kHz) and it operated in dual swath mode. This system was only operated in water depths typically shallower than 250 m.\n\nData are stored in <em>.kmall raw format for bathymetry and backscatter and </em>.kmwcd format for watercolumn backscatter at CSIRO. There are 31 files totalling 6.88 GB of raw data and 31 files totalling 69.1 GB of watercolumn data in this dataset. \n\nSound velocity profiles were applied to this data during data acquisition. Bathymetry data contained in *.kmall format are corrected for motion and position. \n\nGPS tide was computed using the EGM2008 model and applied to the processed data. Processed data has had outliers removed. \n\nAdditional information regarding this dataset, including further information on processing streams, is contained in the GSM data acquisition and processing report.",

    "title": "IMOS - SOOP Ocean Carbon Dioxide Data from RV Aurora Australis voyage AA1112V6 (Hobart-Hobart)",
    "description": "This data was collected in April/May2012 by the IMOS Ship of Opportunity Underway CO2 Measurement research group on RV Aurora Australis (IMOS platform code: VNAA) voyage AA1112V5.\n\nDeparted: \tHobart, Tasmania,  April 16, 2012\nArrived:  Hobart, Tasmania,  May 01, 2012\n\nCO2 System Overview:\nThe fugacity of carbon dioxide (fCO2) in surface seawater was measured using a General Oceanics Inc. automated system (Model 8050; Pierrot et al 2009). Seawater is sprayed into an equilibration chamber and CO2 in the headspace gas equilibrates with the seawater. The headspace gas is pumped through a thermoelectric condenser followed by a nafion drying tube before flowing through a Licor 7000 non-dispersive infrared gas analyser used to measure the CO2 mole fraction (XCO2) of the dried air. The gas flow is stopped temporarily for the CO2 measurements, which are made at atmospheric pressure. A set of four CO2 standards that cover the range of CO2 values expected in the ocean are analysed about every three hours to calibrate the gas analyser.  Atmospheric XCO2 (dry) is measured after the standards by pumping clean outside air from an intake on the forward mast of the ship. \n\nSeawater intake and ancillary data:\nThe seawater intake is at about 6 m depth. A remote temperature sensor (Seabird Electronics SBE38) located at the intake is used to measure sea surface temperature (SST). Sea surface salinity is measured using a thermosalinograph (Seabird Electronics SBE21) mounted in the oceanographic lab next to the pCO2 system. The travel time between the intake and CO2 system is typically about 70 seconds with warming usually less than 0.7ºC in cold waters near freezing. The thermosalinograph water is from the same intake and supply line. \n\nMeteorological data, salinity, SST, and ships position and time are taken from the ship’s logging system.",

    "description": "This dataset represents the intrinsic aquifer vulnerability to contamination evaluated for unconfined aquifers in Fitzroy, based on the DRASTIC method (Aller et al. 1987). This semi-quantitative but spatially distributed method is especially suited for regional investigations with limited data availability. The DRASTIC index is calculated based on seven components: Depth to groundwater, net recharge, Aquifer media, soil media, topography (slope), impact of vadose zone and hydraulic conductivity of the aquifer (Aller et al. 1987). Areas with unconfined aquifers or with shallow water tables receive a high index and, vice versa, area with fractured rock aquifers and deep water tables have a low index.\n\nFor the Pilbara region, based on the spatial distribution of index values, unconfined aquifer contamination due to a spill at the surface is considered not possible if the drastic index is less than 100. In grid cells with DRASTIC index between 100 and 125, unconfined aquifer contamination due to spill at the surface is considered possible but not material. In areas with DRASTIC indices above 125, unconfined aquifer contamination due to a spill at surface is considered material, so avoidance and mitigation strategies are considered.\n\nFurther information about the DRASTIC map and the development of this map is described in Holland et al. (2024) [Securing water for an emerging Australian hydrogen industry - Methods report].",

    "title": "Parent record: Vertical coherence of currents in Jervis Bay: Summer deployment of an Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler (ADCP)",
    "description": "This record describes components of the 'Jervis Bay Baseline Studies' project conducted by the Department of Defence, CSIRO and Australian Defence Force Academy (ADFA). The initial aims of the project were to obtain current and wind observations from Jervis bay over a six week period in order to detail the wind driven circulation and provide a data set for comparison with the numerical modelling work being simultaneously undertaken. However, after this initial experiment it became clear that there were significant currents in the bay that are not simply related to direct wind forcing. Therefore, alternative mechanisms for driving the flow had to be investigated, through the measurement programs and data analysis, as well as through numerical modelling. The result was a series of approximately six separate experiments aiming to define the water circulation around the bay and through the bay entrance, to gain an understanding of the processes that drive the currents, and to investigate the influence of stratification on the nature of the currents.\n\nThe fourth of these six experiments involved the  summer deployment of an Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler (ADCP), moored in the central part of Jervis Bay (35o 05'S, 150o 44'E). An ADCP measures how fast water is moving across an entire water column. Anchored to the seafloor it can measure current speed not just at the bottom, but also at equal intervals all the way up to the surface. For this experiment, the ADCP was moored on the seabed, in a frame, with sensors looking upwards and approximately 0.5m above the seabed. \n\nOver the summer deployment, 13th December 1990 to 15th January 1991, the ADCP was set-up with a 15 minute sampling interval and currents were measured over 1m depth bins. Bin numbers and currents are referenced as a height above the seabed (due to the uncertainty in defining water depth because of tides and air pressure). As such Bin #1 is centered at 1.5m above the transducer face or 2.0m above the seabed. Bin #2 is centered at 3m above the seabed, Bin #3 at 4m and so on.\n\nAs this is a parent record, no data is available to download. A pdf outlining the structure and hierarchy of metadata records relating to this project is available through this record. Also available is a pdf of a published working paper documenting this experiment and the results. There is only one subsiduary records that directly relates to this parent, through which the data is provided (see hierarchical tree):\n30d0a700-1fc2-11dd-a7e7-00188b4c0af8",

    "description": "\nThis polyline dataset shows the locations of Overhead and Underground Streetlight Cables in the Australian Capital Territory. \n\nThese assets are either owned or managed by City Services, Transport Canberra and City Services Directorate (TCCS). Assets managed and / or owned privately, by other ACT Government Directorates or by the Federal Government may not be included.\n\nThe streetlight cables are overhead or buried underground and carry the electrical load to power the streetlight network. There are different types of cables based on the load required to power each streetlight thus higher voltage cables are generally encased in a thicker conduit. The cables are connected to a circuit which is controlled at a controller box. The dataset includes streetlight cables from ActewAGL’s database as of June 30th 2017 in addition to new cables that have been handed over to the ACT Government since then. \n\nAttributes include location description, suburb, ownership, maintained by, asset sub type (Overhead Cable, Underground Cable), cable type and conduit, voltage (LOW or HIGH), the status of the cable (ABANDONED or IN SERVICE), when it was installed and the reference information for the source of the data. The cable length is based off the spatial geometry of each feature. \n\nThese assets are captured and maintained in the TCCS asset database through the works as executed (WAE) handover process or field audits. The information available in this dataset may be incomplete and should not be solely relied upon as a search. Cable locations / alignments generally represent indicative routes rather than being survey accurate. No warranty is given in relation to the data (including accuracy, reliability, completeness or suitability) and no liability accepted (including without limitation, liability in negligence) for any loss damage or costs (including consequential damage) relating to any use of the data. Minor to substantial delays may occur in updating the source data to reflect as-constructed information. This data is generally used for the Dial Before You Dig (DBYD) service and should be used as a guide only.\n\nFor additional information, please see the relevant municipal infrastructure standard (https://www.cityservices.act.gov.au/plan-and-build/standards-codes-and-guidelines/municipal-infrastructure-design-standards-mis).",

Fully immunised means a child has received the scheduled vaccinations according to age for hepatitis B (hepB); diphtheria, tetanus and whooping cough (DTPa); Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib); polio (IPV); pneumococcal, meningococcal C, measles, mumps and rubella (MMR), and varicella. The data spans the years of 2012-2017 and is aggregated to 2015 Department of Health Primary Health Network (PHN) areas, based on the 2011 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nThe data was sourced from the Australian Immunisation Register (AIR), which is administered by the Australian Government Department of Human Services. The AIR is a national register that records immunisations given to children to help parents and guardians keep track of their children’s immunisations.\nFor further information about this dataset, visit the data source: Australian Institute of Health and Welfare - Immunisation rates for children in 2016-17 Data Tables.\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data using the Department of Health - PHN Areas.\n\n\nThe AIR may underestimate coverage due to incomplete submission of immunisation records or the inclusion of children who no longer reside in an area but have not been updated on the register.\n\n\nValues assigned to \"NP\" in the original data have been removed from the data.\n\n\nRows assigned a \"#\" in the \"Interpret with Caution\" column should be interpreted with caution as these area’s eligible population is between 26 and 100 registered children.\n\n",

    "description": "The overall aims were to provide data on the distribution of deep seabed habitats and fauna that are amenable to scientific hypothesis testing, can be immediately applied to marine resource management processes, and that enable strategic development of tools and techniques for understanding the processes that maintain deep sea biodiversity. This work was to support the process of NWR Estate inventory and management performance assessment by providing interpreted benthic habitat maps, faunal inventories, distribution maps and conservation values. Data will be collected at scientific reference sites from potential MPA areas that can be re-visited for monitoring purposes in the future. Sampling along environmental gradients (geographic range and depth) in this section of Australia's coast will also provide the opportunity to evaluate biogeographic hypotheses. Further refinement of predictive methods for identifying seabed habitat types, initially developed in temperate and cool-temperate environments, will be enabled by data collection from this tropical location in Australia. We intended to highlight the importance of this underlying science as a modern \"Voyage of Discovery\" given the likely significance of the findings in terms of Australia's biodiversity and its biogeography and evolution. (From Voyage Plan).  Sediment samples were divided into two samples: an elutrition sample for macroinvertebrates that was sent to Robin Wilson at MV for analysis and a sediment sample to be analysed by Geoscience Australia.",

    "description": "Please Note: As announced by the Minister for Immigration and Border Protection on 25 June 2017, the Department of Immigration and Border Protection (DIBP) retired the paper-based Outgoing Passenger Cards (OPC) from 1 July 2017. The information previously gathered via paper-based outgoing passenger cards is now be collated from existing government data and will continue to be provided to users. Further information can be accessed here: http://www.minister.border.gov.au/peterdutton/Pages/removal-of-the-outgoing-passenger-card-jun17.aspx.\r\n\r\nDue to the retirement of the OPC, the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) undertook a review of the OAD data based on a new methodology. Further information on this revised methodology is available at: http://www.abs.gov.au/AUSSTATS/abs@.nsf/Previousproducts/3401.0Appendix2Jul%202017?opendocument&tabname=Notes&prodno=3401.0&issue=Jul%202017&num=&view= \r\n\r\nA sampling methodology has been applied to this dataset. This method means that data will not replicate, exactly, data released by the ABS, but the differences should be negligible.\r\n\r\nDue to ‘Return to Source’ limitations, data supplied to ABS from non-DIPB sources are also excluded.\r\n\r\nOverseas Arrivals and Departures (OAD) data refers to the arrival and departure of Australian residents or overseas visitors, through Australian airports and sea ports, which have been recorded on incoming or outgoing passenger cards. OAD data describes the number of movements of travellers rather than the number of travellers. That is, multiple movements of individual persons during a given reference period are all counted.\r\nOAD data will differ from data derived from other sources, such as Migration Program Outcomes, Settlement Database or Visa Grant information.\r\nTravellers granted a visa in one year may not arrive until the following year, or may not travel to Australia at all. Some visas permit multiple entries to Australia, so travellers may enter Australia more than once on a visa.\r\nSettler Arrivals includes New Zealand citizens and other non-program settlers not included on the Settlement Database. The Settlement Database includes onshore processed grants not included in Settler Arrivals.\r\n\r\nThese de-identified statistics are periodically checked for privacy and other compliance requirements. The statistics were temporarily removed in March 2024 in response to a question about privacy within the emerging technological environment. Following a thorough review and risk assessment, the Department of Home Affairs has republished the dataset.\r\n",

It builds upon previous studies, particularly the 2021 Floodplain Risk Management Study (FRMS), and integrates lessons from the catastrophic 2022 flood events.\n\nThe FRMS study area comprises the urban areas of North Lismore, South Lismore, Central Lismore, and East Lismore. \n\nThe objective of the Lismore Flood Risk Management Plan (FRMP) is to provide a short- to medium-term strategy for managing flood risk in the Lismore Township. Specifically, the plan aims to:\n\nEstablish a comprehensive program of works and measures to progressively reduce the social, environmental, and economic impacts of flooding, supported by a clear implementation and funding framework.\n\nRecommend updates to Council policies and planning instruments to ensure that future development on flood-affected land is compatible with identified flood hazards and risks.\n\nReview and improve existing flood management practices, including the operation of key hydraulic controls and natural floodplain features, to enhance flood mitigation outcomes.\n\nEnsure alignment with local emergency management planning, supporting effective flood response and evacuation strategies.\n\nSecure community support and engagement, ensuring that the FRMP reflects local values, experiences, and priorities in flood risk management.",

    "description": "The Stocky Galaxias (Galaxias tantangara Raadik 2014) is a newly described species with few museum specimens. The name ‘tantangara’ is taken from the small alpine stream from which the first specimens were collected, a tributary of the upper Murrumbidgee River draining from Mount Tantangara. The species is only known from one locality, the headwaters of Tantangara Creek, upstream of the Tantangara Reservoir, NSW. It is restricted to a small creek above a waterfall, approximately 4 km from the source. \nThe Stocky Galaxias is a small fish named after its distinctly stocky body. It is recorded to grow to 103mm long and 13g in weight, but is more commonly 75-85 mm long. The body is predominantly dark olivebrown on the back and upper sides above the lateral line, becoming lighter to cream ventrally. Individuals possess many dark brown to almost black spots and flecks that may vary in size, found along the body, head and snout. The fins are translucent dusky grey and the gill covers are translucent. It has a long anal fin, short nostrils and an upper jaw that is slightly longer than the lower jaw. \nThey are a critically endangered species -\nhttps://www.dpi.nsw.gov.au/fishing/species-protection/whatcurrent/critically/stocky-galaxias.\nAs this species only occurs in one locality, the 2018 NSW Hydroline was used for its indicative distribution.",

    "description": "Conservation of riverine and wetland vegetation diversity is a key objective of the Basin Plan, and was a core element investigated at the Basin-scale in the LTIM Project. \r\n\r\nThe CEWO’s LTIM Project examined the contribution of Commonwealth environmental water to the environmental objectives of the Basin Plan 2012 (Basin Plan) and assisted the CEWO to demonstrate environmental outcomes and adaptively manage the water holdings. Monitoring and evaluation was focused in seven Selected Areas: the Junction of the Warrego and Darling rivers, Gwydir river system, Lachlan river system, Murrumbidgee river system, Edward/Kolety-Wakool river system, Goulburn River and Lower Murray River. These areas will continue to be monitored through the CEWO’s Monitoring, Evaluation and Research (MER) Program.  \r\n\r\nData collected by monitoring at Selected Areas is used to evaluate local outcomes from watering and also contributed to the analysis and evaluation of Basin Plan objectives.\r\n\r\nVegetation diversity data was collected and used over the duration of the LTIM Project from 2014-15 to 2018-19 from four wetland Selected Areas (Gwydir, Lachlan, Murrumbidgee and junction of Warrego-Darling river systems) and two riverine Selected Areas (Edward/Kolety-Wakool and Goulburn river systems), considering plant species diversity and vegetation community diversity. \r\n\r\nData collected* includes the percent cover of plant species present within three vegetation strata (groundlayer, understorey and overstorey) and a range of environmental variables (e.g. soil moisture) at time of sampling. \r\n\r\n*Data collected from the Edward/Kolety-Wakool river system is limited to Category 3 and does not have the same taxonomic resolution or range of observations as that from other Selected Areas. \r\n\r\nPlease refer to the Murray-Darling Basin LTIM Project: 2018-19 Basin-scale evaluation of Commonwealth environmental water – Vegetation Diversity Report for the detailed method on data used for evaluation.  \r\n\r\n###Acknowledgement\r\n\r\nThe Commonwealth Environmental Water Office acknowledge the First Nations peoples as the Traditional Owners and Custodians of the lands, waterways and skies of the Murray-Darling Basin. We thank them for their knowledge and science and respect their continuing connection to culture and Country and the values reflected in these data.\r\n\r\n",

This project will produce maps and assess the impact of fire in of areas of greatest concern, including littoral rainforest and coastal vine thickets and riparian forest. We will assess the impacts of Tropical Cyclone Yasi on mahogany glider habitat, levels of rainforest invasion, and impacts of fire on new vegetation.",

    "description": "The association of FRB 200428 with the Galactic magnetar SGR 1935+2154 confirms that magnetars can power fast radio bursts (FRBs). However, FRB 200428 is 4 to 8 orders of magnitude less energetic than the typical population of cosmological FRBs. This discrepancy is likely due to the moderate magnetic field strength and evolved age of SGR 1935+2154. In contrast, newborn extragalactic magnetars, such as those formed in gamma-ray burst (GRB) central engines, are expected to have much stronger magnetic fields, more rapid spin-down, and highly dynamic magnetospheres, all of which favor the production of brighter and more frequent FRBs.\n\nWe propose a targeted search for FRBs from the recently localized GRB 230307A, a long-duration GRB with evidence suggesting the formation of a young magnetar. Given the source's relatively close distance (291 Mpc) and possible youth (less than 3 years), it offers a compelling opportunity to test FRB generation mechanisms during the early evolution of a magnetar.\n\nWe request 30 hours of observing time with the Parkes 64-m Murriyang telescope using the ultra-wideband low-frequency (UWL) receiver. Our plan includes one 10-hour long-duration session to detect rare or clustered bursts, and ten 2-hour sessions spread over 2-3 months to sample temporal variability. Data will be processed with state-of-the-art pipelines for single-pulse searches and coherent dedispersion.\n\nA detection would strongly support magnetar-origin FRB models and provide key constraints on the early-time activity of GRB-formed neutron stars.",

    "description": "This dataset is an output of the  Pilbara Marine Conservation Partnership (PMCP). Environmental Pessures Theme - Project Habitats and Biodiversity Characterisation and Mapping.  The benthic invertebrate, plant and fish biodiversity of the west Pilbara region was sampled between 10 and 27 June 2013 during voyages on the CSIRO vessel RV Linnaeus and WA Fisheries vessel RV Naturaliste. The equipment used was:\n0.75m epibenthic sled at 13 sites for a distance of ~300m or a\n1.5m epibenthic sled at 98 sites for a distance of ~150m per tow; \na Pipe dredge attached to each sled;\nan 8 Fathom Florida Flyer Trawl at 43 sites for a distance of ~1km per tow;\nand a Drop-Camera video system towed for a 500 m transect at 123 sites to observe and record video of the seabed habitat. Continuous underway coding during Drop-camera transects recorded cover of 9 substratum types, 25 biohabitat types, and occurrence of 14 faunal classes.\n\nThe results for the Sled and Trawl are presented as biomass per area swept by the gear (kg per ha).  \n\nDuring the Voyage Biota collected using the Sled and Trawl were sorted into 26 broad taxonomic categories from each tow (samples). These  were photographed, weighed, preserved and retained for identification.\nLarge biota such as turtles and seasnakes were measured, counted, weighed (or weight estimated), photographed and returned to the ocean alive.\nNon-living rocks/shells were photographed and weighed as a category called trash and returned to the ocean.\n\nThe following groups were retained and identified by taxonomists and voucher specimens curated at WA Museum:\nMarine Plants;\nSponges;\nCorals;\nCrustaceans;\nEchinoderms;\nMolluscs;\nand Fishes\n - many sponges were collected and require microscopic examination for identification - processing is expected to be complete mid 2016.\n\nThe following groups were retained with no facility for further identification as part of this project, and are currently at CSIRO Oceans and Atmosphere WA:\nAscidians - samples separated into colonial and solitary preserved in formalin;\nBrachiopoda - Frozen;\nBryozoa - Frozen;\nHydroids - Frozen;\nMiscellaneous - Frozen;\nWorms - Formalin.\n\nA pipe-dredge was attached to the sled to collect sediment samples: a 500 ml subsample was retained.\n\nThe Pilbara Marine Conservation Partnership (PMCP) was an initiative designed to enhance the net conservation benefits of the globally-significant coral reef ecosystems of the Pilbara (Western Australia) by providing an assessment of the condition and trajectory of key ecological values. These assessments were designed to inform and complement existing governance and management arrangements and the PMCP is intended to provide ongoing advice and assessment for conservation efforts in the region, providing lasting benefits.\nThe PMCP concept is based on three core ecological components, namely: \nCoral Reef Health - concentrating mainly on habitat forming primary producers.\nFish and Sharks - their community structure, interactions and impacts on lower trophic levels.\nEnvironmental Pressures - physical and anthropogenic factors that influence the condition of reefs",

    "description": "This dataset presents the footprint of the number of installations of small generation unit (SGU) wind systems and their rated output in kilowatts (kW). The data spans the months of 2002 and includes the total for the year. The data is aggregated to Postal Areas (POAs) from the 2016 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nEvery month the Clean Energy Regulator (CER) publishes small-scale renewable energy installation data files. These data files provide a list of SGU (small-scale solar panel, wind and hydro systems) and kW capacity by installed postcode, and solar water heaters (SWH) and air source heat pumps by installed postcode. The data represents all systems that have had certificates validly created against them. The data includes new installations, upgrades to existing systems and stand-alone (off-grid) systems. This data is not publicly available via the Renewable Energy Certificate (REC) Registry and does not include systems that are pending registration or have been failed by the CER.\nFor further information about this dataset, visit the data source:Clean Energy Regulator - Postcode Data for Small-scale Installations.\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data by joining the data with the 2016 ASGS POAs\n\n\nMonthly installation data is provided for months where an installation was registered.\n\n\nThe data is current as at 30-09-2018.\n\n\nRenewable Energy Target (RET) legislation allows a 12 month creation period for registered persons to create their certificates.\n\n\nSmall-scale technology certificates are calculated based on the life of the system. This differs for solar hot water heaters and small generation units (solar panels, wind and hydro). Further information can be found at theRenewable Energy Target FAQ.\n\n\nCapacity data has been revised to account for past data entry errors which caused significant inconsistencies. These systems were installed between 2001 and 2003. As a result of this revision, the cumulative installed capacity from 2004 onwards has reduced by 5.517MW.\n\n",

    "description": "This dataset presents the footprint of statistics related to the leading causes of death by sex. The reported statistics include cause of death, ranking, total deaths, crude rates, age-standardised rates and rate ratio. The data spans the period between 2012-2016 and is aggregated to 2017 Department of Health Primary Health Network (PHN) areas, based on the 2016 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nMortality Over Regions and Time (MORT) books are workbooks that contain recent deaths data for specific geographical areas, sourced from the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare (AIHW) National Mortality Database. They present various statistics related to deaths by all causes and leading causes of death by sex for each geographical area.\nFor further information about this dataset, visit the data source:Australian Institute of Health and Welfare - MORT Books.\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data using the Department of Health - PHN Areas.\n\n\nCause of Death Unit Record File data are provided to the AIHW by the Registries of Births, Deaths and Marriages and the National Coronial Information System (managed by the Victorian Department of Justice) and include cause of death coded by the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS). The data are maintained by the AIHW in the National Mortality Database.\n\n\nYear refers to the year of registration of death. Deaths registered in 2013 and earlier are based on the final version of the cause of death data; deaths registered in 2014 are based on revised version; deaths registered in 2015 and 2016 are based on preliminary versions. Revised and preliminary versions are subject to further revision by the ABS.\n\n\nCause of death information are based on the underlying cause of death and are classified according to the International Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD). Deaths registered in 1997 onwards are classified according to the 10th revision (ICD-10).\n\n\nUnknown/missing includes deaths where place of usual residence was overseas, no fixed abode, offshore and migratory, and undefined.\n\n\nPopulation counts are based on estimated resident populations at 30 June for each year. Australian estimated resident population data are sourced from Australian demographic statistics (ABS cat. no. 3101.0).\n\n",

    "description": "The Climate Vulnerability Assessment was designed to provide an overview of the impact of future climate change on all stages of production for the commodities and biosecurity risks assessed. The project used multicriteria analysis (MCA) models to produce assessments for the commodities and biosecurity risks in a consistent and comparable way, and a framework was developed to provide a rigorous, flexible and transparent process for assessing vulnerabilities and opportunities to climate change. Details of the approach and the climate data used in the assessments can be found in the Methodology Report (https://www.dpi.nsw.gov.au/dpi/climate/climate-vulnerability-assessment/publications-and-reports) which also details model exclusions and assumptions.\nAssessments were undertaken on commodities grouped into 6 nodes:\n    Horticulture and Viticulture, Broadacre Cropping, Forestry, Extensive Livestock, Marine Fisheries\nas well as on a set of biosecurity risks related to these primary industry sectors. The Summary Report (https://www.dpi.nsw.gov.au/dpi/climate/climate-vulnerability-assessment/publications-and-reports) gives details of the chosen commodities and biosecurity risks and summarises the high-level results.\nResults Reports for each commodity and biosecurity risk are being released. Visit the project's web page to access these reports and for further information: https://www.dpi.nsw.gov.au/dpi/climate/climate-vulnerability-assessment.\nThis dataset contains maps of modelled climate suitability for the forestry node of the DPIRD Climate Vulnerability Assessment; the only commodity in this node is Radiata pine. Maps are provided for each element of the model: the overall climate suitability, climate suitability maps for each phenophase and also for each phenophase/climate variable combination contained in the model. Data is provided for each of the eight global climate models used in the project, as well as the climate suitability derived from historical observations.",

The Future Reef MAP project is funded by Rio Tinto Alcan and administered by the Great Barrier Reef Foundation, with an equal co-investment by CSIRO. The project is the first large-scale CO2 observing system established on the Great Barrier Reef using the Rio Tinto ship, RTM Wakmatha. The research is targeted at providing information on the CO2 uptake and the controls on ocean acidification change in the region. It is providing foundation data needed to assess the vulnerability of the GBR reefs to ocean acidification. This dataset contains quality controlled underway measurements of the fugacity of CO2, atmospheric pressure, and sea surface temperature and salinity. The data management and distribution of these data were supported by the CSIRO Carbon Collaboration Cluster and the Australian Coastal Ecosystem Facility.",

Radioactive material was found in the area by Mr. L. Good, Box 273, Darwin, during October, and samples were sent to Rum Jungle for testing. A brief inspection of the area was made by the writer and Dr. N.H. Fisher on 7th November, 1952. It seems likely that the mineral causing radioactivity has been precipitated, probably by organic matter, from the spring water in the black clay layer, but the original source of the material is not at present clear.",

    "description": "The 2015-16 Budget is officially available at [budget.gov.au](http://www.data.gov.au) as the authoritative source of Budget Papers and Portfolio Budget Statement (PBS) documents. This dataset is a collection of data sources from the 2015-16 Budget, including:\r\n\r\n* The Portfolio Budget Statement Excel spreadsheets – Available after PBSs tabled in the Senate (~8.30pm Budget night).\r\n* A Machine Readable CSV of all PBS Excel Spreadsheet Line Items – Available after PBSs tabled in the Senate and translated (~8.30pm Budget night).\r\n\r\nData from the 2015-16 Budget are provided to assist those who wish to analyse, visualise and programmatically access the 2015-16 Budget. \r\n\r\nData users should refer to footnotes and memoranda in the original files as these are not usually captured in machine readable CSVs.\r\n\r\nWe welcome your feedback and comments below.\r\n\r\nThis dataset was prepared by the Department of Finance and the Department of the Treasury.\r\n\r\n##Information about the PBS Excel files and CSV##\r\n\r\nThe PBS Excel files published should include the following financial tables with headings and footnotes. Only the line item data (table 2.2) is available in CSV at this stage. Much of the other data is also available in the Budget Papers 1 and 4 in aggregate form:\r\n\r\n* Table 1.1: Entity Resource Statement;\r\n* Table 1.2: Entity 2015-16 Budget Measures;\r\n* Table 2.1: Budgeted Expenses for Outcome X;\r\n* Table 2.2: Programme Expenses and Programme Components.\r\n* Table 3.1.1: Movement of Administered Funds Between Years;\r\n* Table 3.1.2: Estimates of Special Account Flows and Balances;\r\n* Table 3.1.3: Australian Government Indigenous Expenditure (AGIE);\r\n* Tables 3.2.1 to 3.2.6: Departmental Budgeted Financial Statements; and\r\n* Tables 3.2.7 to 3.2.11: Administered Budgeted Financial Statements.\r\n\r\nPlease note, total expenses reported in the CSV file ‘2015-16 PBS line items dataset’ was prepared from individual entity programme expense tables. Totalling these figures does not produce the total expense figure in ‘Table1: Estimates of General Government Expenses’ (*Statement 6, Budget Paper 1*). \r\n\r\nDifferences relate to:\r\n\r\n1. Intra entity charging for services which are eliminated for the reporting of general government financial statements;\r\n2. Entity expenses that involve revaluation of assets and liabilities are reported as other economic flows in general government financial statements; and\r\n3. Additional entities’ expenses are included in general government sector expenses (e.g. Australian Strategic Policy Institute Limited and other entities) noting that only entities that are directly government funded are required to prepare a PBS.\r\n\r\nThe original PBS Excel files and published documents include sub-totals and totals by entity and appropriation type which are not included in the line item CSV. These can be calculated programmatically. Where modifications are identified they will be updated as required. \r\n\r\nIf a corrigendum to an entities PBS is issued after budget night, tables will be updated as necessary.\r\n\r\nThe structure of the line item CSV is;\r\n\r\n* Portfolio\r\n* Department/Entity\r\n* Outcome\r\n* Program\r\n* Expense type\r\n* Appropriation type\r\n* Description\r\n* 2014-15\r\n* 2015-16\r\n* 2016-17\r\n* 2017-18\r\n* 2018-19\r\n* Source document\r\n* Source table\r\n* URL\r\n\r\nThe data transformation is expected to be complete by midday 13 May.  We may put up an incomplete CSV which will continue to be updated as additional PBSs are transformed into data form.\r\n\r\nThe following Portfolios are included in the line item CSV: \r\n\r\n* Agriculture\r\n* Attorney General's\r\n* Communications\r\n* Defence\r\n* Education and Training \r\n* Employment\r\n* Environment\r\n* Finance\r\n* Foreign Affairs and Trade\r\n* Health\r\n* Human Services\r\n* Immigration and Border Protection\r\n* Industry and Science\r\n* Infrastructure and Regional Development\r\n* Parliamentary Departments\r\n* Prime Minister and Cabinet\r\n* Social Services\r\n* Treasury\r\n* Veterans' Affairs\r\n\r\n##Budget Paper Tables##\r\n\r\nWe have made a number of data tables from the Budget Papers available in Excel and CSV formats.\r\n\r\nBelow is the list of the tables published and whether we’ve translated them into CSV form this year:\r\n\r\n* Budget Paper 1: Appendix A1 - Estimates of expenses by function and sub‑function\r\n* Budget Paper 1: Overview - Appendix C Major Intiatives\r\n* Budget Paper 1: Overview - Appendix D Major Savings\r\n* Budget Paper 1: Statement 3 - Table 7: Reconciliation of underlying cash balance estimates\r\n* Budget Paper 1: Statement 4 - Table 1: Australian Government general government receipts\r\n* Budget Paper 1: Statement 4 - Table 7: Australian Government general government (cash) receipts\r\n* Budget Paper 1: Statement 4 - Table 10: Reconciliation of 2015‑16 general government (accrual) revenue\r\n* Budget Paper 1: Statement 4 - Supplementary table 3: Australian Government (accrual) revenue\r\n* Budget Paper 1: Statement 10 - Table 1: Australian Government general government sector receipts, payments, net Future Fund earnings and underlying cash balance\r\n* Budget Paper 1: Statement 10 - Table 4: Australian Government general government sector taxation receipts, non‑taxation receipts and total receipts\r\n* Budget Paper 1: Statement 10 - Table 5: Australian Government general government sector net debt and net interest payments\r\n* Budget Paper 4 Table 1.1 – Agency Resourcing\r\n* Budget Paper 4 Table 1.2 – Special Appropriations\r\n* Budget Paper 4 Table 1.3 – Special Accounts\r\n* Budget Paper 4 Table 2.2 – Staffing Tables\r\n* Budget Paper 4 Table 3.1 – Departmental Expenses\r\n* Budget Paper 4 Table 3.2 – Net Capital Investment\r\n\r\n###Change Log###\r\n1. *22:30PM 12/05/2015* dataset first published\r\n2. *09:00 13/05/2015* machine readable csv updated to include data from National Museum of Australia, Australian Aged Care Quality Agency & Australian Institute of Family Studies.\r\n3. *15:30 13/05/2015* machine readable csv updated to include a column linking to resource file and fixed a few minor errors.\r\n4. *16:00 14/05/2015* have added several selected transformed tables from Budget Paper 4.\r\n5. *12:30 18/05/2015* several minor updates to CSV.\r\n6. *16:00 03/06/2015* added several machine readable Budget Paper 1 tables prepared by Department of the Treasury.",

    "description": "The Climate Vulnerability Assessment was designed to provide an overview of the impact of future climate change on all stages of production for the commodities and biosecurity risks assessed. The project used multicriteria analysis (MCA) models to produce assessments for the commodities and biosecurity risks in a consistent and comparable way, and a framework was developed to provide a rigorous, flexible and transparent process for assessing vulnerabilities and opportunities to climate change. Details of the approach and the climate data used in the assessments can be found in the Methodology Report which also details model exclusions and assumptions.\nAssessments were undertaken on commodities grouped into 6 nodes: Horticulture and Viticulture, Broadacre Cropping, Forestry, Extensive Livestock, Marine Fisheries, as well as for a set of biosecurity risks related to these primary industry sectors. The Summary Report gives details of the chosen commodities and biosecurity risks and summarises the high-level results.\nResults Reports for each commodity and biosecurity risk are being released. Visit the project's web pages to access these reports and for further information.\nThis dataset contains maps of modelled climate suitability for the citrus model in the Horticulture and Viticulture node of the DPIRD Climate Vulnerability Assessment. Maps are provided (in GeoTIFF format) for each element of the model: the overall climate suitability, climate suitability maps for each phenophase and also for each phenophase/climate variable combination in the model. Data is provided for each of the eight global climate models (GCMs) used in the project, as well as the climate suitability derived from historical observations, along with the ensemble median for each map.",

    "description": "This series comprises hydrographic charts held at Queensland State Archives were prepared by the Harbours and Rivers Department and its successors, as well as the British Admiralty, Royal Navy, Royal Australian Navy and the Australian Hydrographic Service. Initially, hydrographic charts of the [Queensland] coast were published by the British Admiralty, surveys having been undertaken by the Royal Navy. Australia's hydrographic service was subsequently formed on 1 October 1920 as a part of the Royal Australian Navy. The earliest items in this series dating from Flinders' 1802 Chart of Terra Australis, comprise copies of the Admiralty or Royal Navy charts.\nDetails recorded on hydrographic charts include regular water depth, positions and least depth over all shoals, wrecks, reefs, banks, etc, position of the coastline (HW and LW mark), nature of the bottom, leading lines fixed and sounded, tidal stream measurements and observations, navigation marks, lights and sailing directions, details of wrecks, etc.\nWhile the series provides an historical survey record of the Queensland coast and major rivers and bays, it includes charts current to year 2010, both new charts and resurveys or updates.\nIn addition to coastal hydrographic charts and charts of bay entrance channels and reach surveys for navigation purposes, the series includes hydrographic survey plans recording improvements or works in progress, for example, dredging, test bores, reclamation, siltation, wharfage or marina proposals. Some land drawings are also included, for example, port land use and facilities.\nThe charts are loose and while the majority are within A1/B1 size, they vary from small foolscap drawings up to 2A0 dimensions. Original drawings are linen, tracing paper or tracing film while copies are generally photo-sensitive film.",

    "description": "This dataset is a component of the 'Jervis Bay Baseline Studies' project conducted by the Department of Defence, CSIRO and the Australian Defence Force Academy.\n\nThe meteorological station (35.133S, 150.762E) recorded winds and atmospheric pressure at Governor Head (Jervis Bay). The site is several hundred metres inland of 50m high cliffs and is 63m above sea-level.\n\nThis record provides wind statistics for June 1989. Five datasets are included here representing different times of the day: 0000-0550, 0600-1150, 1200-1750 and 1800-2350. Individual measurements have been converted so that trends of wind speed and direction can be seen for the time period in question. The fifth dataset incorporates all the wind data collected irrespective of time providing a monthly summary. The station initially recorded wind data at 10 minute intervals.\n\nThis is one of thirty-six child records that relate to the parent, 629051e0-2b7b-11dd-a343-00188b4c0af8. A pdf outlining the structure and hierarchy of all metadata records relating to the 'Jervis Bay Baseline Studies' project is available to download through this record. Meteorological data was collected to investigate wind forced circulation in Jervis Bay, NSW.",

This is the traditional approach used for CARRS assessment in Australia and has been applied at the State scale (and is also applied nationally).\n\nThe outcome approach considers how irreplaceable each patch of habitat is, based on its contribution to the conservation of species (using vascular plants and vertebrates). All areas critical to the long-term conservation of one or more species of conservation concern are used to assess sufficiency and to set priorities for future protection and conservation. Due to data paucity, the current assessment was only able to encompass the agricultural zone of South Australia. Work has commenced that will enable the Statewide application of this approach, which will be captured in future updates.\n\nThis tabular output is designed to be joined to the LANDSCAPE.IbraSubregionAust70 spatial layer.",

    "description": "The Acidification Moorings sub-facility is responsible for building an ocean carbon and acidification monitoring network for Australian waters. These moorings provide key observations to help us understand and address the problem of increasing ocean acidification. Each mooring is equipped with surface CO2 systems, using proven and robust technology. Three sensors will determine surface CO2, temperature and salinity. The hydrochemistry sampling at the National Reference Stations will also provide total alkalinity data, as will future pH sensors on the moorings, allowing for a complete determination of the carbonate system and pH. \n\nAcidification moorings are co-located at three National Reference Stations: * the Yongala NRS in Queensland (replaced in September 2013 after Tropical Cyclone Yasi, and then decommissioned in August 2014), * the Maria Island NRS in Tasmania, and * the Kangaroo Island NRS in South Australia. There is also one site located adjacent to the Heron Island reef slope in the Wistari channel on the Great Barrier Reef. The Yongala, Wistari and Maria Island acidification moorings are located to characterise changes down the east coast of Australia and the influence of the East Australian Current on CO2 uptake and acidification from the Great Barrier Reef to the Southern Ocean. The Kangaroo Island mooring monitors the deeper waters upwelled on the South Australian shelf which are expected to have higher CO2 and thus could accelerate the exposure of ecosystems to acidification earlier than in other regions.",

Footnotes have also been included as published in the files to assist in interpreting the data.\r\n\r\n- - - - - -\r\n\r\n_9 February 2016:_ Files for the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, Australian Securities and Investments Commission, and the Australian Taxation Office have now been uploaded.\r\n\r\n_9 March 2016:_ Program expense tables have been uploaded in machine readable format.",

    "description": "Fish larvae counts from light traps and drift nets collected as part of the Commonwealth Environmental Water Office's (CEWO) Flow-MER program in the Murray-Darling Basin.\r\n\r\nSpawning of both native and introduced species was measured by collecting eggs and fish larvae using drift nets and light traps during the known spawning period at five Selected Areas (Edward/Kolety–Wakool River System, Goulburn River, Lachlan River System, Lower Murray River, Murrumbidgee River).\r\n\r\nBongo tow nets, rather than drift nets, were used to sample pelagic fish in the Lower Murray River due to very slow flow velocities.\r\n\r\nThe CEWO’s Flow-MER program examines the contribution of Commonwealth environmental water to the environmental objectives of the Basin Plan 2012 (Basin Plan) and is assisting the CEWO to demonstrate environmental outcomes and adaptively manage the water holdings. For more information and reporting using these data see https://www.dcceew.gov.au/water/cewo/monitoring/mer-program.\r\n\r\nThis Flow-MER data set includes and extends the long-term data collected at the same sites during the Long Term Intervention Monitoring (LTIM) project (2014-2019).\r\n\r\n###Acknowledgement\r\n\r\nThe Commonwealth Environmental Water Office and Flow-MER program acknowledge the First Nations peoples as the Traditional Owners and Custodians of the lands, waterways and skies of the Murray-Darling Basin. We respect their continuing connection to culture and Country, and we thank them for their knowledge and science and the values reflected in these data.\r\n\r\n###Citation\r\n\r\nCEWO (2024) Fish Fish Larvae.

    "description": "The Climate Vulnerability Assessment was designed to provide an overview of the impact of future climate change on all stages of production for the commodities and biosecurity risks assessed. The project used multicriteria analysis (MCA) models to produce assessments for the commodities and biosecurity risks in a consistent and comparable way, and a framework was developed to provide a rigorous, flexible and transparent process for assessing vulnerabilities and opportunities to climate change. Details of the approach and the climate data used in the assessments can be found in the Methodology Report which also details model exclusions and assumptions.\nAssessments were undertaken on commodities grouped into 6 nodes: Horticulture and Viticulture, Broadacre Cropping, Forestry, Extensive Livestock, Marine Fisheries, as well as for a set of biosecurity risks related to these primary industry sectors. The Summary Report gives details of the chosen commodities and biosecurity risks and summarises the high-level results.\nResults Reports for each commodity and biosecurity risk are being released. Visit the project's web pages to access these reports and for further information.\nThis dataset contains maps of modelled climate suitability for the Dolphinfish model in the Marine Fisheries node of the DPIRD Climate Vulnerability Assessment. Maps are provided (in GeoTIFF format) for each element of the model: the climate suitability for each month, climate suitability maps for each phenophase and also for each phenophase/climate variable combination in the model. Data is provided for each of the eight global climate models (GCMs) used in the project, as well as the climate suitability derived from historical observations, along with the ensemble median for each map.\nMaps are provided (in GeoTIFF format) for each element of the model: the climate suitability for each season, climate suitability maps for each phenophase and also for each phenophase/climate variable combination in the model.

    "description": "The key objective of this Flood Study is to develop a suitable hydrologic/hydraulic model that\ncan project flood and permanent inundation water levels in Lake Macquarie from rainfall, sea\nlevel rise and storm surge. These results will be used by Lake Macquarie City Council, in\nconsultation with the community of Lake Macquarie City, to manage flood and permanent\ninundation risks to low lying land around the Lake Macquarie waterway.\nThe key stages in the process are:\nUndertaken a comprehensive review of the 1998 Lake Macquarie Flood Study (Part 1 –\nReference 1) and develop suitable hydrologic/hydraulic models to define flood behaviour\nover the full range of design events for existing catchment conditions,\nUse the hydrologic/hydraulic models to assess various climate change scenarios,\nincluding application of the NSW Government’s sea level rise benchmarks,\nAssess the potential increase in storm surge as a result of climate change and its impact\non elevated ocean levels,\nReview the potential impact of climate change on the local wind/wave climate as this\naffects the extent of wave runup on the foreshore,\nAssess the hydraulic and hazard categories for existing and climate change conditions.\nThis report details the results and findings of the above investigations. The key elements\ninclude:\na summary of available historical flood related data,\nestablishment of the hydrologic and hydraulic models,\ncalibration of the hydrologic and hydraulic models,\ndefinition of the design flood behaviour for existing catchment conditions,\nsensitivity analysis of the design flood behaviour,\nassessment of the impacts of climate change on the still water and wave runup water\nlevels\nre-definition of the flood extent and hydraulic and hazard categories mapping for existing\nand climate change conditions.\nA Flood Study is a technical document and not easily understood by the general public. A\nglossary of flood related terms is provided in Appendix A to assist. If more explanation of terms\nor a better understanding of the approach is required, type “NSW Government Floodplain\nDevelopment Manual” into an internet search engine and you will be directed to the NSW\nGovernment web site which provides a copy of this manual and further explanation.\nFlood levels given in this report relate only to the water level with the lake itself. Design water\nlevels in the creek systems entering the lake (Cockle Creek, Dora Creek etc.) will be higher than\nthose shown for the lake.",

    "description": "This dataset presents counts of payment recipients by payment type for the quarter ending September 2019. The data is based on the recipient's geocoded address aggregated by Local Government Area (LGA) from the Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS) 2018.\nThe Department of Social Services (DSS) is the Australian Government's lead agency in the development and delivery of social policy, and is working to improve the lifetime wellbeing of people and families in Australia. DSS' policies and services respond to need across people's lives - looking after families, children and older people; providing a safety net for people who cannot fully support themselves; enhancing the wellbeing of people with high needs; assisting people who need help with care; and supporting a diverse and harmonious society. DSS supports people and families in Australia by encouraging independence and participation, and supporting a cohesive society.\nFor more information on this dataset please visit the Australian Government Open Data.\nFor further details on payments, see 'A guide to Australian Government payments'.\nPlease note:\n\n\nIn order to protect individuals' privacy, identified populations between 1 and 4 have been suppressed and replaced with '&lt;5' for confidentiality purposes. Additional data may be suppressed and replaced with 'n.p.' (not provided) to prevent the derivation of identified populations that have values of less than 5.\n\n\nIndividuals who live overseas, individuals who are without a valid home address and individuals who only have a postal address cannot be assigned to a locational boundary. State/territory totals derived from Local Government Area data will not match actual state and territory totals, due to different statistical geography methodologies.\n\n\nCaveats specific to payments type can be found in the relevant payment description of the original data.\n\n\nAURIN has spatialised this dataset and have made the following replacements to enforce data type consistency: \n\n\n'&lt;5' has been assigned a value of '-1' within the data\n\n\nA boolean field has been created for each data field to flag left-censored data. 'True' is assigned to fields that have been censored.\n\n\n'n.p.' (not provided) has been set to Null within the data.\n\n",

Each data row has two concentrations: one for grass (Poaceae) and one for all other pollen. For comparison with other data sets and between pollen seasons the data weeks start at July 1 each calendar year. Extra days at the end of the pollen year are included in week 52. Each data row has a collection period start date, the number of days within the collection period (7-9), and the number of days on which pollen was collected and summed (0-9). Concentrations represent only the number of days collected and not always the full collection period, as indicated.  \nAirborne pollen samples were collected using a volumetric continuous flow impaction sampler (Burkard Manufacturing, UK), stained with fuchsin and counted by light microscopy according to best practice described in the Australian Airborne Pollen and Spore Monitoring Network Interim Standard and Protocols (Version 2, 14 September 2018).\nData may be used for modelling and forecasting airborne grass, other, total pollen levels. Other uses include analysis of the effect of pollen levels on asthma and allergy presentations, or in inference of grass and other vegetation growth patterns. Data may also be used for evaluation of medium or long-term trends over time or comparison withpollen exposure levels between spatial distant locations.\nMetadata about this and other AusPollen Aerobiology Collaboration Network monitoring sites is provided on the National Environmental Monitoring Site Register. Information about other pollen and spores monitored can be found by the AusPollen Aerobiology Collaboration Network Species Classification on the ARDC Research Vocabularies site.\nAURIN has added latitude, longitude and spatialised geometry columns for each row based on the coordinates of the pollen samples. Periods over which no data is available are marked as null.",

    "description": "The digital State Boundaries and their legal identifiers have been derived from the cadastre data from each state and territory jurisdiction and are available below.\r\n\r\nState Boundaries are part of Geoscape Administrative Boundaries, which is built and maintained by  [Geoscape Australia](https://geoscape.com.au/) using authoritative government data. Further information about contributors to Administrative Boundaries is available [here](https://geoscape.com.au/legal/data-copyright-and-disclaimer/).\r\n\r\nThe full Administrative Boundaries dataset contains boundaries in seven themes: Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) boundaries, electoral boundaries, state and territory boundaries, local government areas, suburbs/localities, wards and town points.\r\n\r\nAs at November 2019, users have the option to download datasets with feature coordinates referencing the new Geocentric Datum of Australia 2020 (GDA2020) in addition to datasets on the GDA94 datum.\r\n\r\nFor GDA2020 datasets, the name of the zip folder and the root folder (once extracted) include a reference to GDA2020. For GDA94 datasets, the zip and root folder names do not contain the datum name (i.e. they remain the same as previous releases).\r\n\r\nFor example, the zip and root folder for Administrative Boundaries downloaded in GDA2020 for November 2019 looks like this:\r\n\r\n       •\tNOV19_AdminBounds_ESRIShapefileorDBFfile_GDA2020; or \r\n       •\tNOV19_AdminBounds_MapInfoTABFormat_GDA2020\r\n\r\nThe zip and root folder for Administrative Boundaries in GDA94 for November 2019 looks like this: \r\n\r\n       •\tNOV19_AdminBounds_ESRIShapefileorDBFfile; or \r\n       •\tNOV19_AdminBounds_MapInfoTABFormat\r\n\r\nIrrespective of the datum chosen, files within the respective folder use exactly the same naming structures.\r\n\r\nFurther information on Administrative Boundaries, including FAQs on the data, is available [here](https://geoscape.com.au/data/administrative-boundaries/) through Geoscape Australia’s network of [partners](https://geoscape.com.au/partners/). They provide a range of commercial products based on Administrative Boundaries, including software solutions, consultancy and support.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## License Information\r\n\r\nThe Australian Government has negotiated the release of Administrative Boundaries to the whole economy under an [open CCBY 4.0 license](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).\r\n\r\nUsers must only use the data in ways that are consistent with the Australian Privacy Principles issued under the Privacy Act 1988 (Cth).\r\n\r\n**Users must also note the following attribution requirements:**\r\n\r\n_Preferred attribution for the Licensed Material:_\r\n\r\n> _Administrative Boundaries © [Geoscape Australia](https://geoscape.com.au/legal/data-copyright-and-disclaimer/) licensed by the Commonwealth of Australia under_ [_Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International licence (CC BY 4.0)_](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).\r\n\r\n_Preferred attribution for Adapted Material:_\r\n\r\n> _Incorporates or developed using Administrative Boundaries © [Geoscape Australia](https://geoscape.com.au/legal/data-copyright-and-disclaimer/) licensed by the Commonwealth of Australia under_ [_Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International licence (CC BY 4.0)_](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).",

    "description": "This dataset is a component of the 'Jervis Bay Baseline Studies' project conducted by the Department of Defence, CSIRO and the Australian Defence Force Academy.\n\nThe meteorological station at Governor Head (35.133S, 150.762E) and the anemometer in Huskisson (35.0416S, 150.67E) recorded winds between 10th August 1990 and 12th September 1990. The site at Governor head is several hundred metres inland of 50m high cliffs and is 63m above sea-level. The anemometer readings from Huskisson was run by the NSW Public Works Department.\n\nThis is one of thirty-six child records that relate to the parent, 629051e0-2b7b-11dd-a343-00188b4c0af8. A pdf outlining the structure and hierarchy of all metadata records relating to the 'Jervis Bay Baseline Studies' project is available to download through this record. Meteorological data was collected to investigate wind forced circulation in Jervis Bay, NSW.",

    "description": "This dataset describes habitat suitability for feral pig breeding and persistence in northern Australia during the dry season. It is the result of a spatially-explicit, resource-based and regional-scale habitat model that integrated expert knowledge on feral pig breeding requirements and home range movements as well as seasonal variability in environmental conditions.\r\n\r\nThe modelled habitat suitability index (HSI) can theoretically range between 0 and 100, with higher values indicating better habitat quality for feral pig breeding. Due to modelling methods and assumptions, HSI values in this dataset effectively range between 11 and 81. They can be broadly classified as follows: HSI ≥ 60 = highly suitable habitat; HSI ≥ 40 = moderately suitable habitat; HSI < 40 = unsuitable habitat.\r\n\r\nPredicted habitat suitability should not be confused with actual feral pig occurrence. Individuals may be sighted at any time in unsuitable breeding habitat. Conversely, suitable breeding habitat may remain unoccupied. While there is a link between habitat suitability and population density, this may not always be straightforward (i.e. comparable habitat may carry vastly different actual or potential densities depending on the nature and quality of available resources).\r\n\r\nFeral pig habitat suitability in northern Australia was modelled for two seasonal scenarios. The dry season scenario captured unfavourable conditions during the late dry season, when resources required by feral pigs are generally scarce and scattered across the region. It was developed using spatial proxies averaged across two months (October/November) over five years (2010 to 2014). Seasonal model results were validated against four independent distributional data sets.\r\n\r\nUnderlying model parameters were elicited from experts. This dataset represents results from an expert-averaged model run. The model contained a variable \"Disturbance stress\" for which no spatial proxies were available. In this dataset, we assumed a uniformly “high” intensity and frequency of control activities, which likely overestimated disturbance and may undervalue habitat suitability in situations where there is actually little management.\r\n\r\nA detailed description of modelling methods and assumptions is provided in Froese et al. 2017 (https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0177018).",

    "title": "Climate Vulnerability Assessment: Blueberry",
    "description": "The Climate Vulnerability Assessment was designed to provide an overview of the impact of future climate change on all stages of production for the commodities and biosecurity risks assessed. The project used multicriteria analysis (MCA) models to produce assessments for the commodities and biosecurity risks in a consistent and comparable way, and a framework was developed to provide a rigorous, flexible and transparent process for assessing vulnerabilities and opportunities to climate change. Details of the approach and the climate data used in the assessments can be found in the Methodology Report which also details model exclusions and assumptions.\nAssessments were undertaken on commodities grouped into 6 nodes: Horticulture and Viticulture, Broadacre Cropping, Forestry, Extensive Livestock, Marine Fisheries, as well as for a set of biosecurity risks related to these primary industry sectors. The Summary Report gives details of the chosen commodities and biosecurity risks and summarises the high-level results.\nResults Reports for each commodity and biosecurity risk are being released. Visit the project's web pages to access these reports and for further information.\nThis dataset contains maps of modelled climate suitability for the blueberry model in the Horticulture and Viticulture node of the DPIRD Climate Vulnerability Assessment. Maps are provided (in GeoTIFF format) for each element of the model: the overall climate suitability, climate suitability maps for each phenophase and also for each phenophase/climate variable combination in the model. Data is provided for each of the eight global climate models (GCMs) used in the project, as well as the climate suitability derived from historical observations, along with the ensemble median for each map.",

    "description": "This is the historical contract notice (CN) data reported by Australian Government\r\nagencies for the years 1999 to 2020. The CN data has been sourced from\r\nthe Gazette Publishing System (GaPS) for the years 1999 to 2006-07, inclusive,\r\nand from the AusTender from 1 July 2007 onwards.\r\n\r\nEffective 1 July 2007, mandatory contract reporting was transferred to\r\nAusTender [www.tenders.gov.au](http://www.tenders.gov.au/) . Notices of\r\ncontracts that were active at 1 July 2007 were migrated to AusTender and will\r\ntherefore appear in both databases. These records are identifiable on\r\nAusTender by the GaPS ID reference. The reporting requirements for GaPS differed from those for AusTender reporting in terms of value thresholds, industry sector codes and contract confidentiality. For further information please contact the AusTender Help Desk at [tenders@finance.gov.au](mailto:tenders@finance.gov.au).\r\n\r\nThe CN data reflects contractual information reported by entities in accordance with entities' procurement publishing obligations. Please note that the data contained within each file was correct at the time of extraction. Data may change over time as agencies undertake data quality assurance processes or as contract information is varied. The contract values on AusTender represent the total maximum value of each contract over its life, including where contracts span multiple years. AusTender data does not reflect annual expenditure. \r\nThere is a Data Dictionary available for AusTender Contract Notice information which provides a full list of all the Contract Notice dataset field names and explains the data type, whether it is mandatory, and contains a description to provide further context for the data.\r\n\r\nNew contracts and contract amendments published within the last eighteen (18) months can be found by perusing the weekly [AusTender Contract Notice Export\r\nfiles](http://data.gov.au/dataset/austender-contract-notice-export/).\r\n\r\nContracts reported on AusTender are categorised under the United Nations Standard Products and Services Code (UNSPSC) which is reviewed and updated periodically. The UNSPSC is selected by an entity when reporting a contract to reflect the primary purpose of the contract. Below is a list of goods and services category codes used by Australian Government agencies to code their open approaches to market and contracts awarded for publication on AusTender. Code numbers starting with the prefixes **43 a Information Technology, Broadcasting and Telecommunications** and **81 a Engineering and Research and Technology Based Services** apply in the main to Information and Communications Technology related contracts, primarily ICT goods and services respectively.\r\n\r\nAusTender Contract Notice data is also available as an Application Programming Interface (API) which provides CN data in the [Open Contracting Data Standard](http://standard.open-contracting.org/) (OCDS) schema.\r\n\r\n",

The environmental sensors, measuring light levels, humidity and temperature, have been deployed at Fitzroy Gardens and Library at the Dock. The data collected will assist the Urban Landscapes branch to better understand and communicate the impact of canopy cover for urban cooling.",

The Buildings dataset has relationships with the G-NAF, Cadastre, Property and Administrative Boundaries products produced by Geoscape Australia. Users should note that these related Geoscape products are not part of Buildings.\nFor more information regarding Geoscape Buildings, please refer to the Data Product Description and the June 2022 Release Notes.\nPlease note: As per the licence for this data, the coverage area accessed by you can not be greater than a single Level 2 Statistical Area (SA2) as defined by the Australian Bureau of Statistics. If you require additional data beyond a single SA2 for your research, please request a quote from AURIN.\nBuildings is a digital dataset representing buildings across Australia. Data quality and potential capture timelines will vary across Australia based on two categories, each category has been developed based on a number of factors including the probability of the occurrence of natural events (e.g. flooding), population distribution and industrial/commercial activities. Areas with a population greater than 200, or with significant industrial/commercial activity in a visual assessment have been defined as 'Urban' and all other regions have been defined as 'Rural'. This dataset has been restricted to the Melbourne SA2 by AURIN.",

    "description": "Site NTB-5 is sampled monthly by Nyrstar Hobart as part of the  Derwent Ambient Water Quality monitoring program.\nSince 2003, ambient water quality monitoring has been carried out on a monthly basis at up to 28 sites throughout the Derwent estuary by Norske Skog Boyer, Nyrstar Hobart and the State Government. Monitoring is carried out by three different boat-based sampling parties, but is co-ordinated to occur on the same day each month. \nAt each site, in-situ field measurements are taken using calibrated sensors for temperature, salinity, pH, dissolved oxygen and turbidity. Water clarity is also measured using a secchi disk. Surface and bottom water samples are collected for analysis of true color, total suspended solids(TSS), total  and dissolved nutrients, organic carbon and zinc. at most sites, depth integrated samples are also collected for chlorophyll a using a plastic tube. Bottom samples in the Middle and Outer estuary are collected using a niskin bottle. Pumps are used in the upper estuary site to fill up the bottles. All water samples are analysed at Analytical Service Tasmania, a National Association of Testing Authorities-accredited laboratory. Monitoring site depth is 2 meters",
