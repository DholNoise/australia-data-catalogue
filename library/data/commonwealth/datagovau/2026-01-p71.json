    "description": "This data was collected in September 2009 by the IMOS Ship of Opportunity Underway CO2 Measurement research group on RV Southern Surveyor (IMOS platform code: VLHJ) voyage SS042009.\n\nDeparted: \tHobart, Tasmania, September 22, 2009\nArrived:  \tHobart, Tasmania, September 30, 2009\n\nCO2 System Overview:\nThe fugacity of carbon dioxide (fCO2) in surface seawater was measured using a General Oceanics Inc. automated system (Model 8050; Pierrot et al 2009). Seawater is sprayed into an equilibration chamber and CO2 in the headspace gas equilibrates with the seawater. The headspace gas is pumped through a thermoelectric condenser followed by a nafion drying tube before flowing through a Licor 7000 non-dispersive infrared gas analyser used to measure the CO2 mole fraction (XCO2) of the dried air. The gas flow is stopped temporarily for the CO2 measurements, which are made at atmospheric pressure. A set of four CO2 standards that cover the range of CO2 values expected in the ocean are analysed about every four hours to calibrate the gas analyser. The standard gas concentrations are on the WMO-X2007 mole fraction scale for CO2-in-air. Atmospheric XCO2 (dry) is measured after the standards by pumping clean outside air from an intake on the forward mast of the ship. \n\nSeawater intake and ancillary data:\nThe seawater intake is located at about 5.5m depth in the bow of the ship. Sea surface salinity is measured using a thermosalinograph (Seabird Electronics SBE21) located next to the CO2 system. A remote temperature sensor (Seabird Electronics SBE 38) located at the intake is used to measure sea surface temperature (SST). The travel time between the intake and CO2 system is typically about 4 minutes with warming usually less than 0.6ºC. The thermosalinograph water is from the same intake, but the supply lines separate after the intake. A comparison of thermosalinograph and equilibrator temperature records shows the temperature difference in the two lines is generally less than 0.1ºC. The thermosalinograph water line travels outside the ship and is typically warmer than the equilibrator. The travel time in water line to the thermosalinograph is 2.5 minutes faster than to the equilibrator. \n\nMeteorological data, salinity, SST, and ships position and time are taken from the ships logging system. These parameters and the data quality are maintained by the Australian Marine National Facility.",

    "description": "\n\n\nACT Climate refugia are core areas of the landscape most likely to support persistence of dominant trees, shrubs and grasses of the Capital Region under climate change.\nThe data identify refugia expected to support climate sensitive species characteristic of each vegetation community, both now and into the future, based on distribution modelling using NARCLiM climate projections (MacKenzie et al 2019).\nThe areas shown (refugia) highlight where the most stressed subset of dominant plant species today (i.e., common trees, shrubs and grasses modelled to lose &gt;= 75% of their current distribution) are more likely to persist under a wide range of future climate scenarios. These refugia can be used to prioritise management actions to minimise further stresses to those communities (e.g. prescribed burning within tolerable fire intervals; climate-adaptive revegetation programs, etc). Note: Areas smaller than 0.5 hectares have been removed to enable quicker map drawing, contact officeofnatureconservation@act.gov.au for the full dataset, including ensemble forecasts for individual plant species (n=151).\nSource Technical Report:\nMacKenzie, J.B., G.

    "description": "Raster layer delineates the level of uncertainty depending on the data scale.\nGeneral Background: The National Vegetation Information System (NVIS) has been developed over the last 15 years from a variety of data sources. The commonwealth is reliant on states and territories to supply vegetation data, which is then collated into the NVIS. Because of varying levels of resources available to different regions, the data they are able to supply is of varying scale, age, origin and spatial mix. \nNVIS is widely used by various organisation including, researchers, NGO and governments, for a wide range of uses such as modelling, fire fuel loads and policy. To improve the interpretation of the NVIS dataset the Dept of the Environment & Energy has developed a suite of uncertainty layers and tools to facilitate the robust use of the NVIS.\nAim: to develop a raster Uncertainty layer that is intended to better describe the input datasets and assist in dynamic analyses of data quality and gaps in the NVIS extant theme dataset.\nOutput: raster files scaled 0-1 that can be used for uncertainty, including data age, origin, scale and spatial mix. The layers can be added together to form one uncertainty layer. Python script/tools will also be provided so individuals can develop their own uncertainty layers and to be as transparent as possible.\nThe Uncertainty layers comprise 5 rasters, 1 composite and 5 individual layers:\n                 -      NVIS Uncertainty layer (composite of 4 below layers)\n                 -      Age: age of the NVIS data\n                 -      Origin: where the data came from\n                 -      Spatial mix: if the data is a mosaic\n                 -      Scale: scale that the data was mapped\nAge, scale, origin and spatial mix Information is supplied by the states and territories as part of the NVIS resupply process.\nThis dataset represents a scale of uncertainty in relation to data scale. Scale categories are below.\nTable 1.

    "description": "This data set spatially depicts shoreline types useful for responding to an oil spill in Tasmanian State coastal waters as specified by the Oil Spill Response Atlas project.  The data consists of a landform map of the coastline from Sandy Cape clockwise to Port Davey. The coastline has been mapped from current and earlier (1978) airphoto interpretation, current topographic and geological maps, and limited ground truthing.  The landform map comprises a single line mapped into segments at 1:25,000 scale and tagged with a descriptive characterisation of the intertidal shoreline landforms in each segment (s_type), and a characterisation of the major geomorphic controls on coastal landform development in each segment (reg_code).  The coastal landform types (s_types) have been coded as NOAA codes as per the AMSA Data Dictionary Appendix 2 and have been attributed according to likely oiling persistence and trafficability.The data have been presented in a format which will be compatible with numerous other coastal management and research applications.  A data dictionary accompanying the data set gives a detailed explanation. The basic data set was compiled by Chris Sharples and Richard Mount, DPIWE Jul - Nov 1999. The base data is currently held in AGD66 geographicals (ie Latitude Longitude).",

    "description": "NATSEM child social exclusion index (2006) by SLA boundaries in Australia. Brisbane SLAs have been aggregated up to Local Council Electoral Wards and ACT SLAs have been aggregated up to Statistical Sub-Divisions. The index is calculated based on data from the ABS Census of Population and Housing 2006. In the data, the lowest CSE quintile represents the highest risk of child social exclusion. The Child Social Exclusion Index estimates social exclusion risk at a small area level for children aged 0 - 4 , 5 - 15 and 0 - 15 years. The index is based on characteristics of children's parents, families and households, and includes data about parental partnership status, employment and volunteerism, family educational attainment and occupation, household income, housing, transport and internet connection. The index depends on the variables chosen to represent social exclusion and the methodology used to summarise these data. Prior to the indexation, NATSEM remove any SLAs that had low cell counts or had a very high non-response rate in the census. Low cell counts mean that even a very small change in the data can mean a large percentage change (so one extra child at risk of social exclusion may represent a 33 per cent increase if there are only 3 children in the SLA). To deal with the issue of low cell counts, NATSEM excluded from the analysis SLAs with fewer than 30 children in either the 0-4 or 5-15 age groups. These SLAs are noted with an asterisk (*).",

    "description": "Interned: Torrens Island, 1914-1915\nIn August 1914 war broke out across Europe. Within days ‘enemy subjects’ in Australia were required to register with the authorities. Most gave their ‘parole’ and went on with their lives in the community, but internment started with sailors taken off enemy ships and enemy reservists, and went on to include enemy subjects suspected of ‘disloyal or unsatisfactory’ behaviour. Later, some naturalised British subjects and even natural-born British subjects were interned. In the course of the war over 6,000 enemy subjects were interned across Australia. \nThis dataset contains information about individuals interned during the First World War from South Australia (Military District 4). Most of those interned between October 1914 and August 1915, some 400 men, were held on Torrens Island, in the Port River estuary, north-west of Adelaide. The data set also includes those from South Australia who were interned in New South Wales after Torrens Island internment camp closed in August 1915.\nThe data was compiled by History SA staff from two archival series in the National Archives of Australia: A367 C18000 Part 1, War Internees and Deportees 1914-1919 and D2286, Nominal Roll of prisoners of war interned at Torrens Island concentration camp 1915. Data fields include: Name, Also recorded as (alternative name), Date interned, Interned (at), Nationality, Date of birth/age, Remarks, and Notes. The data has been produced by identifying individuals who appear in both series and combining information from both series into this data set, using the A367 data as the primary series. This involved interpreting the data, in particular, making an assessment of whether or not entries in the two series with similar names represent the same person. Further research may reveal some of these assessments to be inaccurate.\nThe dataset was produced as part of research for an exhibition at the Migration Museum and the Wakefield Press publication Interned: Torrens Island, 1914-15.\nhttp://migration.historysa.com.au/events/2014/interned-torrens-island-1914-1915\nhttp://www.wakefieldpress.com.au/product.php?productid=1201",

    "title": "Climate Vulnerability Assessment: Dryland Barley",
    "description": "The <strong>Climate Vulnerability Assessment</strong> was designed to provide an overview of the impact of future climate change on all stages of production for the commodities and biosecurity risks assessed. The project used multicriteria analysis (MCA) models to produce assessments for the commodities and biosecurity risks in a consistent and comparable way, and a framework was developed to provide a rigorous, flexible and transparent process for assessing vulnerabilities and opportunities to climate change. Details of the approach and the climate data used in the assessments can be found in the <a href=\"https://www.dpi.nsw.gov.au/dpi/climate/climate-vulnerability-assessment/publications-and-reports\">Methodology Report</a> which also details model exclusions and assumptions.\n\nAssessments were undertaken on commodities grouped into 6 nodes: <em>Horticulture and Viticulture</em>, <em>Broadacre Cropping</em>, <em>Forestry</em>, <em>Extensive Livestock</em>, <em>Marine Fisheries</em>, as well as for a set of biosecurity risks related to these primary industry sectors. The <a href=\"https://www.dpi.nsw.gov.au/dpi/climate/climate-vulnerability-assessment/publications-and-reports\">Summary Report</a> gives details of the chosen commodities and biosecurity risks and summarises the high-level results.\n\nResults Reports for each commodity and biosecurity risk are being released. Visit the <a href=\"https://www.dpi.nsw.gov.au/dpi/climate/climate-vulnerability-assessment\">project's web pages</a> to access these reports and for further information.\n\nThis dataset contains maps of modelled climate suitability for the <strong>dryland barley</strong> model in the Broadacre Cropping node of the DPIRD Climate Vulnerability Assessment. Maps are provided (in GeoTIFF format) for each element of the model: the overall climate suitability, climate suitability maps for each phenophase and also for each phenophase/climate variable combination in the model. Data is provided for each of the eight global climate models (GCMs) used in the project, as well as the climate suitability derived from historical observations, along with the ensemble median for each map.",

The Our City's Little Gems project is a direct extension of The Little Things that Run the City project that assessed the insect biodiversity of green spaces in the City of Melbourne. The Little Things that Run the City project did not originally feature butterflies, so the Our City’s Little Gems project was created to solely look at butterfly-flower interactions in our city. Please use the detailed legend for all species, environmental and location information. All species records are butterflies. All records have coordinates.",

This analysis reflects the generalist habitat condition assigned to every 15m grid cell across the ACT region and the context or combined habitat values of the grids that surround it or are in its near vicinity. Patches are defined by polygons that include all adjoining grid cells that are in the highest 20% for spatial context for all grid cells across the ACT Region. The legend indicates patches that are &gt;10ha or that are from 5 – 10 ha.  Indicates resource availability for an animal at that cell.\nThe ACT connectivity mapping was undertaken by the NSW Office of Environment and Heritage. A full study report has been produced, and is entitled Fine Scale Modelling of Fauna Habitat and Connectivity Values in the ACT Region. This study built upon an earlier report entitled the Ecological Connectivity for Climate Change in the ACT and surrounding region, commissioned by the ACT Government as part of Weathering the Change Action Plan 1. The report was undertaken by the Fenner School of Environment and Society, Australian National University. It is recommended that both reports be consulted when use is being made of the connectivity mapping available. Reports can be downloaded from the EPD website at https://www.act.gov.au/environment/research-and-data/conservation-research-and-technical-reports (Technical reports 21 and 27).\ngen_blank20pc_ctx \nGridcode\n0 = &lt;10ha\n1 = &gt;10ha\nPatchcode\n-1= Not a patch\n0= Patch 5-10ha\n1= Patch 10ha&lt;\nUpdates: This dataset is static.\nFit for purpose: 2012 temporal coverage. This dataset should be used as a modelled tool for aiding landuse, strategic town planning, and conservation planning in the ACT including revegetation targets and informing environmental impacts of infrastructure and building projects.

It holds a record for each PFI in the PARCEL_VIEW table, and the DISPLAY column has a value indicating whether the polygon is Inside, Outside, or Both (partly inside and partly outside) a DISPLAY_VIEW_POLYGON polygon.\n\nThis dataset provides a way of limiting the display of parcel_view polygons so maps can be drawn efficiently.  Polygons with a DISPLAY value of I (inside) can be drawn at larger scales (eg 1:5000), while those with O (outside) can be drawn at smaller scales (eg. 1:50,000). This means rural areas can be displayed at a suitable scale, without the burden of displaying polygons in a town. A DISPLAY value of B (both) is used for some polygons which can be displayed at both scales. These can be rivers, or multi-part polygons with parts inside and outside the DVP. \n\nTo use this flag for drawing a join is needed - parcel_view.pfi = parcel_view_dvp.parcel_view_pfi",

    "description": "In March 2003, banks and selected Registered Financial Corporations (RFCs) began reporting their international assets, liabilities and country exposures to APRA in ARF/RRF 231 International Exposures. This return is the basis of the data provided by Australia to the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) for its International Banking Statistics (IBS) data collection. APRA ceased the RFC data collection after September 2010.\r\n\r\nThe IBS data are based on the methodology described in the BIS Guide on International Financial Statistics (see http://www.bis.org/statistics/intfinstatsguide.pdf; Part II International banking statistics). Data reported for Australia, and other countries, on the BIS website are expressed in United States dollars (USD).\r\n\r\nData are recorded on an end-quarter basis.\r\n\r\nThere are two sets of IBS data: locational data, which are used to gauge the role of banks and financial centres in the intermediation of international capital flows; and consolidated data, which can be used to monitor the country risk exposure of national banking systems. Only consolidated data are reported in this statistical table.\r\n\r\nData are shown for a range of countries and regions. Similar data for a selected group of countries are also available in statistical table B13.1.\r\n\r\nCountry and regional groupings are based on the classification used in the IBS.\r\n\r\nData presented in this statistical table are immediate risk claims (expressed by the BIS as claims on an immediate borrower basis), which cover exposures on an immediate counterparty location basis. Ultimate risk claims are presented in complementary statistical tables B13.2 and B13.2.1, which cover immediate exposures adjusted (via guarantees and other risk transfers) to reflect the location of the ultimate counterparty/risk.\r\n\r\nInternational claims represent cross-border claims in all currencies and foreign offices’ local claims in non-local currencies (which would include, for example, USD claims on New Zealand residents by the New Zealand subsidiary of an Australian-owned bank).\r\n\r\nThis statistical table contains seven data worksheets. Six present data for countries within each specified region, while the 'Summary' worksheet shows total international claims of the globally consolidated operations of Australian-owned banks for each region, international organisations and unallocated. In each of these worksheets, the data in the last column measures total international claims for the region. Total international claims for each country add to total international claims for the region. However, in some quarters, this cannot be directly verified because data for individual countries and regions have blank entries in order to avoid disclosing confidential bank exposures.\r\n\r\nIn the 'Summary' worksheet, the positions by region and international organisation, and unallocated are summed to produce a ‘Total’ figure that represents reporting entities’ total international exposures.\r\n",

    "title": "SAIMOS - Biological and Flow Cytometry data collected from CTD stations in South Australia, in March 2011",
    "description": "Flow cytometry data was collected in March 2011, in waters off South Australia. \n\nThe general purpose of the study is to be able to establish background knowledge on the ecosystem on the continental shelf of South Australia and the impact of upwelling/saline outflow events on microbial communities to ultimately develop a biogeochemical model of the region. Sampling was carried out during cruises conducted on board the RV Ngerin as part of the Southern Australian Integrated Marine System (SAIMOS). During each cruise, the physical, chemical and biological properties of the chlorophyll fluorescence maximum (FM) layer were investigated. Flow cytometry data is normally collected for picophytoplankton, bacteria and viruses, but not on this cruise\n\nSix main stations have been sampled over the course of the study, five are located on the 100 m isobath, i.e. RS (35.508S, 136.278E), B2 (35.418S, 136.148E), B3 (35.258S, 136.048E), B4 (35.168S, 135.418E) and B5 (35.008S, 135.198E), and one from an offshore station (B1; 36.188S, 136.178E) located southwest of Kangaroo Island. Note that combining the distances between stations (14–25 nautical miles), the average component of the current velocity at middepth along the shelf (0.01 m s21) and the average speed of the vessel (i.e. 9 knots) indicate that different water masses were sampled at each station. Additional samples have on occasion been collected from the National Reference Station (NRS) at Kangaroo Island (35.832S, 136.447E) and the SA Spencer Gulf Mouth Mooring (SAM8SG, 35.25S, 136.690E), where the saline outflow occurs.",

The data is based on the recipient's geocoded address aggregated by Statistical Area Level 2 (SA2) from the Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS) 2011.\nThe Department of Social Services (DSS) is the Australian Government's lead agency in the development and delivery of social policy, and is working to improve the lifetime wellbeing of people and families in Australia. DSS' policies and services respond to need across people's lives - looking after families, children and older people; providing a safety net for people who cannot fully support themselves; enhancing the wellbeing of people with high needs; assisting people who need help with care; and supporting a diverse and harmonious society. DSS supports people and families in Australia by encouraging independence and participation, and supporting a cohesive society.\nFor more information on this dataset please visit the Australian Government Open Data.\nFor further details on payments, see 'A guide to Australian Government payments'.\nPlease note:\n\n\nIn order to protect individuals' privacy, identified populations between 1 and 19 have been suppressed and replaced with '&lt;20' for confidentiality purposes. Additional data may be suppressed and replaced with 'n.p.' (not provided) to prevent the derivation of identified populations that have values of less than 20.\n\n\nCaveats specific to payments type can be found in the relevant payment description of the original data.\n\n\nAURIN has spatialised this dataset and have made the following replacements to enforce data type consistency: \n\n\n'&lt;20' has been assigned a value of '-1' within the data\n\n\nA boolean field has been created for each data field to flag left-censored data. 'True' is assigned to fields that have been censored.\n\n\n'n.p.' (not provided) has been set to Null within the data.\n\n",

    "description": "At the request of the Tasmanian Hydro-Electric Commission a geophysical survey was carried out along a tunnel line at Trevallyn, a suburb of Launceston, North Eastern Tasmania. The excavation of the Trevallyn tunnel is part of the Hydro-Electric Trevallyn Power Development project to utilise the water of the South Esk river for generation of electric power. The construction works are already well advanced. A dam is being built on the river at the Second Basin. Water from the catchment will be diverted through a tunnel two miles long to a power station situated at sea level on the Tamar River. A locality map is given in Plate 1. Three geophysical exploration methods, electrical, seismic and gravitational, were used to locate deeply weathered and fractured zones in the dolerite bedrock, through which the tunnel is being driven.",

    "description": "This dataset presents the synthetically modeled indicators relating to the life satisfaction of the population of small regions of Australia based on the 2016 Census and aggregated following the 2016 edition of the Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS). The synthetic indicators are produced by the spatial micro-simulation model (SpatialMSM). The data has been provided by The National Centre for Social and Economic Modelling (NATSEM).\nNATSEM’s spatial microsimulation model uses a technique that takes a survey and reweights it to small area Census data. SpatialMSM18 is the application of the NATSEM Spatial Microsimulation model using the Household, Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia (HILDA) dataset, the ABS Housing Expenditure Survey (for financial stress) and the 2016 Census of Population and Housing at the SA2 level (Tanton et al. 2011). All the indicators from the SpatialMSM model are synthetic, so there is some model error as well as other error from the survey. Therefore, they are not as accurate as the Census data used.\nData in this dataset comes from NATSEM's spatial microsimulation model. Estimates are for subjective life satisfaction based on questions in the HILDA dataset. A full description of the model, and validation, can be found in the accompanying NATSEM Technical Report.\nPlease note: \n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data provided directly from NATSEM.\n\n\nWhere data values are NULL, the data is either unpublished or not applicable mathematically.\n\n\nThe treatment of Not Stated and Overseas Visitor data is to exclude them from both the numerator and the denominator.\n\n",

    "description": "Study Area\n\nThe study area is located in south west Sydney at the northern end of the suburbs of Revesby and\nPadstow. It is an urban catchment that drains in an easterly direction through a stormwater pipe and\nopen channel network to Salt Pan Creek, a tributary of the Georges River. The catchment includes\nthe South Western Motorway (M5) east from approximately Queen Street to Salt Pan Creek. The\nRiver Road, Gibson Avenue and Fairford Road cross the catchment (and the motorway via\noverpasses) in approximately a north-south direction. The Fairford Road catchment is wholly within\nthe Bankstown City local government area (LGA).\n\nOutcomes from the Study\n\nThe main outcomes from this study include:\n<ul>\n<li>A database of all Council drainage assets within the study area;</li>\n<li>Establishment of a computer model capable of assessing flood behaviour;</li>\n<li>Information on flood behaviour under existing catchment conditions;</li>\n<li>Predicted change in flood levels due to the potential impacts of climate change; and</li>\n<li>A model that can be used to assess flood mitigation options and future development proposals.</li>\n</ul>\n\nDatabase of Drainage Assets\n\nAll drainage asset data collected by Council for the study has been incorporated into a GIS database.\n\nThis allows the data to be spatially represented across the study area and easily retrieved as\nrequired. Information in the database includes data for some 240 Council stormwater pits and 310\nstormwater drainage pipes.\n\nOther catchment data, including aerial photography, property cadastre, building footprints and the\nterrain surface (based on ALS survey) is also incorporated into a GIS database.\n\nComputer Modelling\n\nA numerical computer model was developed for the catchment to simulate flood behaviour, using the\nsoftware TUFLOW. Surface flows are represented in the model through a two-dimensional grid\ncovering the entire study area. The stormwater pit and pipe network is included as one-dimensional\nelements within this grid. Full details of the modelling approach, modelling parameters and other\nassumptions are outlined in the Fairford Road Catchment Flood Modelling Report, which is included\nas Appendix C.\n\nExisting Flood Behaviour\n\nDesign flood behaviour has been computed for a range of floods, ranging from relatively frequent\nevents to more extreme floods.\nThe model produces a grid of results over the study area providing data on flood levels, flood depths\nand flood velocities. Flood level contours have also been prepared showing contours of flood heights\nthroughout the study area. This data is provided digitally and can be overlaid on base mapping such\nas aerial photos and cadastral plans showing property boundaries.\n\nAll flood model results have been provided to Council for incorporation into their GIS database. Much\nof this information is also included as A4 sized plans included in Appendix C.\nIt is understood that once the Flood Study has been adopted by Council, the GIS information\nresulting from this Flood Study will be used for floodplain management purposes, including\nassessment of flood-related development constraints on properties. Potential flood mitigation options\nwill be assessed in the subsequent Floodplain Risk Management Study phase of the floodplain risk\nmanagement process.",

    "description": "Fast radio bursts are peculiar micro-millisecond duration transients, which have been seen to be extragalactic in origin. Since their discovery, a dichotomy has emerged in their population. Some FRBs have been seen to be repeating, while others have not been seen to be repeating. The repeating FRBs, such as FRB 20180301A, provide an unparalleled window into their circumburst environment due to their repeating nature, which can be used to constrain possible progenitor models and test underlying emission mechanisms. Additionally, FRB 20180301A has been seen to have interesting polarisation properties, such as a switch in the sign of RM, indicating a reversal in the magnetic field and a marked reduction in the linear polarisation fraction towards lower frequencies (depolarisation). The previous Parkes/Murriyang source follow-up has also revealed a temporal evolution in the dispersion measure (DM) of the source and tentative evidence for correlation in the DM and rotation measure (RM). The ultra-wideband low (UWL) receiver on Parkes/Murriyang is ideally suited to explore the wideband spectro-temporal and polarimetric behaviour of the source. We propose regular monitoring of FRB 20180301A using UWL to model the magnetic field evolution, study its circumburst media using depolarisation behaviour, and constrain any correlation of DM and RM.",

    "description": "The Biodiversity component of the LTIM Project evaluated the contribution of Commonwealth environmental water to achieving diversity-related objectives of the Basin Plan by undertaking a qualitative evaluation of expected outcomes of watering actions undertaken by the CEWO. \r\n\r\nThe CEWO’s LTIM Project focused on examining the contribution of Commonwealth environmental water to the environmental objectives of the Basin Plan 2012 (Basin Plan), while assisting the CEWO to demonstrate environmental outcomes and adaptively manage the water holdings. Monitoring and evaluation was focused in seven Selected Areas: the Junction of the Warrego and Darling rivers, Gwydir river system, Lachlan river system, Murrumbidgee river system, Edward/Kolety-Wakool river system, Goulburn River and Lower Murray River. These areas will continue to be monitored through the CEWO’s Monitoring, Evaluation and Research (MER) Program.  \r\n\r\nData collected by monitoring at Selected Areas is used to evaluate local outcomes from watering and also contributed to the analysis and evaluation of Basin Plan objectives.\r\n\r\nThe main data output of the Biodiversity evaluation is an aggregated list of species and communities that potentially benefitted from Commonwealth environmental water from 2014-15 to 2018-19. This is derived from other Basin Matter reports (Vegetation, Fish, Ecosystem Diversity), Selected Area monitoring, the Atlas of Living Australia and monitoring programs external to LTIM (e.g. the Living Murray, Bird Life Australia). \r\n\r\nPlease refer to the Murray-Darling Basin LTIM Project: 2018-19 Basin-scale evaluation of Commonwealth environmental water – Biodiversity Report for the detailed method on data used for evaluation.  \r\n\r\n###Acknowledgement\r\n\r\nThe Commonwealth Environmental Water Office acknowledge the First Nations peoples as the Traditional Owners and Custodians of the lands, waterways and skies of the Murray-Darling Basin. We thank them for their knowledge and science and respect their continuing connection to culture and Country and the values reflected in these data.\r\n\r\n",

    "description": "Long-term average annual extraction limit (LTAAEL) is a regulatory limit set on annual water extractions from a river system. It ensures that average extractions over the long term are sustainable, and thus help prevent environmental degradation.\n\nIn NSW these limits are defined by water sharing plans (WSPs). Every WSP outlines how the water in a river system will be shared over a 10-year period. They also define:\n\n• how LTAAEL compliance is to be assessed for each river system\n\n• what conditions will trigger noncompliance action\n\n• what compliance action can be taken.\n\nThe Natural Resources Commission regularly reviews all WSPs to ensure extractions from each river system are within the limits set, and the Murray-Darling Basin Authority reviews sustainable diversion limit (SDL) compliance each year.\n\nTo assess compliance, we model LTAAEL using a model that has been configured to represent the development and management rules defined by a system WSP (this refers to as LTAAEL model). We then compare this modelled LTAAEL with the modelled under current conditions long-term average annual extractions (LTAAEs) (which are usually those modelled by the annual permitted take, or APT, model). Although, the LTAAEL includes multiple types of water use, the compliance assessment is based on the total. We do this annually using the best available models, and the outcomes are published on the DPE website.\n\nWhere river system’s LTAAE exceed LTAAEL, the system is considered noncompliant. If the noncompliance trigger conditions in the WSP are met, noncompliance action is taken.\n\nThe data set provided contains flows at several gauges in each river system, as simulated by the annually extended LTAAEL model. Notwithstanding the model’s inherent limitations, these are a fair representation of those we would expect under WSP operation and development conditions. They can be compared with flows simulated by other key scenario models, such as annual permitted take (APT) model or without development (WOD) model.",

    "description": "    \n\nMean annual (00) and monthly (01a|12) transpiration (mm) from the plant canopy\nfor the period 1980-1999.Interpretation:Canopy transpiration is far more\nspatially variable than potential evaporation, reflecting the effects of water\nlimitation in most areas of the continent. Both the annual mean and seasonal\npattern broadly resemble the corresponding patterns for rainfall. Canopy\ntranspiration maps have more acontrasta (relative variation) than the total\nevaporation or rainfall maps because transpiration is a small component of\ntotal evaporation in areas of low plant cover (the remainder being soil\nevaporation).The partitioning between soil evaporation and canopy\ntranspiration in the model is determined by leaf area index.Notes: These are\nmodel-based estimates from the BiosEquil model. Results are given for the\naBASEa (pre-1788) and aAGRICa (present day) conditions.

    "description": "As part of the Australian Critical Minerals Research and Development Hub, Geoscience Australia is undertaking a detailed mineral potential study of High Purity Silica (HPS) to identify favourable geology and regions across Australia that have the greatest potential to supply raw material suitable for the production of silicon. This project undertook an extensive national sampling campaign of quartz-bearing rocks, acquired through a combination of field work, core shed and repository sampling, and contributions from both industry and State and Territory geological surveys. \n\nThis data release presents the complete bulk rock geochemical results, derived from field work in the Mt Isa, Pilbara, Victorian Goldfields, and Harts Range regions; samples from Geoscience Australia’s repository, the Londonderry and Tonsley drill core libraries; and samples provided by industry and State and Territory surveys. A total of 392 samples were analysed for major and trace element geochemistry.\n\nThe dataset will be used to inform priority mineral systems for high purity silica exploration, providing critical data and knowledge for the development of national-scale predictive mineral potential maps. Additionally, this dataset will support mineral exploration efforts across Australia by offering detailed geochemical analysis of quartz and pegmatite samples, including major and trace element compositions. These data are essential for advancing our understanding of high purity silica mineralisation and guiding future exploration activities.\n\nThis data release includes: 1) a complete geochemistry dataset, including all samples and standards; 2) quality assurance results; 3) an abridged Excel file with data removed for the standards, duplicates and any elements deemed unsuitable based upon the QA/QC; and 4) a report of explanatory notes including details of sample selection, methodology, and quality assurance.",

    "description": "Interim Biogeographic Regionalisation for Australia (IBRA) version 7.0 represents a landscape based approach to classifying the land surface of Australia. 89 biogeographic regions and 419 sub regions have been delineated, each reflecting a unifying set of major environmental influences which shape the occurrence of flora and fauna and their interaction with the physical environment across Australia and its external territories (excluding Antarctica). IBRA Version 7.0 data consists of two datasets. IBRA bioregions, which is a larger scale regional classification of homogenous ecosystems, and sub regions, which are more localised. IBRA Version 7.0 is the result of both significant changes to certain IBRA 6.1 boundaries, plus refinement of other boundaries due to better data availability amongst some states and territories, and alterations by the states/territories along state borders. The updated boundaries were jointly defined by the Commonwealth, State and Territory nature and conservation agencies. In this respect refinements were carried out to all mainland jurisdictions with significant changes in Queensland and South Australia. In addition the dataset was also updated to more closely conform to the Geoscience Australia 1:100K State borders, and a standard coding/naming convention introduced (for both regions and sub-regions) resulting in differences to both names and codes used in earlier IBRA Versions.\nVarious sources were used to delineate islands - these included the GA100K Admin layer plus the Australian Maritime Boundaries dataset, a Coral Sea dataset (held in ERIN) and the GA Commonwealth Fisheries 2006 dataset.CC - Attribution (CC BY)\nData to be available in the Public Domain under Creative Commons by Attribution Licensing Agreement. \nMore information can be found here: http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/au/deed.en\nUsers must attribute the Australian Government Department of the Environment and Energy as the data provider.",

    "title": "Denitrification measurements of sediments using cores and chambers: comparison of fluxes and denitrification efficiencies",
    "description": "Denitrification is a microbial process that takes place on and within sediment and results in the transformation of dissolved inorganic nitrogen to nitrogen gas (N2), which is subsequently lost to the atmosphere.  In coastal waters denitrification is an important pathway for the removal of excess nitrogen.  Rates of denitrification are typically quantified using either in situ benthic chambers or sediment cores incubated in the laboratory.  This study assesses if these two approaches give similar fluxes and denitrification efficiencies.  This dataset gives fluxes of: i) dissolved oxygen (DO); ii) nitrogen gas (N2); iii) dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN); iv) nitrate (NO3-); v); nitrite (NO2-) and vi) ammonium (NH4+) between the sediment and the water column.  Results are obtained using core cylinders incubated in the laboratory and in situ benthic chambers.  Fluxes are expressed as µmol m-2 of seafloor surface day-1.  Denitrification efficiency is also reported and represents the flux of N2 as a proportion of the total flux of DIN.  Studies were carried out in Port Phillip Bay at Clifton Springs and Williamstown, Victoria in March and May 2004, respectively. The flux of oxygen, ammonium, nitrate, nitrite and the denitrification efficiency was found to differ between in situ benthic chambers and laboratory incubated sediment cores.  Additional experiments were conducted to assess if the abundance of macrofauna in sediments of core cylinders and benthic chambers differed; and ii) if physical disturbance associated with the collection and transport of core cylinders could account for the observed differences.",

    "description": "This dataset presents counts of payment recipients by payment type for the quarter ending September 2015. The data is based on the recipient's geocoded address aggregated by Statistical Area Level 2 (SA2) from the Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS) 2011.\nThe Department of Social Services (DSS) is the Australian Government's lead agency in the development and delivery of social policy, and is working to improve the lifetime wellbeing of people and families in Australia. DSS' policies and services respond to need across people's lives - looking after families, children and older people; providing a safety net for people who cannot fully support themselves; enhancing the wellbeing of people with high needs; assisting people who need help with care; and supporting a diverse and harmonious society. DSS supports people and families in Australia by encouraging independence and participation, and supporting a cohesive society.\nFor more information on this dataset please visit the Australian Government Open Data.\nFor further details on payments, see 'A guide to Australian Government payments'.\nPlease note:\n\n\nIn order to protect individuals' privacy, identified populations between 1 and 19 have been suppressed and replaced with '&lt;20' for confidentiality purposes. Additional data may be suppressed and replaced with 'n.p.' (not provided) to prevent the derivation of identified populations that have values of less than 20.\n\n\nCaveats specific to payments type can be found in the relevant payment description of the original data.\n\n\nAURIN has spatialised this dataset and have made the following replacements to enforce data type consistency: \n\n\n'&lt;20' has been assigned a value of '-1' within the data\n\n\nA boolean field has been created for each data field to flag left-censored data. 'True' is assigned to fields that have been censored.\n\n\n'n.p.' (not provided) has been set to Null within the data.\n\n",

    "description": "Data of the risk of Potential Acid Sulfate Soil (PASS) materials being disturbed by land development activities based on the likelihood of PASS materials occurring within 3m of the ground surface for the Lower South West Region. This data is designed for use by planners to assess whether development applications for specific sites require additional conditions on the basis of whether normal land development activities carry a risk of disturbing PASS materials. Disturbance risk is rated on the basis of the likelihood of PASS materials being encountered within 3m of the ground surface should this depth of soil be disturbed in any way. The depth of 3m is considered since this was regarded as the depth that most soil disturbance activities would extend during in most land development processes. Disturbance activities in this context include drainage, excavations and dewatering. For further information phone the Contaminated Sites hotline 1300 762 982.\n\nThis dataset was formerly known as Acid Sulfate Soil Risk Map, Lower South West (DER-010).\nThis dataset is no longer actively maintained by DWER.",

    "description": "    \r\n\r\nDefinition: Mean annual dissolved concentration of mineral nitrogen in soil\r\nwater (mg of nitrogen per kg of water), averaged for both soil layers.\r\nInterpretation: The dissolved N concentration is calculated as the ratio of\r\nthe mineral N store to soil water store, which assumes that all the mineral N\r\nis in solution. Rainfall has a strong influence on the pattern of both these\r\nstores, but not on their ratio. The pattern of mineral N concentrations is\r\nexplained by the effect of air dryness (saturation deficit) on the mineral N\r\nstore (mainly controlled by NPP) which is greater than the effect of air\r\ndryness on the soil water store (mainly determined by rainfall or energy\r\nlimitation). This gives a pattern of N concentration in soil water that\r\ndecreases as the climate-average air dryness increases from temperate to semi-\r\narid tropical environments. Notes: These are model-based estimates from the\r\nBiosEquil model. Results are given for the aBasea (pre-1788) and aAgrica\r\n(present day) conditions. The aAgrica case includes (1) current agricultural\r\ninputs of water from irrigation; (2) current agricultural inputs of nutrients\r\n(nitrogen and phosphorus) from fertiliser, legume crops, and legume pastures;\r\n(3) current nutrient offtakes by product removal (harvest, stock).\r\nNMnlConc0.Agric a Mean annual concentration of mineral nitrogen in soil water\r\n(mgN kgH2O-1) in the aAgrica (present day) scenario NMnlConc0.Base a Mean\r\nannual concentration of mineral nitrogen in soil water (mgN kgH2O-1) in the\r\naBasea (pre-1788) scenario Data is in geographics and GDA94.\r\n\r\nSee [further metadata](http://data.daff.gov.au/anrdl/metadata_files/pa_cmnswr9cl\r\n__02811a01.xml) for more detail.\r\n\r\n",

    "description": "<strong>The Georgetown, Queensland, 2024 Airborne Electromagnetic Survey </strong>was conducted by Geoscience Australia in collaboration with the Geological Survey of Queensland. The survey aimed to enhance geological understanding and support mineral exploration and groundwater research in the region.\n\nThe primary goal was to acquire detailed electromagnetic and magnetic geophysical data to improve understanding of subsurface geological formations, which could aid in mineral exploration and groundwater studies. This survey will be included in the national AusAEM airborne electromagnetic acquisition program, which aims to provide geophysical information to support investigations of regional geology and groundwater systems. This data will help to better characterise architecture of aquifers within the upper 200-300 hundred meters of the subsurface. It will also provide insights to trends in regolith thickness and variability, variations in bedrock conductivity, the conductivity of key bedrock (lithology-related) conductive units under cover, and the groundwater systems of the region at a reconnaissance scale.\n\nNew Resolution Geophysics Pty. Ltd. (NRG) was commissioned for data acquisition and processing. The survey was carried out between August and November 2024, covering 10,600 flight-line kilometres with a nominal line spacing of 2 kilometres. NRG’s XCITE™ airborne electromagnetic system was used to collect the data. The survey lines were oriented East-West, with a nominal terrain clearance of 40 meters. Subsurface conductivity models were derived using Geoscience Australia’s deterministic, 1D Layered-Earth Inversion (GALEI) code combined with noise estimates determined by NRG.\n\nThe data package also contains the results and derived products from data Geoscience Australia staff inverted using Internally developed sample-by-sample deterministic layered-earth (1D) inversion algorithm GALEISBS.\n\n\n<b>NRG delivered data is available on request from clientservices@ga.gov.au - Quote eCat# 150184</b>",

An Opal trip is where an Opal card is used to tap-on and tap-off, including where a single tap-on or tap-off is recorded.

Since the introduction of Opal, this has been replaced by Peak Train Load Estimates from 2017 using the Rail Opal Assignment Model (ROAM). \nPeak Train Estimates use data extracted from the Rail Opal Assignment Model (ROAM). This model assigns Opal journeys to services based on the rail daily working timetable and train punctuality data. The customer load is aggregated to train services and assigned to rail lines.\nTrain station entries and exits dataset is based on the average of three day sample, representing 'a typical day' of customer entries and exits at each train station.

    "description": "Lizard Island is located in the Northern Great Barrier Reef province, approximately 270km north of Cairns. Reef drilling was undertaken to investigate the Holocene evolution of the fringing reefs of Lizard Island. Radiocarbon dating of the cored coral material was then used to establish the chronology of the reef and to quantify the rate of development. \n\nThree drill cores were extracted, all from the windward margin because the leeward margin was too deep to access and did not form a conventional reef flat margin. The maximum depth reached was 4.5 m in core L1, with cores L2 and L3 being abandoned after encountering thick sand layers. \n\nThe cores were logged and photographed, and thin sections were made and petrographically examined. Corals that were determined to be in situ (by the orientation of their corallites) and free from internal cement and detritus by microscope examination were selected for radiocarbon dating.\n\nRadiocarbon dates indicate that the fringing reef at Lizard Island started growing directly on an assumed granite basement approximately 6.7 cal kyr BP at approximately 4.5 m below the reef flat surface. The windward margin at Lizard Island approached modern day sea level approximately 4 cal kyr BP. Rates of vertical accretion ranged from 0.5 to 0.7 m/kyr at Lizard Island.",

    "description": "Data describes vegetation extent priorities for each stream reach across the Melbourne Water region. Each reach is classified as either high, medium or low priority. To meet the performance objectives of the Healthy Waterways Strategy 2018 (HWS2018), high priority reaches need to be revegetated by 2028. To meet the target trajectory scores of the Healthy Waterways Strategy, medium priority reaches need to be revegetated by 2068. Vegetation priority reaches were determined by a combination of decision support tools and the co-design process. The decision support tool used was Zonation, which prioritised management actions across the region with the objective of improving instream habitat suitability for platypus, fish and macroinvertebrates.\n\n\n\nFor the most up-to-date performance objectives, see the co-designed Catchment Programs at: <a href=\"https://www.melbournewater.com.au/about-us/strategies-achievements-and-policies/healthy-waterways-strategy\">https://www.melbournewater.com.au/about-us/strategies-achievements-and-policies/healthy-waterways-strategy</a> \n\n\n\nResults are considered fit for purpose (i.e. for waterway planning). This data set covers the entire Melbourne Water region with the exception of very small areas close to Port Phillip Bay or Western Port. For example, there are small areas of French Island which are not captured.\n\n\n\nThis data set was created using: 1. Streams dataset for the Healthy Waterways Strategy 2018. This layer was developed by GraceGIS using Melbourne Water layers as inputs.\n\n\n\nFor further reading on the prioritisation process see:\n\n• Chee et al. (in development), Habitat Suitability Models, Scenarios and Quantitative Action Prioritisation (using Zonation) for Melbourne Water’s Healthy Waterways Strategy: A Resource Document, University of Melbourne and Melbourne Water for Melbourne Waterways Research Practice Partnership\n\n• Melbourne Water (in development), Healthy Waterways Strategy Resource Document, Presentation of revegetation priority reaches for the Healthy Waterways Strategy 2018.\n\n\n\nNOTE: Whilst every effort has been taken in collecting, validating and providing the attached data, Melbourne Water Corporation makes no representations or guarantees as to the accuracy or completeness of this data.

    "description": "The data for this map were collected as part of two ASAC projects - 488 and 956, of which Patricia Selkirk was the chief investigator. Macquarie Island (54 degrees S 159 degrees E) is a subantarctic island (c. 35km by 3 to 5km) approximately equidistant between Tasmania, New Zealand and Antarctica in the Southern Ocean. The vegetation is herbaceous, lacking shrubs and trees. Vegetation and drainage are mapped at a scale of 1:25 000 from field observations, satellite imagery and limited oblique and aerial photography. The categories adopted for mapping vegetation are based on attributes of foliage height and percentage foliage cover of the ground surface (vegetation structure), not on species distribution (floristics). The distribution of vegetation categories is strongly correlated with aspect, topography and rock type. Mires, streams and lakes form an intricate drainage pattern that is strongly influenced by the geology of this tectonically active emergent crest of the submarine Macquarie Ridge at the boundary of the Pacific and Australian plates. The drainage pattern of the whole island is represented in a map with substantially greater accuracy than in any previous map.",

This includes bibliographic information about the item (title, publisher, date, description, subject, ISBN, etc.) and activity details for each view (date/time, onsite/offsite, display image URL, etc.). \n\nAdditional background information can be found at: https://www.slq.qld.gov.au/blog/slq-unstacked \n\nExplore State Library’s events, programs and services at https://slq.qld.gov.au ",

    "description": "The Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS) began in 1948, and continues to provide timely, reliable and affordable access to necessary medicines for Australians today. The PBS is managed by the Department of Health and administered by the Department of Human Services.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Repatriation Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (RPBS) is subsidised by the [Department of Veterans' Affairs (DVA)] (http://www.dva.gov.au/), and can be used by veterans who have a DVA White, Gold or Orange Card. \r\n\r\nUnder the PBS, which includes the RPBS, the Australian government subsidises the cost of medicine for most medical conditions. Most of the listed medicines are dispensed by pharmacists, and used by patients at home. Some medicines are administered in hospital.  Read more [about the PBS](http://www.pbs.gov.au/info/about-the-pbs) on their website.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe [PBS Schedule](http://www.pbs.gov.au/browse/medicine-listing) is part of the wider Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme and lists all of the medicines available to be dispensed to patients at a Government-subsidised price. The Schedule is updated monthly.  \r\n  \r\n**The Patient Category Report:** this report contains the number and total benefit amount of PBS and RPBS services by patient category. The patient category determines how much the patient contributes to the cost of their medicine and refers to the patient's eligibility status at the time of supply of the benefit. Patient categories are listed in the file's metadata. Current and historical patient co-payment amounts and safety net thresholds can be found on the [PBS website] (http://www.pbs.gov.au/pbs/home). \r\n  \r\nStatistics are supplied for both the PBS and RPBS, and are provided in the following formats:\r\n\r\n\r\n**Excel:** The human readable data for the current year is located in an individual excel file. Historical data (1992-2014) may be found in the relevant zipped excel file.  \r\n**CSV:** The machine readable data for the current year is provided in an individual csv file. Historical data (1992-2014) may be found in the relevant zipped csv file.\r\n\r\nAdditional [Medicare statistics](http://www.humanservices.gov.au/corporate/statistical-information-and-data/medicare-statistics) may be found on the Department of Human Services website and data.gov.au.  \r\n  \r\nDisclaimer: The information and data contained in the reports and tables have been provided by Medicare Australia for general information purposes only.

    "title": "Heat Vulnerability Index - City of Melbourne (SA1) 2021",
    "description": "Heat Vulnerability Index (HVI) including heat exposure, sensitivity, and adaptive capability indicators were created for City of Melbourne.The dataset supports the development of a national heat vulnerability assessment toolkit for Australia, designed to identify areas and populations most susceptible to heat-related risks. The project addresses the growing need for understanding the relationship between urbanization, land surface temperature (LST), and the urban heat island effect, particularly for vulnerable communities. Integrating satellite-derived environmental data (LST, Normalized Difference Built-up Index (NDBI), Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI)) with socioeconomic data, this toolkit provides a comprehensive resource for building heat-resilient cities and suburbs.\nThis dataset includes both raw environmental data for the 2020-2021 Australian summer (November to March) and a calculated Heat Vulnerability Index (HVI) aggregated to the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) Statistical Area Level 1 (SA1) polygon dataset. The HVI, based on the IPCC's vulnerability conceptual framework, is a composite index comprised of three core components: heat exposure (derived from LST), sensitivity to heat (influenced by socioeconomic factors), and adaptive capability. Each SA1 is assigned a vulnerability rating ranging from 0 to 5, with 0 indicating no population and 5 representing high vulnerability, based on the aggregated indicator scores and quartile distribution.\nThe methodology employs Google Earth Engine (GEE) to derive LST, NDBI, and NDVI.  The HVI, along with its components, allows for spatial analysis and facilitates understanding of the complex relationships between heat, environmental factors, and socioeconomic conditions, enabling targeted policy and decision-making at local levels. This work aims to support dynamic and interactive vulnerability assessment, enabling users to update and construct their own indicators and indices for diverse applications.\nDetailed methodology for HVI generation can be found in this paper. Additional resources are available on the project's GitHub repository, the web application, and the toolkit.",

    "description": "In 2011 AAM Pty Ltd was commissioned by the Commonwealth to obtain orthophotography of the Cocos (Keeling) Islands. Between the 8th and 16th of August 2011 orthophotography was obtained for the entire extent of the islands (including North Keeling Island) by AAM Pty Ltd using a fixed-wing light aircraft. Previously, aerial photography was captured for Cocos (Keeling) Islands in 1987 and satellite imagery in 2004. The 2011 imagery has a 15cm on ground pixel size resolution, an improvement on all previous imagery.\nUsing an automated process, raw images were joined to form two mosaics, one of the Cocos southern lagoon and one of North Keeling Island. Colour balancing and replacement of certain areas with alternate raw images was performed for consistency. As a guide, the orthophotography is horizontally accurate to 30cm. \nThe orthophotography was provided to Geoscience Australia in UTM WGS 47S. All imagery was captured using a DiMAC UltraLight 50mm Lens camera within approximately 2 hours of low tide. During this period tides ranged from 0.4m to 1.3m. Flying height was around 800 meters with flight line spacing of around half a kilometre. The clarity and resolution is an improvement on the 2006 satellite imagery. \nDisclaimer",

    "description": "This dataset presents statistics about the businesses which are involved with tourism in specific Local Government Areas (LGA) around Australia. The LGAs covered in the data are a subset of the LGA boundaries classified in the 2016 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nThe data represents information about the number of businesses involved in tourism by the number of employees they have employed. The data was sourced for the year 2016.\nTourism Research Australia (TRA) first developed Local Government Area tourism profiles in 2007 to assist industry and Government decision making and to identify and support investment opportunities, particularly in regional Australia. The latest profiles provide an update for over 200 Local Government Areas. Data are drawn from TRA's International Visitor Survey (IVS) and National Visitor Survey (NVS), along with demographic and business data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS). Profiles were only prepared for Local Government Areas with adequate International Visitor Survey (IVS) and National Visitor Survey (NVS) sample to present robust results.\nFor more information please visit the Website of the TRA.\nPlease note: \n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data.\n\n\nWhere data values were, \"np\", not published or \"-\", not available, in the original data, they have been set to null.\n\n",

    "description": "This release consists of flux tower measurements of the exchange of energy and mass between the surface and the atmospheric boundary-layer using eddy covariance techniques. Data were processed using PyFluxPro (v3.4.17) as described by Isaac et al. (2017). PyFluxPro produces a final, gap-filled product with Net Ecosystem Exchange (NEE) partitioned into Gross Primary Productivity (GPP) and Ecosystem Respiration (ER).\n\nThis is a topographically flat area, primarily comprised of the following soil types: sandy loams, scattered clays, red brown earths, transitional red brown earth, sands over clay and deep sands. Stream valleys and layered soil and sedimentary materials are found across the landscape.\n\nThe flux station tower extends to 20&nbsp;m, however flux measurements are recorded from slightly lower than this. Mean annual precipitation from the nearby Bureau of Meteorology is 465&nbsp;mm. Maximum temperatures ranged from 16.6&nbsp;°C (in July) to 37.4&nbsp;°C (in January), while minimum temperatures ranged from 11.8&nbsp;°C (in July) to 29.0&nbsp;°C (in January). Maximum temperatures varied on a seasonal basis by approximately 20.8&nbsp;°C and minimum temperatures by 17.2&nbsp;°C. \n\nThe site is within a wider research area (60 x 60&nbsp;km) that supports a network of flux stations, which have been in operation since late 2001.",

    "title": "Derelict fishing line on fringing reefs of inshore groups of the GBR, 2007-2009 (NERP 8.2, JCU)",
    "description": "This dataset consists of site means of the density of derelict fishing line, the percent cover of major benthic categories on fringing coral reefs of the Keppel, Whitsunday and Palm Island groups, and the accumulation rate of fishing line at ten sites in the Palm Islands between 2007 and 2009. \r\n\r\nMonofilament nylon fishing line is persistent in the marine environment and once entangled in the reef, it can remain in place for many years. Temporal monitoring of the relative number of fishing lines recorded at each site can be used as a proxy for fishing effort. During the last few years we have established a collaboration with ReefCheck Australia to enhance this aspect of the project. In 2007, volunteer divers were tasked with removing all derelict fishing lines from a subset of the monitoring sites in the Palm Islands.  In the last few years, the rate of line re-accumulation has been monitored to gauge relative levels of fishing effort and zoning compliance. \r\n\r\n\r\nMethods:\r\n\r\nUnderwater visual census (UVC) was used to survey derelict fishing lines at 30 sites in the Palm Islands, 42 sites in the Whitsunday Islands and 22 sites in the Keppel Islands during 2009.  Within each island group, half of the sites (n = 47) were located on reefs within NTMRs and half  (n = 47) were on reefs that are open to fishing (non-NTMR).  A proportion of the NTMR sites in each island group were located within ¿old¿ reserves (NTMR 1987) protected since 1987; while others were located within ¿new¿ reserves (NTMR 2004) protected since 2004.\r\n\r\nFive replicate 50 m x 6 m (300 m²) UVC transects were surveyed at each monitoring site by two observers using SCUBA.  The total survey area at each site was 1500 m2.  Transect tapes were deployed along reef slopes, parallel to the reef crest and at a depth between 4 m and 9 m depending on the reef slope topography at each site.\r\nThe benthic community was surveyed using a standard line intercept survey method every 1 m along each transect (50 points per transect). Hard corals were classified as live or dead and assigned into morphological categories (branching, digitate, plate, massive, foliose, encrusting). Other categories of benthos included soft coral, sponges, clams (Tridacna spp.), other invertebrates (such as ascidians and anemones), macro-algae, coral reef pavement, rock, rubble and sand. Reef structural complexity was estimated using a five-point scale for both reef slope angle and rugosity. Five independent structural complexity estimates were made for each transect. Underwater visibility was recorded on each transect and ranged from 6 m to 12 m. Surveys did not proceed if the visibility was less than 5 m.\r\n\r\nTeams of volunteer divers from Reef Check Australia carried out the removal of derelict fishing lines at ten of the monitoring sites in the Palm Islands during April 2007. Five of the cleaned sites were located on reefs within NTMRs and five were on non-NTMR reefs. Four of the cleaned NTMR sites were located on the leeward side of Orpheus Island (NTMR 1987) and one site was at Curacoa Island (NTMR 2004). Of the cleaned non-NTMR sites, four were located on the leeward side of Pelorus Island and one was at Curacoa Island. The ten cleaned sites were randomly selected from a pool of eighteen sites that were in sheltered (leeward) locations and were identified as being readily accessible by fishers during calm to moderate (< 15 knots of wind) weather conditions. \r\n\r\nAt each site, divers removed all sighted derelict fishing lines and tackle (hooks, sinkers, wire leaders etc.) on reef slopes between 4 m and 12 m depth, for 200 m in both directions from a central GPS waypoint marking the site position. Transect tapes were deployed to measure the distance covered and increase the search efficiency so that very few, if any, derelict fishing lines remained after cleanup operations were completed. Derelict lines that were overgrown with hard coral or encrusting sponges, or partially embedded in the reef matrix were cut, and all of the exposed (visible) sections of line were removed. All collected fishing lines were recorded on data sheets before being placed in catch bags and taken back to the boat for later disposal.  \r\n\r\nBaseline UVC surveys of derelict fishing lines were conducted at each of the ten cleaned sites immediately prior to the removal of fishing lines in April 2007 and UVC surveys were subsequently repeated in December 2009, providing a 32 month period for fishing lines to re-accumulate on the reefs.  The 2007 and 2009 UVC surveys on the 10 cleaned sites used the same methodology described in the survey methods section above.  \r\n\r\nWe assumed that all of the fishing lines recorded and collected were lost at the same location in which they were found.  The authors recognize that the removal of derelict fishing line from ten of the thirty sites in the Palm Islands prior to the 2009 surveys would have reduced the fishing line density estimates for the Palm Islands.  However the magnitude of this effect was balanced between old and new NTMRs and non-NTMRs, as only one-third of the monitoring sites in each zone were cleaned.\r\n\r\n\r\nFormat:\r\n\r\nThe data are contained within two worksheets of an Excel file (20 kB). All benthic data is in % cover. Fishing line data are presented as both mean density (mean number of lines per 300 m2) and a total summed value for each site (total number of lines recorded per 1500m2). The first worksheet provides the site-level data for 2009. The second worksheet provides the accumulation rates of fishing lines at 10 monitoring sites in the Palm Islands between their removal in 2007 and the re-survey in 2009.\r\n\r\n\r\nData Dictionary:\r\n\r\nNames in brackets correspond to those used in the shapefile equivalents of the spreadsheet data. These names were adapted to work within the 10 character attribute limitation of shapefiles.\r\n- Fish Line_MEAN (FishLineMn) - mean number of lines recorded over 5 transects surveyed at each 300 m2 site.\r\n- Fish Line_SUM (FishLinSum) - is the pooled number of lines recorded on the 5 transects surveyed at each site. It is the total number of lines found over the 1500m2 surveyed at each site.\r\n- Line Accumulation Rate (LineAccRat) - number of lines accumulated per month.\r\n- SCI_MEAN - Structural complexity Index.. An index (1-25) calculated by multiplying our visual estimates of reef slope angle (1-5) by reef slope rugosity (Complexity 1-5). These values are estimated for each 10m section of each 50m transect. 5 transects per site = 25 SCI estimates per site. The data provided is site means¿ i.e. the mean of those 25 values.\r\n- %LHC_MEAN (LHC_MEAN) - Live hard coral cover (%), live hard coral only.  \r\n\r\n\r\nReferences:\r\n\r\nWilliamson D.H., Ceccarelli D.M., Evans R.D., Hill J.K., Russ G.R.

This data is collected using revenue quality meters across each supply line (feeder) into the plant, and Melbourne Water owned power meters for generation measurements. Melbourne Water collects and stores this feeder data as 15 minute interval data, and the generation data at real time. The data in this file summarises the electricity consumption and generation as daily usage. The time period associated with each day has been converted to a UTC time zone. This data set allows year on year comparison or daily usage against atmospheric changes i.e. temperature variance, rainfall. Feeder 1 and Feeder 2 can be combined to obtain the total Grid Electricity Consumption for ETP, and combined with the total electricity Generation to obtain the total Electricity consumption for ETP.NOTE: Whilst every effort has been taken in collecting, validating and providing the attached data, Melbourne Water Corporation makes no representations or guarantees as to the accuracy or completeness of this data. Any person or group that uses this data does so at its own risk and should make their own assessment and investigations as to the suitability and/or application of the data.

The data is by Primary Health Network (PHN) 2017 geographic boundaries based on the 2016 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nThere are 31 PHNs set up by the Australian Government. Each network is controlled by a board of medical professionals and advised by a clinical council and community advisory committee. The boundaries of the PHNs closely align with the Local Hospital Networks where possible.\nFor more information please see the data source notes on the data. \nSource: Estimates for Population Health Areas (PHAs) are modelled estimates and were produced by the ABS; estimates at the LGA and PHN level were derived from the PHA estimates.\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data. Data that was not shown/not applicable/not published/not available for the specific area ('#', '..', '^', 'np, 'n.a.', 'n.y.a.' in original PHIDU data) was removed.It has been replaced by by Blank cells.

    "description": "This record describes, and links to a working paper published through the Economics and Environment Network at The Australian National University in Canberra. The paper was prepared for the International Workshop on Fishing Vessel and License Buy-Back Programs, held at the University of California between March 22nd-24th, 2004. \n*****\nPolicy makers have implemented five distinct buybacks of either vessels or salmon licenses over the past three decades in the British Columbia (BC) salmon fishery. The earliest buyback was one of the first of its kind in any fishery and the most recent buyback is one of the largest ever in terms of reducing vessel numbers and the funds used. This paper reviews the circumstances under which these buybacks were conducted with an emphasis on their impact on reducing fishing capacity and effort. The focus is on the two most recent buybacks that took place in 1996 and 1998-2000, what has been learned and what they have achieved.",

    "description": "Australian Defence Airfields ANEF ANEC\r\n\r\nDevelopment - Australian Noise Exposure Forecast (ANEF). \r\n(Ref: https://www.defence.gov.au/AircraftNoise/Default.asp) \r\n\r\nHomeowners should be familiar with their local Australian Noise Exposure Forecast (ANEF) maps, which provide the best information about aircraft noise exposure near Defence bases. \r\n\r\nANEF maps provide a forecast of noise for a future year, made by both civilian and military aircraft for that location. They do not show every flight and homeowners with properties outside of the ANEF map zones may still experience aircraft noise. \r\n\r\nOne of the most effective ways to reduce the impact of aircraft noise is through proper land planning by local Town Councils. \r\n\r\nDepartment of Defence ANEF maps \r\n\r\nANEF maps are usually updated every five to ten years, as a result of new noise information (for example, an older aircraft may be retired and a new aircraft may be introduced) or when the current map passes its forecast date. Because ANEF maps are a forecast, the map will always include the year that is forecasted. For example, the RAAF Base Williamtown 2025 ANEF is a forecast for the year 2025, and incorporates noise modelling for the F-35A Joint Strike Fighter. \r\n\r\nProperties purchased near airports and bases are always likely to experience some degree of aircraft noise, which will increase or decrease with changes in use. \r\n\r\nANEF Maps should be read in conjunction with Australian Standard 2021 – 2000 Acoustics - Aircraft Noise Intrusion - Building Siting and Construction. \r\n\r\nhttps://www.defence.gov.au/aircraftnoise/_master/docs/anef/AS2021-2000%20Table%202-1.pdf",
